After availing the required data in a proper format for analysis to spot the opportunities through the  agile mode to fasten the processes, since we can’t forecast the impact of what we’re going to apply we  found that the most efficient approach is learning launch as it will give us flavor if it’s efficient or not  then we’ll decide if it’s the best way we can apply or there’s another way to be approached

Application

In the learning launch, we launched only one criterion we selected considering it as the best method  that would fit for our objective and will meet the customers need, accordingly the revenues will be  increased as targeted

During the first launch we’re monitoring the performance and found there’s a slight increase then we  generated a lot of ideas supported with research studies and surveys that would enhance the  performance, then we started to do a second launch with multiple segments on different samples of  customers from each segment that would be targeted with multiple campaigns

Insight

By Launch learning tool, we selected the most efficient Criterions that achieved both the highest  revenues and engagement and then we scaled up our campaigns to the whole base, in addition the time  taken in the second launch squeezed by 3x in comparison to the first launch

Approach

We learnt that we can do multiple launched but on small sample of our customers at the same time and  this will give us more flexibility and great opportunity to get what we aim to in addition to saving the  needed time to launch for ongoing marketing moves",F,F,F

I am a business administration student, businessman, entrepreneur and I like to see beyond

day, therefore, for this job the visualization tool was chosen for the characteristics it contains

that are consistent with my skills, aptitudes and capacities to develop business ideas that

could be monetized by my person or society; This visualization tool is super effective because

it places the other people involved in the same horizon with a single purpose with the person

who provides the thought of what is intended to be achieved or at least of the initiative, in

this way we begin one of the most intrepid adventures we have ever done, after the course a

group of friends and I immediately began to work on a topic where I had an idea but did not

know how to explain it to them so it came to my mind to use this method due to its simplicity

Challenge:

The challenge I want to describe was as follows, I had the opportunity of working on an

important project, which consisted on Inventory Control, the real problem was to create a different  working area for the receipt and warehouse in order to control the inventory process, so what was  needed was to think deeply on a different way to stablish a working design, this design has to be as  efficient as practical, also it needed an optimal arrangement, and finally not less important we  needed to consider the restrictions of the area because we were too limited on space.",T,T,T

Application:

To do so, First I took the measures of the warehouse, and portrayed on a piece of paper,

Then I went to my office and made the layout on AutoCAD, when I did it this way I could see where  were the problems on an easier way and practically I could communicate my ideas to my working  team, Therefor we made a list of all the possible ideas that not surpasses the restrictions of the  warehouse, and designed them on the layout.",F,F,F

your own web, you must find a way in which everything is connected and nothing is

loose

Perspective and focus

In these five weeks of the course I have learned to better organize my ideas to have

a more satisfactory learning and boy have the changes been noticeable, previously

it was too boring to write and write ideas so extensive that all they did was confuse

you and do the work more heavy, now I frequently use mind maps that in general

the only rule is that they are not extensive and the ideas can be summarized very

easily even on a napkin as well explained by Sara Ashraf

On the other hand, I could also say that the mind mapping tool not only helps me to

synthesize the information, but it can also help me to decipher it by organizing and

reviewing each of the data that is included in the mind map; This is one of the

advantages of this wonderful tool, you can organize your research in such a way that

no matter the order or how you write your data, the important thing is that you can

understand yourself and make your ideas known to others, really this It is something

that I really like and it has a very noticeable difference with the concept maps that,

as their name indicates, only serve you to memorize concepts

At the beginning, we conducted a survey through the sales team and customers where we asked their  opinion about the critical points about the printed sales cycle materials:

-  Practicality

-  Ergonomics

-  Attractiveness for customers

With the results we designed the situation of the meeting betweeen sales man and customer where  the material for the sales cycle could be showed

The main insight outcomes were very powerful: usually the space where reps could leave the printed  copies was too small and It was difficult to handle the sheets during the presentation but the baddest  news were customers are always tight to hear from the rep so they started feeling very impatient if  they saw a lot word to be read, for that reps lost sales because of that problem.",F,F,F

Application

To put the tool into practice to be able to apply the questionnaire, what I need is to  have the entire question bank ready with solutions to the value chain, in this way I  already have a reference to which sector and number of companies the questionnaire  will be applied, Then I end up selecting a specific companies willing to carry out the  questionnaire, which are ultimately two companies, then continue and understand their  specific need, which are the improvement of processes within the management of the  value chain, in this way a solution is created and plan in place for companies to make  use of those recommendations described.",F,F,T
