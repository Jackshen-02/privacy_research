Challenge

My challenge to solve is the problem of a company that is without

sufficient capital to create and build its own industrial plant, and cannot

cope with the growing demand that they have had in the last two months. The company is in a dilemma, as it has two potential investors; The first

investor offers the amount of capital necessary for the creation of the

plant, in return he asks to intervene in the process and make certain

changes in the final product since he thinks that the idea he has has

shown good results in previous years and to have the participation of 50%

in the company, the second investor offers the capital necessary for the

creation of the plant in exchange for do not make modifications to the

final product, since this is the one that is generating the exponential

growth of the company, for the moment it is only asked to focus on the

company's success product and as they recover the investment they can

be extended to the innovation of products and creation for a 20% stake

within the company."

I think that “Storytelling” played a very important role in this project, the fact of sitting  down to talk with Saman and his majority investor about the brief history of Mirror Lake Laundry and Press, the  reasons for this micro-company to be created, were its strengths and weaknesses, it helped  us a lot to “clear our picture”, and in this way to understand that, although our quick  solution had some validity, it was not enough to fill this set of problems. And it was like  that, when we took all the problems separately and solved them in the best possible way,  and then took a step back to see if we were on the right track, at that moment we realized  that we had reached the general solution, or achieved our main goal."

What are some helpful takeaways from the above? (Which would have been difficult to observe  without the visual aid)

  The US infection trajectory overtook China's on approximately the 14th day after the US  reported its 100th case

  Turkey seems to currently be on an alarming trajectory, with a doubling rate of less than  2 days

  A number of Asian countries have had early success in flattening their curves

  Italy, once the undisputed epicenter of the disease, seems to be having some success in  starting to flatten their curve as well

  It's easy to see confirmed case doubling rates, at current trajectories, given the overlaid  broken lines, from daily, to every 2 days, to every 3 days, to weekly (US is doubling almost  every 2 days; the UK is doubling approximately every 3 days)

Important thing here to note is that how to effectively use any given tool for example why the use  of log scale and the choice of using absolute numbers rather than population-adjusted rates."

Challenge

I am a teacher at the Faculty of Applied Arts, and I am teaching subjects related to industrial design (a  material called glass packaging design) which requires a focus on standards for production in addition to  creativity in design

Often this subject is taught as follows: We explain the classification of packages and how they are  produced and how the design is inspired by the various elements, but because of the large content and  content of the scientific material and the lack of time, most students are distracted and information is  lost and is not focused on them and designs are not produced    Of all students fulfills the purpose and standards established    Selection

The mind mapping tool was chosen to understand the thinking processes and their sequence and the  association of each element with what follows and what precedes it, which helps to follow and organize  ideas. It is a tool that helps to search for patterns and visions within a large amount of data (what is) and  therefore it is suitable for this subject and aims to set criteria for the stage of generating ideas (what if)."

Peer-graded assignment for ‘Design Thinking for Business Innovation’, Qaisar Johnson, 22 January  2017

Challenge

I work as engineer in a global consultancy and we have recently started to employ design thinking  tools to address challenges our clients face which were previously addressed with analytical problem- solving techniques. The most recent challenge was a request for proposal (RFP) to design the new  building for the school of music for a re-known university."
12832,Peter Thiel,PERSON,"(920, 931)",F,"Naturally we turned to the  idea of making something new, or as Peter Thiel said “Zero to One”.","Composites have long been the most  important materials in the history of aviation, and it seemed obvious to take up a challenging  project that would impact material engineering in a positive way. Naturally we turned to the  idea of making something new, or as Peter Thiel said “Zero to One”. After months of  research, and reading various publications, we arrived at “3-D Weaving of Composite  Fabrics” ."
12832,Frank Klose,PERSON,"(1354, 1365)",F,"Week four in the course helped me incline towards learning launch, the fun ways of  solving problems told by Frank Klose grabbed my attention immediately.","A field relatively unexplored by institutes and many OEM’s like Boeing and  Airbus. Week four in the course helped me incline towards learning launch, the fun ways of  solving problems told by Frank Klose grabbed my attention immediately. So, it seemed  appropriate to use the tool learning launch, as it would help us identify the problems early in  the project phase; that being said visual mapping was also used to navigate during brain  storming sessions."

If appropriate to the situation, I will borrow the concept to “frontstage/back-stage” from previous research, and  discussed in David Gray’s book, “The Connected Company”. The frontstage/back-stage approach helps to reinforce  the notion that every service – even an internal service – has customers with whom the service provider interacts  and internal processes that enable the organization to provide the service."

Here we remember what Einstein  said: ""Big problems cannot be faced and we are at the same level of thinking that we were  when we created these problems. ""

Here, a very deep mental perception appears to us, so that nothing improves without  changing the way you think and perceive it, so visualizing things is one of the most important  reasons for success."

After we changed the format and used the storyline methodology to get feedback from our  stakeholders on the co-creation of GTM we observed

• Many of the calls started of with background noise and distractions, but once we

started the story the stakeholders were curious and didn’t want to miss out on the plot,  they asked us to hold and moved to quieter area

• There was much more engagement from the stakeholders, they asked about the

details and wanted to know more about the story and the actors in the story

• The calls lasted much longer, and stakeholders at times even cancelled or postponed

their next calls to stay on

• And it was not only about the stakeholders, but we as team felt more energy and

positive about the process

• We got pages of notes from each call as feedback, and several new ideas that we had

not thought about

Approach

We used the storyline methodology a little by accident and in an adhoc method.

a job-experience of youth project. And the main item of the project was related to the Non-

One of the tools that I used in the strategic planning process with the Association was ‘Mind  Mapping’. Mind mapping as defined by Zinhle Kumar in the Mind Mapping Video in  Idea Generation model ‘is looking for patterns and themes in your data’. It is more a visual and  engaging way of looking at the data and it allows us to ‘extract meaning from data in a way that  lets patterns and insights emerge’ something that you might not get if you are only looking at  each data set separately."

In the Design Thinking Storytelling video, Luis Scott mentioned, “Storytelling is the  difference between solving a problem and creating a cause. ” I realize now that we had been  trying to solve a problem the first time around, but in our redesigned ‘Unlock Fiduciaria’  approach, we were creating a cause—inspiring customers to learn more—by highlighting only  the most critical details about features that had real-life applicability."

To conduct these reviews, we could attempt to use a highly data-driven approach, but I believe that  storytelling would bring much more engagement and would enable senior managers to think in more  holistic terms about the relationship between management culture and business results.

It will also help us overcome a common risk,  which is to create a process that seems to be driven by HR, distinct from the realities of the business."
