    "teacher: Hi Emma Johnson, hope I didn't get you up too early!\nstudent: Don't worry, my exam is next Saturday, so I should get up early.\nteacher: Ah OK, so good practice then...is that an IELTS exam?\nstudent: Exactly.\nteacher: I've lost track of how many you've done\nstudent: I hope I can do as well as usual at the real exam.haha\nteacher: Do you mean get a score you get in practice tests?\nstudent: Yes, I managed to get 37 on reading yesterday!!\nteacher: Wow that's really good - well done...you've definitely made a lot of progress. And what's your normal score on listening these days?\nstudent: Around 30, the listening is harder for me.\nteacher: OK that's quite common to be better at reading - but 30 is still more than respectable. I guess maybe speaking is the toughest part?\nstudent: Yeah, because it's difficult to practice...\nteacher: Yeah sure - I guess what we're doing right now is a weird mixture of speaking and writing....because you're kind of under pressure to reply straight away like in speaking you know?\nstudent: You're right. I'm trying to reply as soon as possible.\nteacher: Yes well don't worry too much - are you doing this one on your phone like you said you might? IS it quicker/easier?\nstudent: Yeah, I'm using my phone, it's better than the last time, isn't it??\nteacher: I'd say you're definitely faster yeah - this is me at maximum speed I'm afraid!\nstudent: It's good for me. haha\nteacher: :) Listen Emma Johnson I thought I'd try something a bit more specific if that's OK - so here goes...\nteacher: What\u2019s the connection?  Tokyo/Japan\nstudent: Do you mean my hometown?\nteacher: No I mean: what's the connection between those two words?\nstudent: Ah, it's the capital city\nteacher: OK yes! Tell me a sentence can you please?\nteacher: I mean with that exact example.\nstudent: Tokyo is the capital city in Japan.\nteacher: OK thanks - is there another capital city in Japan?\nstudent: No, there is only one.\nteacher: Ah ok so...Tokyo....?\nstudent: Tokyo is the capital!!\nteacher: You got it! OK another one: What's the connection: Pacific/Everest\nstudent: Mt.Everest is the highest in the Pacific...?\nteacher: OK just tell me about the second one...Mt Everest is....?\nstudent: the highest mountain in the Pacific??\nteacher: Sorry Emma Johnson! I mean write this in a  full sentence: Mt Everest/highest/world\nstudent: Mt Everest is the highest in the Pacific world.\nstudent: I'm not sure, sorry.\nteacher: That's OK my fault! OK this is what I was thinking of: Mt Everest is the highest mountain in the world. Can you now do a sentence with the ocean (forget about connecting it to Mt Everest!) THanks\nstudent: The Pacific is the widest ocean in the world!!\nteacher: OK thanks great! And one more with this keyword: Sahara\nstudent: The Sahara is the largest desert in the world.\nteacher: OK thanks Emma Johnson. I wanted to check this area (or part of it at first) for articles! Does that you make you change any of your answers?\nstudent: Sure, it's okay.\nteacher: I'll give you a clue: if you are talking about oceans/deserts/rivers you need....?\nteacher: the the the the the the the the but only once obviously\nstudent: Do I need to use 'the'??\nteacher: Yes!\nteacher: So, do one again with Sahara can you?\nstudent: The Sahara is the largest desert in the world!!\nteacher: Perfect! OK Emma Johnson,can you choose one desert, one river and one ocean and tell me anything you like about each one? THanks\nteacher: Start with just river if you like\nstudent: The Thames is the most famous river in the UK.\nteacher: Thanks great example ..and nice that you know you can just say The Thames if you like and not always the river Thames\nteacher: OK do a ocean/sea or desert OK?\nstudent: I don't know much about desertsl...so I'm talking about an ocean.\nteacher: OK fine (Sorry by the way it should the River Thames as in River with a capital r !)\nstudent: The Atlantic is the ocean between Europe and America.\nteacher: OK thanks Emma Johnson - correct 'the Atlantic' perfect (I didn't understand the bit about 'is known that ' though I'm afraid!\nstudent: Sorry, it was an unnecessary part!!\nteacher: Ok no problem! Listen Emma Johnson can you tell me about any famous places (like buildings) you have visited in the UK - just one sentnce is enough\nstudent: Brighton is one of the best resort places in Europe.\nteacher: OK thanks - yes I remember you said you went there. It's pretty cool right? What did you like about it?\nteacher: And what did you do/where did you go hen you were there?\nstudent: I also went to Bournemouth, but Brighton is more attractive to me. Due to the landscape.\nstudent: I ate some seafood, it was good.\nteacher: OK right - I guess you've noticed that seafood is not the most common food for English people to eat! Can you give me an example of a specific place (like a building) you have visited in Cambridge.\nteacher: I mean a well-known place\nteacher: Not like your bathroom or something!\nstudent: Sure. It's King's College, the garden was really beautiful.\nteacher: OK yes nice example - a really famous one.What about any museums?\nstudent: I like the Fitzwilliam Museum, I'm not sure about the spelling\nteacher: No that's correct Emma Johnson! So you said your two examples correctly: The Fitzwilliam and King's College (without 'the') - do you know the (semi) rule?!\nstudent: I think facilities like museums need to have 'the'...\nteacher: Yes good point! So hotels/theatres/cinemas/museums/galleries etc have 'the' - can you give me another  example of one of these you've been to?\nstudent: The Light cinema is near to my house.\nteacher: Ah you live quite centrally - I'm jealous! (sort of) And e.g. King's College/Barclay's (bank)/St Mary's Church do NOT have 'the' - can you see what they have in common?!\nstudent: It's owned by someone like the King, St Mary and Barclay??\nteacher: Yeah that's it basically! so the 'someone' is the important bit - a name! Can you give me another example of a place like this?\nstudent: I have no idea except Queen's College...\nteacher: No that's fine! Correct example! One final test: where does Donald trump work? The building I mean...\nteacher: It's got the name of a colour in it...and it's not black!\nstudent: The White House. haha\nteacher: yes good! But is the colour named after a person or is it just a colour?\nteacher: do you think?\nteacher: it's just a colour so...it's called...?\nstudent: Hmmm, the White House!!\nteacher: Yay!\nteacher: OK thank's Emma Johnson -we'll leave it there ok? Good to talk to you again.\nstudent: Okay, thank you!!\nteacher: I'll be in touch - feel free to send me an email yourself!\nstudent: Sure, see you.\nteacher: OK bye...",
    "teacher: Hi Amy Smith - are you there?!\nstudent: Hi\nstudent: Yes, here I am :)\nteacher: Hi there - good to speak to you!\nteacher: Amy Smith - can you tell me something about yourself - whatever you like...\nstudent: ok\nstudent: I'm from Spain, from Tenerife. I came back home a week ago and I'm very happy to see the sun again.\nteacher: OK yes I can imagine! It's pretty cold here in Cambridge at the moment (sunny though!). Do you travel to the  UK often?\nstudent: At the moment I'm not working so I have a lot of free time to go for walks outside and enjoy the good weather\nteacher: What's your normal work?\nstudent: About traveling to the UK, I don't go often. I lived there for 5 years until 2014 and then I went again at the end of October 2019\nteacher: Ah right - yes I thought you seemed very fluent - as in the thetype of fluency you get from living in a country...\nteacher: Where were you based when you were here?\nstudent: In my last job I worked as a careers advisor (not sure about the spelling)\nteacher: It's careers!\nstudent: oh thank you!\nteacher: Do you have any plans for future work?\nstudent: I'm not sure about what to do, I've done a few different things... I really enjoy teaching so I'm planning on taking a course to become a teacher for unemployed people. To help them to improve their qualifications\nteacher: OK I see - that sounds very valuable. Would you do that in Tenerife? Is there high unemployment there?\nstudent: Yes, I'd like to do it here. Unemployment is quite high in all of Spain, especially in the south\nteacher: Yes I thought it probably was. I lived in Spain (in Cadiz and Granada) for a few years - but nearly 20 years ago now - it was a problem then too. Too reliant on tourism etc. Do you think there is a solution?\nstudent: Oh really? Do you speak Spanish? I love Andalusia but it has always been difficult to find a job there...\nstudent: No idea about a solution\nteacher: Me neither (on the solution!) - well, in theory I speak Spanish but I'm afriad I'm pretty rusty these days - of course I can understand and I could regain fluency with some practice I guess but as I say it's deteriorated over the years...\nteacher: My partner has kept it up much more as she has South American friends here in CAmbridge - I'm a bit jealous to be honest especially as I used to be better than her!\nstudent: Unemployment is really bad but it has always given me an opportunity to work. There are always vacancies to work as a careers advisor and I did a master's in that boring topic\nteacher: Ha! Quite ironic ! I guess it's a little bit similar to me teaching English in some countries where there is high unemployment - sometimes I felt a bit guilty because ogten in reality better English didn't really make any difference to their job prospects!\nstudent: haha I know, it's very difficult to keep up a language if you don't practise\nteacher: Yes I guess that's why you''re keen to keep up your ENglish right? I'll stop typing for a minute to avoid overlap\nstudent: Same for me, I work trying to help people to get jobs but there are no jobs. I think it is our government's strategy to keep people entertained so they don't complain so much\nstudent: Oh sorry, we are getting some overlap... It would be great to be able to see if the other is typing\nteacher: I see what you mean...like we said it's difficult to see a solution unfortunately. I guess you need to get a competitive advantage in something right? As in something beyond food production etc\nteacher: Yes I know about the overlap - I think it's something the developer can work on\nteacher: Amy Smith - you mentioned in your form that you wanted to do a few grammar areas - can you tell me about something you regret?!\nstudent: Fun topic!\nteacher: sorry! lie if you like...\nstudent: No, I won't lie\nstudent: I regret not studying teaching, but I think I was too young to know what I wanted at that time\nstudent: Is it correct??\nteacher: OK...so if you use the actual word 'regret' you need to say regret something/regret doing something - try again\nstudent: ok\nstudent: I regret not studying teaching??\nteacher: That's it! You can also say: I regret not having studied teaching - more formal but the first one very common in speaking if no danger of confusion\nteacher: I mean over time\nstudent: I see. I don't tend to use that verb\nteacher: Tell me more about what what you wish (about the teaching thing) if you like\nstudent: Sorry, I don't usually use that verb\nteacher: It's a common verb so sounds good\nteacher: less common as a noun\nstudent: I understand\nteacher: Maybe English peoplle regret  things more!\nstudent: hahah I don't think so, but maybe I don't like to think too much about the things that I can't change in the present\nteacher: Yes of course - good advice in general!\nstudent: I'll tell you more about what I wish\nteacher: ok\nstudent: When I finished my master's I worked as a volunteer teaching Spanish to African inmigrants and then I realised I really enjoyed teaching. It was too late, I had already spent 7 years at university studying something else\nstudent: I wish I had studied a master's in Spanish as a second language\nteacher: OK I see - good grammar by the way! - I guess teachign positions in Spain are quite controlled. Did you ever teach Spanish in the uK?\nstudent: Yes, it's always easier to teach Spanish in another country. I had some students, I used to teach at home. I also taught in an early years school. It wasn't a subject, it was a club\nstudent: How can I say that properly??\nteacher: Um...do you mean like an after-school club?\nstudent: Exactly\nteacher: Yeah OK if it's like an optional activity that's what we call it but 'a club' is fine\nteacher: Did you enjoy teaching kids - or do you prefer adults?\nstudent: I see. I worked at the same school as a teaching assistant and I also taught Spanish\nstudent: I very much prefer to teach adults\nteacher: Yes me too to be honest! Unfortunately the English teaching industry is more and more dominated by classes for young poeple\nstudent: I don't enjoy teaching children because I have the feeling that I waste too much energy asking for their attention\nstudent: I see a lot of adults learning English in Cambridge\nstudent: Are there more young students than adults?\nteacher: Sure - a lot of it is crowd control - some people are good at it - it's like a vocation I guess. I do really admire those teachers - that's why I don't consider myself a really great teacher to be honest!  Yes there are more young people overall - definitely in my school too!\nteacher: I often escape them though because i specialise in exam teaching - like IELTS/CAE etc\nstudent: Yes, I completely agree. I think to work with children you have to love the way they are.\nteacher: Amy Smith - we'll finish at 2:00 OK? so I'll ask you to have a quick look at the following:\nstudent: OK\nteacher: A few things from earlier to think about: \u2022 I walk outside (in the good weather) \u2022 There\u2019s high unemployment in all Spain \u2022 It has been always difficult to find work \u2022 There\u2019s a possibility to work.. \u2022Vacancies to work in teaching\u2026 \u2022 (I wish I\u2019d) studied a Master\u2019s in\u2026\nteacher: Change anything you like (one by one if you like - you decide)\nstudent: I'm not sure about what I have to do. Are these the sentences that I wrote??\nteacher: Yes! Sorry I thought you'd recognize them! Yes have a go at identifying any issues\nstudent: The first one: I walk outdoors\nteacher: OK thanks - do you walk inside? Normally we'd say go for a walk (as in for fun/in the countryside whatever) more common anyway\nstudent: I see, thank you\nteacher: Any others?\nstudent: yes, I'll try with the second one\nstudent: The unemployment is high in the whole country (not sure)\nteacher: all Spain' is not wrong just a bit unusual - all of Spain or various alternative obviously: all over Spain/through (more formal) Spain/ yes whole country = fine definitely not THE unemploymen though!\nteacher: sorry I meant throughout Spain\nstudent: OK, thanks\nteacher: next one =word order do you see it?\nstudent: It has always been very difficult to find a job\nstudent: It has always been\nstudent: sorry\nteacher: That's OK that's it yes!\nteacher: change the word possiblity\nstudent: Thanks, I'll go for the next one\nstudent: there is a chance to work??\nteacher: yes good! or opportunity of course = both good. possibility is more like a statistical thing you know\nteacher: vacancy + preposition?\nstudent: No, I don't understand the 'statistical thing'\nteacher: OK so for example: there's a possibility it will rain\nstudent: Ah I understand now\nstudent: vacancies for\nstudent: vacancies for working in\nteacher: basically for a Spanish speaker you normally need to say chance/opportunity when you want to say possibility! YEs good vacancy for - change the verb in the last one\nstudent: And the last one?? I don't know how to change it\nteacher: That's ok - study a master's in not wrong but much more common to say 'do'\nteacher: much much more\nstudent: OK, I didn't know... I translated directly from Spanish\nteacher: yes of course\nstudent: Thank you very much\nteacher: Listen Amy Smith - it was good to speak to you today - by the way of course you're English is great! I'll email you soon to confirm what we want to do OK?\nstudent: Thank you, this is a very good exercise for me because I don't like writing. Thank you, I have a lot to improve\nstudent: I'll be waiting for your email.\nteacher: OK no problem - you did fine! OK thanks a lot - speak soon\nstudent: Speak soon! Have a good afternoon",
    "teacher: Hi Emily, are you there?!\nstudent: Hello. Yes, I'm here.\nteacher: Hi there - good to speak to you again. Emily, I thought I'd make this lesson a bit more focused so here goes! Can i ask you to write a sentnece using the following information: Pacific/biggest\nstudent: The Pacific Ocean is the biggest ocean in the world.\nteacher: Thank you - another one: Nile/longest\nstudent: The Nile is the longest river in the world.\nteacher: OK nearly there! Everest/Himalayas\nstudent: Mt. Everest is the highest in the Himalayas.\nteacher: Thanks - USA/50 states\nstudent: The USA has 50 states.\nteacher: OK last one: London/south/ UK Newcastle/north\nstudent: London is in the south of the UK while Newcastle is in the north.\nteacher: OK Emily thanks a lot for that - I was checking your use of articles with geographical features etc as you might have guessed  - you've passed with flying colours! I'll think of some more stuff to challenge you! In the meantime, I thought I'd revisit a bit of vocabulary you did in the lesson at Studio the other day ok? give me a second\nstudent: What does 'flying colours' mean?\nteacher: Do you remember the lesson you did with the folowing adjectives? e.g. relieved/confused/optimistic/annoyed etc? Could you give me a setence (true if possible) to describe a time you expereinced any of these feelings I just mentioned in the list?\nteacher: Oh sorry - in this context it means you passed to a high standard\nteacher: you got a high mark basically\nstudent: Oh, I see. Thank you for telling me.\nstudent: I was really relieved to hear my husband say my cooking was delicious.\nteacher: I checked the origin of the flying colours phrase - apparently it comes from the NAvy when a ship would return with colours displayed to show it had been victorious in a battle\nteacher: f you get a very high mark in e.g. a university degree you might receive a 'distinction' if you're familiar with that idea\nteacher: Thanks for your example with relieved -  try another adjective when you're ready\nstudent: That's interesting. Thank you for telling me the origin of the phrase.\nteacher: THat's OK - do you know the word 'nautical'? as in related to the sailing - there are loads of phrases related to this area in English\nstudent: Oh, I didn't know that word. Maybe that's because the UK is an island country.\nstudent: Sorry, my next example...\nstudent: I was confused when I heard about my grandmother's death.\nstudent: I didn't use to be optimistic when I was a student.\nteacher: Yeah - and remember it has a very strong naval tradition - that's what kept the BRitish Empire going for so long! I'll get some examples for our next lesson of common phrases derived from this. OK thanks for your confused example - sorry if it's a sad subject ...but this suggests you didn't understand something....is that true for your example?\nstudent: Yes, unfortunately it's true and I went back to Japan two weeks ago because of this. I was so confused because she had been absolutely fine until that day.\nteacher: OK thanks I understand. I think maybe 'shocked' is better here.\nteacher: Emily, can you give me the missing two words in the following: I\u2019m optimistic _______ my chances of winning. I was confused ______ the explanation.\nstudent: I'm optimistic for... and I was confused with...?\nstudent: Ah, I understood that 'shocked' is better.\nteacher: OK thanks - we normally say 'optimistic about' and 'confused by'. Can you try to think of two more examples using these structures correctly (true if possible!)\nstudent: Oh, it's difficult! I was annoyed by the cancellation of my train.\nteacher: It's OK, that's a good example thanks!\nteacher: Emily, look at these two groups of adjectives  - which preposition do you need with group 1 and group 2? \u2022 Happy/sad/excited/worried \u2022 Shocked/puzzled/surprised\nstudent: About for 1, and by for 2, right?\nteacher: Yes that's it good! You can kind of see the similarity with the adjective groups - though it's not exactly a rule!\nteacher: Could you try a sentence with: impressed and bored\nstudent: I think group 1 is more emotional... is that right?\nstudent: I was impressed by her works.\nstudent: I was bored with his story.\nteacher: Yeah I guess that's true...also, it's more like a reaction to a general situation and the others are often assciated with a smaller, more contained event\nteacher: sorry not a great explanation but you get the idea?!\nstudent: Hmm... I have to get used to it!\nteacher: THanks - 'impressed by' or 'with' is good. 'bored of' is possible and peopel say it in real life though some more careful speakers prefer 'bored with' = more 'correct'\nstudent: Thank you. I understood.\nteacher: I'll think again about my explanation before and improve it for next time with examples!\nstudent: Thank you. Is there any rule??\nstudent: Sorry, 'rules'\nteacher: One last task on this topic Emily: could you tell me a time you were: suspicious/curious By the way, sorry no rule! Adjectives + prepositions is a bit unpredictable I'm afraid...\nteacher: Rule inthe singular was OK because you can think of all adjectives together in one group\nstudent: I see. Thank you.\nteacher: e.g. you can imagine one rule covering everything or many rules\nstudent: I was suspicious of his story.\nstudent: I am curious about the group activity.\nteacher: THanks Emily - 'suspicious of' is much more common but 'about' is OK too! curious about is good...\nstudent: Wow.. there are many kinds of preposition!\nteacher: Yeah sorry - keep using them and it will become automatic - Do you know the nouns? Take a quick look back and write the nouns of any of the adjectives you've done...\nteacher: 4 or 5 if you like\nstudent: Do you mean like 'curiosity?'\nteacher: Exactly\nstudent: impression, relief, confusion,excitement\nteacher: Thanks - could you choose two of those and give me an example?\nstudent: The film made an impression on me.\nteacher: Thanks Emily - do you mean : I was impressed by the film?\nstudent: Yes. Is that correct?\nteacher: Sorry I mean Emily - unfortunate error!\nteacher: You need to say: the film made an impression on me\nstudent: Make an impression.... and this time I need 'on'\nstudent: Thank you for telling me.\nteacher: If you use the adjective form it's more normal to mean it in a straight-forward positive sense whereas the noun phrase is slightly more ambiguous (probably basically positive though)\nstudent: The accident caused traffic chaos.\nteacher: Thanks - the noun confusion goes with e.g. cause so for example: the mistake caused a great deal of confusion - for traffic we'd say something like 'chaos' maybe as in the accident caused (that verb again - or led to etc) traffic chaos\nteacher: Could you try relief or excitement? I thin k this is useful...\nstudent: The result of an exam was a relief to me.\nteacher: THanks Emily - yes, good example and you can say a relief FOR...it's common to say: it was relief to me. Also the phrase is quite common: it came as a relief to me\nteacher: which is maybe less familiar to you (again, with 'familiar' you could say 'for' but 'to' is more normal\nteacher: much more normal\nteacher: Last question Emily - do you know 'relieve' as a verb? Culd you give me an example of that?!\nstudent: OK... I have a lot of things to learn today!\nteacher: We can stop there if you like! Give me  a second...(or continue with example if you prefer!\nstudent: Ah, of course it's OK! His story relieved me.\nteacher: THanks - a logical example...but (!) ...have you seen for example adverts for painkillers? They always say 'fast,efffective pain relief' ...so...what can you releive\nteacher: I mean relieve\nstudent: I can relieve pain?\nteacher: That's it! It nearly always goes with e.g. relieve pain/worry/traffic congestion (!) - stuff like that\nteacher: OK Emily thanks for today - did you prefer the lesson today? Would you like more of the same?\nstudent: I see. It seems to be a very useful word.\nstudent: Thank you. I could learn a lot!\nteacher: OK great...I'll contact you soon for the next lesson OK?\nstudent: Of course!\nteacher: OK thanks take care\nstudent: You, too. Thank you. See you next time.",
    "teacher: Hi Sophia - you made it home!\nstudent: Hi Ms. Lopez, yeah I've just arrived home.\nteacher: I'm jealous...sometimes it takes me 45 minutes to drive home in the rush hour...\nstudent: Oh, I'm sorry for you. I can walk to school in 5 minutes, haha\nteacher: Yes you're 'just round the corner'...Sophia, I've planned to ask you to do some stuff on vocabulary today - words to describe people's personality. Can you give me one or two(!) to describe yourself?\nstudent: I'm lazy and selfish, haha\nteacher: Really?! Maybe most of us are sometimes....any positive ones?!\nstudent: Ah, I'm sometimes told I'm mature for my age.\nteacher: OK, you mean people sometimes say you're mature?\nstudent: Yeah.\nteacher: OK right - that's good I guess! You can say: people say....OR it's sometimes said (that) I'm....OR 'I'm said to be mature' - the last two are more formal...\nteacher: Sophia - can you think of a more negative version of the following adjectives? (These examples have a mostly positive feel to them \u2013 if there are two connected by a slash they basically have the same meaning e.g.. frank/direct). If there are any you don\u2019t understand you can leave them out for now! I\u2019ll give you a minute. If you like you can choose any one word and write a negative version if you don\u2019t want to do them all in one go. You decide \u2013 I\u2019ll wait\u2026. \u2022 determined \u2022 economical/good with money \u2022 self-confident \u2022 innocent \u2022 ambitious \u2022 assertive \u2022 unconventional/original  \u2022 frank/direct\nstudent: determined\u2192I don't know\nteacher: That's OK - choose one you know...\nstudent: self-confident\u2192\nstudent: over confident??\nteacher: Good idea! Yes absolutely it's possible...maybe we use it often for one occasion. More generally we might say arrogant\nteacher: Do another one if you can...\nstudent: Hmmm. No, I can't.\nteacher: OK no problem - I'll give you some examples and you tell me which one they match with OK? weird\nstudent: Okay\nteacher: OK so 'weird' is a bit negative -what's the more positive version in the list before?\nstudent: unconventional/original\nteacher: That's it! OK one more: tight-fisted\nstudent: economical/good with money\nteacher: OK well done - what about stubborn?\nstudent: determined!!\nteacher: Yes! 'pushy'?\nstudent: I'm not sure, but is it frank/direct??\nteacher: If you push (yourself or somebody else) it's like you want to go forward you know? Try again!\nstudent: Ah. Then is it ambitious??\nteacher: Yes that's it! OK I'll do two more - next = 'naive'\nstudent: innocent??\nteacher: Right! and 'abrupt' = frank/direct\nteacher: If you're speak frankly/directly is it good?\nteacher: I mean if you speak\nstudent: It depends on situations, but I think it's generally good.\nteacher: Yes you're absolutely right - if you need tobe frank/direct then maybe it's like honest/open or just saying what needs to be said but...if it's rude/insensitive or just seems like a rude/agressive question/request for example then we'd say 'abrupt'\nstudent: Yeah, I can understand.\nteacher: OK Sophia I'll do a few more before asking you some more general questions OK?  Could you think of any opposites for these words to describe people? again, do one at a time if you like or do them all \u2013 I\u2019ll wait\u2026! \u2022 clever \u2022 extroverted \u2022 rude \u2022 cruel \u2022 generous \u2022 unsociable\nstudent: stupid, \u00d7 , \u00d7 ,polite,gentle, \u00d7 ,sociable\nteacher: OK thanks - stupid, sociable, polite = all good sure...what about shy, kind,tight-fisted?\nteacher: Sorry, I've realised I've given you the answers in the correct order!\nteacher: OK Sophia... write an adjective we\u2019ve looked at to complete the following examples \u2013 I\u2019ll give you a minute\u2026  An ______ person wants to be promoted. If you think everybody will be nice and kind and no-one will try to rob you then you are a bit __________. Some parents make their kids do loads of lessons like violin, karate, extra maths etc etc they are really __________. If you want to succeed at the highest level in sport you have to work really hard and be really _______________ to get to the top.  Sometimes people from northern Europe are quite direct \u2013 it\u2019s OK if you\u2019re used to it but they definitely offend British people sometimes because they seem a bit ___________.\nstudent: extroverted\u2192shy, cruel\u2192kind, generous\u2192tight-fisted\nteacher: Yes you're right! we'll come back to those OK/\nstudent: ambitious,naive,pushy,ambitious,shy\nteacher: Thanks Sophia - some good answers. Ambitious is fine - what about if you are prepared to work hard and are not going to give up? And...these peopel from e.g. Germany/Norway etc seem rude so a word like that  rather than 'shy'\nteacher: E.g. change your last two answers\nstudent: determined,unsociable\nteacher: Thanks - determined is great -  the last one is a bit tricky it's true. We could say 'rude' in general and it's for talking and/or actions. 'Abrupt' is one we use to describe kind of rude speaking\nstudent: Ah, okay!!\nteacher: You could be abrupt with a stranger or someone you know (if you're just a rude person in general or maybe you;re in a bad mood or whatever - do you see?\nteacher: So you say something impatiently/rudely\nstudent: This example is understandable.\nteacher: OK Sophia thanks...Choose one adjective from the ones we\u2019ve looked at to describe yourself/or someone you know and give me some evidence (as in something you/they did/said that makes it clear)! I\u2019ll give you a minute to write\u2026\nteacher: Think of a real example/event if you can...\nstudent: I came here to study English because if I can speak English, it'll be a big advantage in my career. Thus, I may be ambitious.\nteacher: I'll give you an example just beacuse I feel like it: My wife gets annoyed with me for being tight-fisted...like if we go out for a meal sometimes I won't have a dessert because I don't want to pay for it...this really winds her up...\nteacher: Thanks for your example Sophia - give me a second\nteacher: Yes I guess you might be ambitious in terms of your career - are you?!\nstudent: Yes, I am.\nteacher: OK! Sorry remind me: what are your plans?\nstudent: I should write my graduate thesis for my university and find a job, then I'm starting working 2 years later.\nteacher: OK right ..and you're planning to work for....?\nstudent: I want to get a job related to trade.\nteacher: OK right yes I remember now, sorry! Sophia ,try one more adjective example if you can...\nstudent: My sister wants to visit the UK, so she has become tight-fisted.\nteacher: Ah OK - so she's saving up right? Good example...will she come when you're still here?\nstudent: No, it's impossible, but she wants to visit here someday.\nteacher: OK did you tell her England was worth coming to?!\nstudent: Yeah, she loves Harry Potter, so that's why.\nteacher: OK I see - I guess British films and books do a lot for the tourism industry! Listen Sophia, thanks for today, - I'll recycle some of the vocabulary for the next lesson OK? Quite a few new/tricky words maybe....I'll be in touch...bye!\nstudent: Okay, thank you!!\nteacher: cheers",
    "teacher: Hi Emily, is that you?!\nstudent: Hi Ms. Emily Collins\nstudent: I can see more people here, is it right?\nteacher: Hi there, how's it going?\nteacher: No it's only us I think..\nstudent: I'm very well, thank you. How about you?\nteacher: Yeah fine thanks...not so busy at the moment to be honest. I finished the teacher training course stuff\nstudent: That's good!!\nteacher: Yes, I've got to buy a car, which is fine but a bit stressful you know\nteacher: I'm trying to decide between the crap tight-fisted option or a newer more xpensive car\nstudent: Ugh, I can imagine. I think it takes time, looking for the one you like and trying different ones... (do you say 'trying' for cars?)\nteacher: You say 'try out' for a car - a good phrasal verb!\nstudent: Thank you!\nteacher: But you can just say try of course\nteacher: It just makes it slightly less formal\nteacher: to use the phrasal verb i mean\nstudent: I see\nteacher: But very very common in speech of course\nteacher: So I tried a few - 'had a test drive we say' - and of course the most expensive one qwas by far the nicest to drive\nteacher: a volkswagen golf\nteacher: so now I'm finding it difficult to face buying a crapper cheaper car\nstudent: hahaha\nteacher: yeah....so sorry I'll wait for you to reply - do you drive?\nstudent: If you don't want to spend a lot  I guess you shouldn't try out a good one\nteacher: yes you're right of course - i guess that was me kinda deciiding really just by trying it out\nteacher: so i thin k i'll borrow the money and just enjoy driving it!\nstudent: yes, I drive but I'm not interested in cars... I have never been. My father loves cars so he bought mine long time ago and it is still working very well\nteacher: OK I see - yes I'm not really that bothered about cars in general - I've had a Nissan for 12 years\nstudent: I wouldn't like to spend money on a car\nteacher: Yeah I understand what you mean - i'm not normally extravagant with stuff\nteacher: spend 'on' by the way - you knew that right?\nstudent: I understand what you mean too.\nstudent: spend on, yes!!! thanks\nteacher: OK - I don't care what it looks like really - but it was fun to drive!\nstudent: So then you should borrow the money and enjoy driving it!\nteacher: Yes I think you're right! Hey Emily, thinking about cars and your phrasal verb before ...driving is a rich area for that language\nstudent: I don't like driving but it is definitely better when the car is comfortable\nteacher: Can you tell me about any driving incidents or expereinces you might want to explain in English?\nteacher: I'll give you a minute OK?\nstudent: ok\nstudent: I have been lucky on the road so far, I haven't had many incidents. Once I had a little accident going to work (on my first day)\nstudent: maybe 'on the road'\nstudent: I continue\nteacher: ok\nstudent: I was trying to get onto a main road, and a car didn't stop so that it crashed into my car. The driver was a very young girl and her father was also in the car\nteacher: Oh no! I'll wait ...\nstudent: They got out of their car and apologised because it was clearly their fault. It wasn't very serious but my car got damaged\nteacher: OK so no-one was badly hurt - that's the importnat thing\nstudent: I was nervous because I didn't want to be late for work so I just took their telephone number\nteacher: and on your first day you said - you mean of driving or of your job?\nstudent: The funny thing was that they rang their insurance company earlier than me and made up a story\nstudent: They said that it was my fault so I had to fix my car and pay for it. I learnt the lesson ;)\nteacher: Oh no! I guess you can never tell what people are going to do...\nteacher: Thanks Emily -  Yes we say \u2018on the road\u2019 to talk in general \u2013 \u2018in\u2019 the road is like a specific place in space do you see?  So for example do we say sleep \u2018in\u2019 or \u2018on\u2019 the street for rough sleepers do you think?\nstudent: I don't really understand your question '-you mean of driving or of your job?'\nstudent: It was my first day at work 10 years ago\nteacher: Sorry I meant was it your first day driving after you passed your test or your first day at your new job but you've answered that now I see...!\nstudent: OK thank you!\nstudent: About on or in the road\nstudent: I would say that they sleep on the street\nstudent: Is it correct?\nteacher: Yes that's right! Because it's not a real spot you know...OK Emily - look at at the following phrases/words and then back at your story and tell me how you can use them ok?\nteacher: pull out / get out / shaken up / get my car fixed / - if you don't know one just leave it\nteacher: as in you need to replace/correct with these\nstudent: I'll try...\nstudent: No idea about pull out\nstudent: I think I should have said 'they got out of their car...'\nteacher: Yes! Sorry one more: ironically you don\u2019t really say \u2018come out\u2019 of a car and you don\u2019t say \u2018do\u2019 a stop really BUT you can say \u2018come to a stop\u2019 (often implies gradually) \u2013 you know that phrase right? Like \u2018come to an end\u2019 and similar phrases\nteacher: Actually because gradually not really appropriate in your story to be honest...\nstudent: Yes, I know 'come to an end' but I didn't know 'come to a stop.' How do you use it??\nteacher: Well ...for example ...if your car runs out of petrol it might start making noises and then come to a stop by the side of the road  (as in slowly/gradually/not all of a suddden)\nstudent: I'll try to use 'shaken up' now. 'I was shaken up' instead of 'I was nervous'??\nteacher: Or a plane might skid across the runway and then come to a stop etc...!\nteacher: Yes that's good for shaken up!\nteacher: By the experience you know - suggests soemthing a bit more traumatic or with an adrenaline rush\nstudent: Now I understand how to use 'come to a stop'. Thanks!\nteacher: although I understand maybe you wre just saying nervous because you were worried about getting to work\nteacher: but 'shaken up' definitely common/good for this event\nstudent: But how do you say that there was a stop sign and she didn't do it?? That was the reason why her car crashed into mine\nteacher: Ah OK ... well, it the US they say 'run a stop sign' which is logical...wait a sec\nteacher: but for me as a BRitish person I guess I'd say maybe 'I had right of way' or 'it was my right of way'\nteacher: The thing is we don't really have signs saying STOP on them in the UK you see\nstudent: I understand\nteacher: So \u2018pull out\u2019 is when you drive from one road onto another (especially from a junction)\nteacher: As in you're stopped and then you move into the traffic/other road - it's really  common\nstudent: Really?? haha I didn't know that (no stop signs in the UK)\nteacher: No!Do you know I remember the first time I went to Spain I was really confused when I Saw a stop sigh because it was written in English!\nstudent: hahahah that's funny\nteacher: Listen Emily - 'pull' = really common for driving i.e. pull out/pull in/ pull over\nstudent: Pull out' wow this is a very difficult phrasal verb...\nteacher: Yeah...! So 'out' is into traffic/ 'in' is like we pulled in at the servcie station or whatever and pull over is when you stop by the side of the road!\nteacher: But all really common\nstudent: OK, thank you. I'll write them down\nteacher: OK ...you're happy with e.g. 'I got my car fixed' right - I'm sure you know it ....\nstudent: So 'pull in' means that you stop somewhere??\nteacher: Yes - at  a place I guess ..but confusingly...it can also be used for the same as pull over actually sorry! or 'had my car fixed'  = the same\nstudent: Sure, 'I got my car fixed' I guess I use 'to get' because I don't fix it myself??\nteacher: Yes that's right - seems like a small thing and you do hear people say 'I fixed the car' but this structure with get more normal....as in I had/got my hair cut much more common than I cut my hair yes\nstudent: I understand!\nstudent: understand\nteacher: OK - Emily sorry for the stupid question but...are there motorways in the CAnary ISlands ?\nstudent: haha it is not a stupid question. Yes there are motorways. What a coincidence, yesterday I had a conversation about it. We talked about how long we have had them\nteacher: Right...so how long would it take to drive around Tenerife?\nstudent: I know it isn't right but I don't know how to say that... can you say that the motorway is 50 years old?? I don't think so\nteacher: No that's fine! Are you worried because it's a thing? no it's normal...or fo course 'we've had motoways for 50 years\nstudent: I'm not sure how long it would take but I think it wouldn't take more than 4 hours\nteacher: or it was built 50 years a go or whatever\nteacher: OK 4 hours - well in fact you can drive quite a lot of the length of England in that tie\nteacher: time\nstudent: Thank you!! yes, I didn't know if you could use 'years old' for things...\nteacher: did you ever drive in the UK?\nteacher: OK yes! e.g. these shoes are a year old/my house is 80 years old etc etc\nstudent: Sorry, my laptop ran out of battery but I'm back\nteacher: OK great!\nteacher: Sorry did you ever drive in the UK?\nstudent: Good examples (shoes and house)\nstudent: About driving in the UK\nstudent: Yes, I rented a car for a month one of the winters I spent there\nteacher: OK right..you can guess my next question! Was it OK driving on the left?\nteacher: I mean the correct side\nstudent: I hated the cold so much that I thought that having a car I would enjoy my life more, but it wasn't really like that\nteacher: Oh no! That sounds like another  depressing story about miserable, grey England...\nteacher: and cold\nstudent: It was tricky, but having a bike since I moved there helped me a lot.\nteacher: Yes bikes are great in some places here\nstudent: hahah yes, depressing long grey winters...\nteacher: aahh stop\nstudent: hahah\nstudent: Is it grey today??\nteacher: ACtually right now it's sunny!!!!\nteacher: Give it 30 years it'll be a paradies\nstudent: Fantastic!! Leave the laptop and go out :)\nteacher: paradise\nteacher: Yes OK thanks Emily - I'll say goodbye - Il email you after this about another lesson OK? Thanks...\nstudent: I got a bit crazy about the sun when I lived there and even after. I couldn't be indoors when it was sunny\nteacher: I can imagine if you're used to that kind  of weather....OK bye\nstudent: Bye bye\nstudent: Thank you very much",
    "teacher: Hi there Alexis, all OK?\nstudent: Hi Ms. Rodriguez, how are you?\nteacher: Yeah I'm good thanks, just been for a run!\nstudent: That's a great way to start the day. I also did some exercise this morning\nstudent: I have done, I guess\nteacher: Yeah? what did you do? I'll come back on the have done or did in a bit\nteacher: It is more common overall to use the present perfect for e.g. this morning if it hasn\u2019t finished yet but\u2026it\u2019s by no means a rule and e.g.  did is perfectly fine especially if you\u2019re focusing on the action itself\nteacher: tell me about your exercise if you like!\nstudent: I try to do something every morning. This morning I went for a walk and afterwards I did some yoga at home. I'd love to run but I can't. I have something like arthrosis, so if I push myself too much I get pain everywhere...\nteacher: OK I see ...too bad about the running...but yoga is good I guess...do you find it's good mentally too? I've never really done it to be honest ...I'm too impatient I think!\nstudent: I understand. I thought the same before I did it for the first time. It is actually very hard, people tend to think that it is about relaxing and doing nothing, but I think it is very good for your body. It is difficult to explain but the first time I went to a class I realised that if I didn't do this kind of exercises (stretching exercises mainly) I wouldn't be able to do my shoes in 10 years haha\nstudent: stretching\nteacher: Yes I realise it's not easy really! I can see it's really good for you particularly for as you get older(!)  - actually I do lots of runnign so I do have to do a lot of e.g. core exercises and stuff some of which aren't dissimilar to yoga...\nstudent: What does 'dissimilar' mean??\nteacher: not similar to ...so not dissimilar means...similar!\nstudent: OK, thanks\nteacher: it's  bit of a complicated way of putting it i guess but common for educated speakers like me...(!)\nstudent: I think running and yoga is a very good combination. An d when I say yoga I mean exercises that help you to stretch all your muscles\nteacher: Yes I'm sure you're right...I have thought about doing yoga before so who knows? But i'm supposed to be doing kung fu with my daughter after Christmas! By the way Alexis I noticed you've typed 'tent' a couple of time for the verb 'tend' - is that just a typo??!\nteacher: Do you know what i mean by'typo' (=a typing error)\nstudent: Kung fu?? That sounds fun!\nteacher: Yeah well my daughter started doing it and has really got into it so I thought I'd try do some extra with her - so I can defend myself against her!\nstudent: Oh no, it's a mistake. I thought the verb was \\to tent\\\", I`ll correct it thanks\"\nteacher: OK sure - She hit me with her elbow the other day and it really hurt even though she's only 9\nstudent: haha did she hit you by accident??\nteacher: No! we were play fighting - but she takes it quite seriously hahah the tricky thing is as a parent i feel like I have to lose you know? but..at the same time I have to try to get her to cope with failure!\nstudent: Sure, I guess that is a difficult situation as a parent. I believe that it's not very helpful for children when parents let them win all the time but I'm not a mum\nteacher: No I think you're right - I guess kids with siblings learn the hard way but for only children I think they need to lose sometimes....did you play any sport in the past? Compettive I mean\nteacher: competitive!\nteacher: learn the hard way = learn through bad experiences in case you weren't sure by the way\nstudent: No, I've never played any team sports (I don't know how to say that)\nteacher: you can say 'as part of a team' or 'in a team' or 'team sport'  - all with the verb play\nstudent: great\nteacher: but not 'as a team' just for yourself!\nstudent: I understand\nteacher: I sed to play a lot of football but then 'retired' cos of injuries and now I just run but actually I've really got into it and run races etc\nteacher: used to play\nstudent: I wish I had but I wasn't interested in team sports when I was younger\nteacher: yeah some kids just don't - for different reasons I guess\nstudent: Running is very popular in Spain at the moment\nteacher: Yeah? in the UK too I'd say....there are lots of 'park runs' everywhere every Saturday and people just turn up and do a 5k - I go to the athletics club so a bit more than average....\nstudent: I think it's great! I can see many more people exercising on the streets nowadays than a few years ago\nteacher: Yes, you know one thing that I think about with running and Spain is that it  must be really hot for some of the year - as in too hot to run(?)\nteacher: When I lived there I didn't do much exercise - just smoked and drank too much!\nteacher: I gave up smoking a long time ago by the way thank god...\nstudent: Yes, I think you are right. I'm not sure if runners keep running in the summertime... I don't know if you know that in the Canary Islands it is generally 22 degrees all year round (is it correct?), so we don't have that problem\nteacher: oh yes of course I forgot about that ...perfect! you can say: 'all year round'\nteacher: without 'the'\nstudent: Haha, I see that your experience in Spain wasn't too healthy but I guess it was very fun\nstudent: Thanks for the corrections\nteacher: it was fun yeah! nice food cheap fags and booze so at the time I loved it!\nstudent: Fags and booze?? I don't know these words\nteacher: Yeah I guessed you might not - I Sued them deliberately sorry...they're informal ways of saying cigarettes and alcohol (in that order)!\nstudent: How long did you live in Spain? (do I need to add 'for' at the end of the question?)\nstudent: haha fun words\nteacher: no you don't need to add 'for' I was there for 3 years (with a 12-month break in the middle in France)\nstudent: Wow 3 years is a lot\nteacher: by the way the fags one is more lower class than the booze one I'd say...\nstudent: Did you teach English at that time?\nteacher: yes I was still teaching\nteacher: it was 20 years or so ago now\nstudent: I just looked up the word 'fag' in the dictionary and the first meaning is 'gay in an offensive way' (I didn't know that meaning either). The second meaning is cigarettes.\nteacher: yes that's true! when we say them it doesn't make us think of the other meaning usually! I'd say 'fag' for 'gay' (and yes it's an insult) is more American than British\nstudent: I'm not sure about how to use 'look up'... Can I say 'I looked up 'fag' in the dictionary...'??\nteacher: yes you were right! it was correct\nstudent: OK thanks\nteacher: what else would you say?\nstudent: With 'look up'??\nteacher: yes\nstudent: I looked up at the sky and I saw...??\nteacher: oh, yes of course ....No I meant for the meaning of look up something in the dictionary etc...but it's ok - that's exactly the phrasal verb you need - I just wanted to check you weren't using something else that was wrong sometimes\nstudent: Ahh I see\nstudent: I checked the word in the dictionary ??\nteacher: Yes that's fine too - would you say 'search'\nteacher: ?\nstudent: not sure. I don't say it but I don't know if it is right\nstudent: I search on the Internet\nteacher: no that's good - just wanted to check - lots of non-natives use 'search' a lot now because of the internet of course  - it's fine for that but they use it too much for other things you see - look up and check = perfect\nstudent: OK\nteacher: by the way do you use the internet much to keep up your English? e.g. youtube ..or Netflix or something\nstudent: Yes, I try to watch things in English. I listen to BBC radio podcasts, Ted talks, I watch series...\nstudent: My idea is to take the Cambridge Advanced exam in February so I have to work on it everyday... It's hard though\nstudent: +though\nteacher: yeah that's great - there's so much now right? I've really noticed the effect on the average level of my students, especially the younger ones - they've picked up so much from the internet etc  - that's great about CAE - it's good to have a set goal I guess...\nstudent: Yes, the Internet is great for that!\nteacher: Sorry small thing Alexis - earlier you said (I think) something like 'I also do a lot of exercise' - is there a difference in your mind between 'also' and e.g. too/as well'\nstudent: What do you mean by 'a difference in your mind'? Are you asking me if I know how to use them all??\nteacher: which one is more formal of the three?\nstudent: I don't know!!\nteacher: also' is more formal - to the extent that it's a little bit weird to hear: 'I also...' in everyday sepaking.\nteacher: it's not a big deal! and something shared by probably about 99.9% of non-native speakers to be honest.....\nstudent: Really?? To me it doesn't sound formal at all.\nteacher: it's more normal at the start of a sentence to introduce another point you see? LIke: I'm going because it's fun. Also, I want to see my friends etc\nstudent: I love learning this kind of things... I find it funny the way we understand a language when we study it.\nteacher: But the person answering wouldn't say: I also want to see my friends - they'd say (the native speaker!) : I want to see my friends too/as well...\nteacher: Yes there's loads of littel things\nteacher: little\nstudent: I understand, very interesting\nteacher: I'm sure you picked loads of authentic tuff from living in the UK\nteacher: well you have - I can see that\nteacher: picked up loads of stuff I meant!\nstudent: Sure!! By living there I realised how different learning a language at school in your own country is from learning in the country (ohh I don't know how to say this)\nstudent: how different is to learn...\nteacher: no that's fine! You were right the first time! OK thanks Alexis I guess we'll stop there - I'll email you in a bit OK?\nstudent: OK, thank your very much again\nstudent: Good bye!\nteacher: OK thanks a lot bye",
    "teacher: Hi Mia Johnson - I guess that really is you!\nstudent: Yes, I'm here... I noticed I can change my username!\nteacher: yes that's true - you can if you like...but you don't have to! How's it going? All ok with you?\nstudent: Yes, I'm fine. Thank you. I'm looking forward to my Christmas holiday!\nteacher: Ah of course! Are you staying in the uK?\nstudent: No, my husband and I decided to go to Mallorca.\nstudent: How about you?\nteacher: Well I'm going to spend a couple of weeks with my in-laws in the Lake District - do you know it?\nstudent: Lake District.. The place I admire!\nteacher: Yeah? You've been there there then?\nstudent: No, I've never been but I'd really love to go.\nstudent: It's famous in Japan as a hometown of Peter Rabbit.\nteacher: Yes, it's certainly very pretty - if you're lucky it's sunny (but cold) and clear - if not it just rains! Yes I get that about being famous in Japan - you see quite a few Japanese tourists there...\nstudent: I hope you will have many sunny days there!\nteacher: thank you! I also like it beacuse I'm really into running and it's a good opportunity to run on the hills you see\nstudent: Oh, you do some jogging! It must be great to run through beautiful place...\nstudent: Is there any place you like to run around in Cambridge?\nteacher: yes - running is a great way to get to know a place I find. Actually, that's also true for an urban area in fact. Um...I run all over the place to be honest...quite a lot by the river -\nteacher: or just out to different villages and back\nteacher: Have you been to many places around CAmbridge?\nstudent: A few weeks ago I ran around Grantchester, and I really liked that place!\nteacher: Oh right so you run too...yes, Grantchester is always a nice place to run...you can run by the river the other way but you have to run through the city a bit more first - it depends how far you want to go!\nteacher: Do you know the famous 'Orchard Tearoom' in Grantchester?\nstudent: Yes, I sometimes run but it's only for maintaining my weight. Do you run any farther than Grantchester?\nteacher: Well to be honest I'm a bit of a hard-core runner so yes I run a lot - at least 10k every day. Sometimes I run out to Ely for example...\nstudent: I saw Orchard Tearoom. It looked really good but I couldn't go because I was covered in mud..\nstudent: Wow... you are really into running! Ely is so far from here.\nteacher: Oh right! I see what you mean...well it's better int he summer/warmer weather anyway because you can sit outside. If you run a lot you get used it and it doesn't seem hard? Unless you try to run faster of course - that's what starts making the difference\nteacher: the ? was a mistake!\nteacher: get used to it I meant - sorry trying to type too fast!\nstudent: It's all right. I could understand what you mean.\nstudent: But sorry, I could not understand the meaning of your last sentence.\nteacher: Mia Johnson \u2013 have a look at these phrases (they are all possible in normal everyday speaking) \u2013 they have very different meanings, but they have a similar origin. Can you see where they come from?  1. take something on board 2. rock the boat 3. plain sailing  4. turn the corner 5. show your true colours 6. pass with flying colours 7. scrape the barrel  8. be (all) at sea\nstudent: They came from the navy, right?\nteacher: That's it! Well, from sailing anyway - 'nautical' expressions...but definitely common in normal speaking! Do you recognise any - or use them yourself?!\nstudent: I don't know any of them, but let me guess...\nteacher: ok\nstudent: 1. to start something\nstudent: 2. to stop someone from doing something\nstudent: 3. boring\nstudent: 4. an opportunity to change\nstudent: 5. to be honest\nstudent: 6. to boast\nstudent: 7. to prepare for something\nstudent: 8. something you are good at\nteacher: OK Mia Johnson, I'm really impressed with your willingness to just have a go! Some great guesses!- Let me give you a bit of help  - which ones means:  show what someone's real character is, especially when it is unpleasant\nteacher: you were pretty close with your guess on this one\nstudent: Sorry, I don't understand what you mean...\nteacher: sorry I meant 'which one means' - one of the phrases means: show what someone's real character is, especially when it is unpleasant\nstudent: which one means: show what someone's real character is, especially when it is unpleasant'\nstudent: You mean No.5?\nteacher: yes that's it! The 'colours' is from the colours on the flag the ship is flying, so if a ship was disguising itself to attack it would fly a false flag you see and then reveal it's true identity just before attacking\nteacher: but we use it to describe people - i.e. they pretend/seem to be nice and then do something horrible\nstudent: I see. It's interesting!\nteacher: OK let me make it quicker/easier - can you match these 4 with definitions? take something on board rock the boat plain sailing  turn the corner  (a situation) start to improve after a difficult period do or say something that will upset people or cause problems be easy and without problems  consider an idea, problem, or situation and try to deal with it\nteacher: Sorry hold on - let me do that again with gaps!\nteacher: 1. take something on board 2. rock the boat 3. plain sailing  4. turn the corner  a) (a situation) start to improve after a difficult period b) do or say something that will upset people or cause problems c) be easy and without problems d)  consider an idea, problem, or situation and try to deal with it\nteacher: OK? do your best!\nstudent: 1-d / 2-b / 3-c / 4-a\nteacher: Yes that's great well done! We'll come back to those  - let me give you the second group OK? Hold on a sec...\nstudent: \uff3c(^o^)\uff0f\nteacher: 5. show your true colours 6. pass with flying colours 7. scrape the barrel  8. be (all) at sea   e) use the worst people or things because that is all that is available  f) show what someone's real character is, especially when it is unpleasant g) complete something (e.g. an exam)  very successfully. h) be confused\nstudent: 5-f / 6-e / 7-h / 8-g\nstudent: I'm not sure...\nteacher: OK thanks....do you remember the 'pass with flying colours' from last week? That was you doing really well on the questions ('test) I gave you on articles. 'scrape the barrel' comes from when they kept food on a ship in barrels like meat and stuff adn when they were runnign out they had to scrape out the last (horrible' bits you see -does that help? .\nteacher: Sorry about my typing!\nstudent: Oh, I remembered... So 5-f / 6-g / 7-e / 8-h\nteacher: yes that's it great! OK Mia Johnson so I've thought of 4 situations I've been in - if you can try to use a phrase we've looked at to match with each situation  1. starting a new job  2. complaining about my salary 3. accepting criticism/negative feedback  4. starting running again after an operation  5. buying a new car for less than \u00a31500\nteacher: Sorry a bit complicated maybe to look back - i'll give you a minute ok?\nstudent: OK, I will try!\nstudent: OK, I will try!\nteacher: ok!\nstudent: 1: turn the corner\nstudent: 2: rock the boat\nteacher: Sorry is it easier with this list? 1. take something on board 2. rock the boat 3. plain sailing  4. turn the corner 5. show your true colours 6. pass with flying colours 7. scrape the barrel  8. be (all) at sea\nstudent: 3: scrape the barrel\nstudent: 4. turn the corner\nstudent: 5: scrape the barrel\nstudent: I'm not sure about 1, 2 and 3\nteacher: hanks Mia Johnson \u2013 so quite difficult with such  general examples/situations\u2026 but that\u2019s OK \u2013 good to think about! Give me a second\nteacher: So 'starting a new job' was that feeling when everything was a bit difficult at the beginning and I felt...'all at sea'!\nstudent: Hmmm... you mean you feel confused??\nteacher: Well yes - like you don't know how anything works or what you supposed to do - like you can't cope and feel 'out of your depth' (another phrase connected with being in the water!)'rock the boat' = perfect - people often say: Don't rock the boat - especially at work if you don't want to cause problems for yourself!\nteacher: confused isn't quite right often\nteacher: the negative feedback one is: 'take something on board' - in other words you accept/consider it (even if you don't like it exactly) - like picking up some one at sea if you see them drowning or something you see?\nteacher: 4 and 5 = perfect!\nstudent: Ah, I understand the nuance. That's because when you at the sea, you cannot see any way or landmark.\nteacher: yes I think that's right...to be honest I'm not sure exactly but that sounds convincing!\nteacher: good use of the word 'landmark' by the way!\nteacher: Listen Mia Johnson - we'll have to stop there - if you like you could prepare some examples of the phrases from today and show me next time ok?\nteacher: Try to think of some events/situations for yourself and have a g!\nteacher: a go!\nstudent: Thank you. OK, I see. Will I be able to see this chatroom after the online lesson?\nteacher: Um...no unfortunately! But I'll email you the phrases with definitions OK?\nstudent: Thank you so much. Have a nice day!\nteacher: OK thanks Mia Johnson bye!\nstudent: Bye",
    "student: Hi\nteacher: Hi Emily, how's it going - all OK?\nstudent: I'm fine, thank you\nstudent: You??\nteacher: OK great - listen, I heard about your IELTS exam by the way...\nstudent: Oh, I've forgotten to tell you\nstudent: My score was 6.5\nteacher: Do you mean: 'I forgot to tell you'?  yes tell me now - oh you just did OK\nteacher: 6.5 - that's great welldone! tell me more..\nstudent: Reading was 7, listening was 6.5, and the others were 6.\nteacher: OK cool - what were the writing questions about?\nstudent: Task 1 was about a bar chart, so it wasn't difficult, and task 2 was about relationships in a neiborhood.\nteacher: OK right...you mean 'with neighbours'?\nstudent: Both topics were usual ones, but I couldn't find enough synonyms.\nstudent: Oh, yeah I do\nteacher: OK - but it sounds like you must have done pretty well with your language\nteacher: Anyway, does that mean I won't see you in an IELTS class again?!\nstudent: At least, I think I managed to achieve the tasks.\nteacher: yes, you were always good at understanding the basic task, which is really important (and not as easy as it seems sometimes)..\nstudent: I'm leaving here in two weeks, and I'm taking private lessons until then.\nstudent: However, I'm thinking about doing a master's degree in the UK.\nteacher: Oh of course right - so yeah definitely no more IELTS! How are the classes at the moment? Oh wow! A master's degree here - I thought you'd be going back - you seemed a bit homesick....!\nstudent: They are good. I can speak English more than when I was in group lessons.\nteacher: Yes of course - I'm sure you're making faster progress - well if you stayed longer in England to do a masters's you'd definitely get more fluent right?!\nteacher: master's\nstudent: I need to go back and go to university for 1 year.\nteacher: Oh OK - so you'd have time to think about returning to the UK...I don't know...once you start eating that real Japanese food again...!\nteacher: OK Emily, can you use the structures below to complain about someone you know (tell the truth if possible\u2026)? My small example = My daughter\u2019s always leaving her clothes lying around on the floor \u2013 it drives me mad! (sorry I\u2019m old!) He\u2019s always\u2026..ing\u2026. \u2026.it really drives me mad/crazy \u2026.it does my head in (informal).\nteacher: Or..you could be one of your parents complaining about you in the past - you decide!\nstudent: Sorry, my network is not good today.\nteacher: no problem\nstudent: Please send me the messages again.\nteacher: OK Emily, can you use the structures below to complain about someone you know (tell the truth if possible\u2026)? My small example = My daughter\u2019s always leaving her clothes lying around on the floor \u2013 it drives me mad! (sorry I\u2019m old!) He\u2019s always\u2026..ing\u2026. \u2026.it really drives me mad/crazy \u2026.it does my head in (informal).\nteacher: OK?\nstudent: My sister's always wearing my clothes without telling me!!\nteacher: Ah OK - is that true?! OK so: my sister's always wearing my clothes without telling me. (you need the 'always' in there too) - and...how does that make you feel?\nstudent: It's okay if she keeps them clean...\nteacher: OK right - so you don't mind too much...as long as she keeps them clean! I get it! I forgot you had a sister - what's she doing again?\nstudent: She is starting university.\nstudent: going to university\nteacher: Oh right - so she's starting in MArch/April - that's the start of the academic year in Japan right? What's she going to study?\nstudent: From April!! And she is studying nutrition.\nteacher: OK right - that sounds like a degree with a job at the end of it! By the way, you'd say: 'she's starting university' (without 'go')\nteacher: Hey Emily, going back to the master\u2019s idea \u2013 do you have any idea where you might do it in the UK?\nstudent: I'm thinking about Edinburgh and Bristol\nteacher: Oh right, Edinburgh and Bristol - both quite cool cities i'd say - have you  been to either of them before?\nstudent: No, I've never been there.\nteacher: Well like I say both a bit cooler than Cambridge! And bigger too - I guess that's partly why...Emily \u2013 back to complaining - imagine your parents \u2013 what do you think they would have said to complain about you in the past? (you have to imagine they spoke English for this obviously!). Give me an example\u2026.the problem and how they felt if you can\u2026\nstudent: My parents would have said I wasn't good at cleaning my room.\nteacher: OK right - a common parental complaint! Can you try saying that and using the structures from earlier?\nteacher: Begin with: He...\nteacher: He's always...\nstudent: He is always leaving his room in a mess\nteacher: OK great! Yes that's good...so 'He's always leaving his room in a mess' is good\nteacher: and how did they feel about it...?\nstudent: They thought it was because I had a mental illness, haha\nteacher: Oh god - I don't know if you're serious! 'They thought I might have a mental illness/be mentally ill' is good - No i think it means you were a perfectly normal teenager right?!\nstudent: Yes, at least I think so, haha\nteacher: I think so! Any more complaints from you? About..I don't know...classmates (you don't have to use names!)\nteacher: Or people in your accommodation\nstudent: She is always trying to win against me. It is really annoying.\nteacher: THanks - 'annoying' = good word here! do you mean like in a game?\nstudent: No, I mean at IELTS practice.\nteacher: Ok I see - you mean get a higher score!\nstudent: Yes, I do.\nteacher: Emily \u2013 just to practise this quickly \u2013 can you think of a way (or more than one if possible) :Liverpool 1 - Barcelona 0\nteacher: sorry - of describing that score I gave you\nteacher: in a sentence\nstudent: Liverpool won against Barcelona 1-0.\nteacher: can you delete one word to make it correct?\nstudent: against??\nteacher: no try again!\nstudent: for??\nstudent: for??\nteacher: Yes that's it!\nstudent: I didn't know that.\nteacher: OK so your sentience is possible/good  -can you try another sentence with the word 'beat' for the same score\nstudent: Barcelona was beaten by Liverpool 1-0.\nteacher: OK great! Or: Liverpool beat Barcelona 1-0 ('one nil' remember in speaking!) - also we normally say 'were' for a football team in speaking\nteacher: and 'they' you see\nstudent: Ah, because they are a team, right??\nteacher: Yes that's it - you can use the singular too though especailly more formally (or imagine like thinking about the club as a company or whatever - definitely in that situation) So Emily - because you're IELTS example is not exactly like a knockout competiition you could say she's always trying to beat me  (as in my score) but not really win against me -\nteacher: OK?!\nstudent: Yes, that's what I mean. Even though IELTS isn't a competiton...\nteacher: OK - you mean you still want to say 'win' - OK you can, you can - it's possible!\nteacher: to really emphasis she though of it like a compettiion I guess!\nteacher: thought\nteacher: OK Emily - we'll have to stop there - thanks a lot- speak to you soon\nstudent: Yeah, I think so.\nteacher: cheers!\nstudent: Okay",
    "teacher: Hi Amelia Smith., is that you?!\nstudent: Hi Mrs. Williams\nstudent: How are you?\nteacher: Yeah I'm good thanks - all OK with you?\nstudent: I'm fine, getting a cold though...\nteacher: Oh no! Sorry to hear that - hopefully it'll only be a minor one....did you know it's common too to say: 'I'm coming down with a cold'?\nstudent: ahh thanks, I've heard it before...\nteacher: OK! Well, it's general election day today in the UK...\nstudent: uhhh are you excited about it?? or worried?\nstudent: Have you voted yet?\nteacher: Um...I wouldn't say excited exactly...it's hard to say to be honest. The odds are that the Conservatives will win which means (probably!) that Brexit will go ahead in a stronger form..\nteacher: I haven't voted no...\nstudent: I understand... let's see what happens\nteacher: yes...good luck in the EU...\nteacher: I guess there's not much anti-EU feeling in Spain overall right?\nstudent: what do you mean?\nteacher: I mean we'll be out of it - for better or worse\nstudent: I hope not (is it correct??)\nteacher: You mean; 'I hope not' ( in relation to anti-EU feeling in Spain? )\nstudent: Yes, that is what I wanted to say\nstudent: Nooo\nteacher: ?\nstudent: Sorry, I meant that I hope the UK stays in the EU\nteacher: Oh yes of course - I've just realised that you probably mean that....hold on a sec\nteacher: Both outcomes have definitely been possible over the last few years slightly incredibly but now it does look like we'll almost certainly leave in some fashio...\nteacher: it's just a question of how and when probably\nstudent: And about Spain, I don't think there is much anti-EU feeling. People in Catalonia have their fight but it's about Spain not about the EU so far...\nteacher: Yes I see what you mean....the whole Brexit thing has made Scottish independence a big thing again you know...beacuse Scotland voted to stay in the EU you see\nstudent: I understand... I'm not very interested in politics so I don't follow the news. I get bored, here it's crazy, we have had so many elections recently and we still don't have a president...\nteacher: Right...yes I saw something about that....Amelia Smith. do you know I live on a boat?\nstudent: Really?? Please, tell me about it\nstudent: Where, on the River Cam??\nteacher: Well, it's a narrowboat - do you know what i mean? Built for canals really, so long but very narrow...like a train carriage!.\nteacher: Yes in the river\nteacher: I mean 'on' the river!!!!\nstudent: I've always been very curious about how people live in those boats you see when walking down the river...\nteacher: I live in the middle of nowhere which suits me - I wouldn't like to live in CAmbridge on one\nteacher: because people walk right past you see - when their drunk etc\nstudent: Do you always use 'on' when you speak about a river?\nteacher: yes...unless you actually mean underwater i guess\nteacher: hold on...no something floating like rubbish or something then 'in' is good\nstudent: For example 'I swim in or on the river?\nteacher: and swim' in' yes - I guess you'r e kind of in it you see - not floating on top\nstudent: ahhhh I see\nteacher: it's the same with on the bus or in the bus - if you say 'in' it's like really focusing on the interior space you see\nteacher: ...so 'on' is much more common\nstudent: So you live in the middle of nowhere near Cambridge?? You need a car to get to your boat? Can you use the boat to travel?\nteacher: for buses/trains etc\nteacher: well I could drive my boat into CAmbridge but it takes a long time - they're very slow\nteacher: so i drive/get the train/run(!) or whatever\nstudent: I kind of understand the different uses of in and on but it is very confusing for me considering that in Spanish there is only one word for both of them...\nteacher: also there's a lock between where I live and Cambridge - do you know what I mean? - yes I undersrtand about on and in - sorry!\nteacher: It's like e.g. por and para for me in Spanish you know\nstudent: Yes, I know what a lock is but I don't know what they are for... Here there are no rivers so I'm quite ignorant about the topic\nstudent: Yes, por and para are very hard to get and even hard for me to explain when I teach Spanish...\nteacher: Sorry for delay...anyway so I like my boat - mainly because it's really cheap compared to a house you know!\nteacher: it's pretty basic though - not for everyone\nstudent: I don't know about boat prices but I've heard a lot about how expensive it is to buy and rent a house in Cambridge\nstudent: And is it big enough for a family?\nteacher: yes it really is unaffordable for people on an average income now... it's one of the biggest social issues right now in the UK\nteacher: Well it depends what you mean by 'enough'! But we're happy!\nteacher: At least my daughter is for now - maybe in a couple of years she might decide she hates it!\nteacher: and then we'll have to give in probably and move into a house\nstudent: I get so angry when I hear these kinds of things... The same here in Madrid, Barcelona, Mallorca, San Sebastian... If you are lucky and don't have to live in these cities, it's good, but if you need to be there for whatever reason, more than half of your salary goes to pay the rent\nstudent: *Those cities\nteacher: yes it's really bad I know - it should be a basic right - I'm surprised sometimes there isn't more of a reaction to it to be honest - but this is politics Amelia Smith.! You're not that interested remember!!\nteacher: what about the CAnaries?\nteacher: I mean housing\nstudent: hahaha you are right (about me not being interested in politics)\nstudent: Well, here it's definitely cheaper than there\nstudent: Rents are affordable. Buying a house is more expensive though\nteacher: yes I imagined - i guess anywhere there are fewer jobs the housing is cheaper basically\nteacher: yes I realise now I'll probably never buy a house..but I've stopped caring!\nstudent: The problem we are having now is that people from the island are finding it very hard to find a permanent rented flat in tourist areas because the owners rent their houses for holidays (Airbnb and so on)\nstudent: permanent rented flat' I'm sure it's wrong...\nteacher: you know Amelia Smith. that traditionally English people left home pretty young compared to some countries (I was 16 for example)  - but the rise in housing has changed that - yes I understand about AirBnB etc yes you can say a long-term rent\nteacher: not what you said!\nteacher: but it was understandable of course\nstudent: wow, you left when you were 16?? So young...\nteacher: by the way Amelia Smith. a couple of small things: you should say 'tourist areas' ...also before when you said 'topic': it's not wrong but 'subject' is much more normal\nstudent: Here I have friends who are 35 years old and still living with their parents...\nteacher: yes that used to be really unusual in the UK (as in weird) but not so much now!\nstudent: Thank you for the corrections!\nteacher: OK - by the way if you want to say 'tourist' in a negative way you can sya 'touristy' as an adjective ( informal but common)\nteacher: so 'it's a bit touristy' (as in too much)\nstudent: I see\nteacher: I was talking to a student the other day about phrases and one came up connected to saiing and I was reminded of how many phrases there are in English with this origin - hold on\nteacher: have a look at these - are you familiar with them?1. take something on board 2. rock the boat 3. plain sailing  4. turn the corner\nstudent: I only know the meaning of the first one\nteacher: right OK - I'll give you definitions - see if you can match them up ok? hold on\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: a) (a situation) start to improve after a difficult period b) do or say something that will upset people or cause problems c) be easy and without problems d)  consider an idea, problem, or situation and try to deal with it\nstudent: 1 d\nteacher: yep\nstudent: Maybe 2 b\nteacher: that's it!\nstudent: 3c\nteacher: yep\nstudent: 4d ;)\nstudent: That's interesting! Are these idioms?\nteacher: yes they are - but they're very common ones you know\nstudent: 4 a sorry\nteacher: apparently 'turn the corner' comes from when ships went round the cape of good hope of Cape Horn and then the route was easy you seee\nteacher: yes 4a!\nteacher: or CApe Horn\nteacher: Can I give you 4 more?\nstudent: Yes!!\nteacher: 5. show your true colours 6. pass with flying colours 7. scrape the barrel  8. (all) at sea\nteacher: familiar?\nstudent: not at all\nteacher: OK ...what do you think? e) use the worst people or things because that is all that is available  f) show what someone's real character is, especially when it is unpleasant g) complete something (e.g. an exam)  very successfully. h) be confused\nstudent: 5 f\nteacher: sure\nstudent: 6g\nteacher: yes\nstudent: no idea about 7 and 8\nstudent: I don't know the meaning of the words in number 7 :(\nteacher: well, you know that ships had barrels with e.g. meat stored in them - so if there was only a bit left they had no choice but to scrape out the last horrible bit you see\nstudent: I see\nstudent: e for the barrel??\nteacher: sorry you know 'barrel' like round made of wood right?\nteacher: yes e!\nstudent: Can you use 'at sea' in a sentence, please?\nteacher: Yes of course - so it's like you don't know what to do or you can't cope - like: I was all at sea in my new job on the first day\nteacher: it reminds me of e.g. to be out of your depth (another watery phrase!) - you know that one?\nstudent: I understand, I like it!\nteacher: Yes they definitely give a bit of colour to your language!\nteacher: Some idioms less useful/common of course\nteacher: bu these are pretty normal!\nstudent: to be out of your depth; I would use it if I was running or something like that... Does it have a different meaning??\nteacher: i.e. did you ever actually hear anyone say: 'It's raining cats and dogs'?! ah so 'out of your depth' is when you can't touch the bottom if you're swimming so metaphorically it's like you can't cope/something's too difficult\nteacher: very common\nteacher: again, e.g. for a job\nstudent: I see\nteacher: or sport if you can imagine a weaker player/team against a stronger one\nstudent: I've heard the one about the rain\nteacher: yes but I meant native speakers don't actually really say ti (or maybe they did to you?!)\nteacher: it's like an idiom from an idiom book\nstudent: I find it very funny because I actually imagine cats and dogs coming down from the sky hehe crazy, I know\nteacher: yes I don't know where it comes from to be honest!\nteacher: OK Amelia Smith. - so I guess we'll stop there - I'll email you OK? THanks\nstudent: OK, thank you again\nteacher: OK no problem take care...\nstudent: you too, have a good afternoon!",
    "teacher: Hi Emily Smith?\nstudent: Hi\nstudent: How are you?\nteacher: I'm good thanks - all OK with you?\nstudent: Yes, I'm very well too\nteacher: How was your Christmas?\nstudent: Uff, it seems very far away now... haha\nteacher: really? Are you back to being busy then?\nstudent: But I had a good time\nstudent: How about you? Did you enjoy the break? (or your break)\nteacher: Yes I did thanks - I spent a couple of weeks in the LAke District - do you know it?\nstudent: This week I have started a full time course, very intense. In addition I'm taking some private lessons and I'm also teaching a few hours at home. So at the moment I'm very busy... Hopefully I'll get used to it soon\nteacher: Oh right - can I ask what kind of course it is?\nstudent: Ohh the Lake District! It's so beautiful, I went camping there almost 10 years ago\nteacher: Yes it's nice isn't it - a good time to go - well I like it in winter anyway - not quite so busy and if the weather's not really bad it;s fine\nteacher: but I can't camp because I live on a boat so it's kind of semi-camping all the time so for holidays I need something more!\nstudent: Sure. It's a teacher training course. It's a qualification you need in Spain to teach adults if you want to work for a Spanish job center\nteacher: OK I see - yes  I remember  you mentioned  that line of work before\nteacher: is it challenging working with 'jobseekers' as we have to call them in England\nstudent: Talking about the Lake District... I remember the day we went it was very hot in Cambridge (I guess it was in the summer) and up there it was quite cold, especially at night time\nteacher: yeah - it's generally a few degrees colder up there - and much wetter too\nteacher: Now i remember you really like hot weather and the sun etc!\nteacher: I'm not so bothered to be honest\nstudent: And where did you stay if you didn't camp?\nteacher: I kind of like the temperate climate not really hot or cold\nteacher: We were lucky and stayed in a house belonging to friends of my in-laws - a nice one - so it felt pretty luxurious for us!\nteacher: while they were away abroad\nstudent: ohh great, that was lucky!!\nteacher: yes - we had an island in the kitchen - do you know what i mean?\nstudent: Yes, I love the idea!\nteacher: and thousands of kitchen utensils - this is the kind of thing you get excited about after 12 years on a boat! superficial i know\nstudent: I've only seen them on TV\nteacher: hairdryers....\nteacher: you mean islands? ha ha well i guess they're common in bigger houses right?\nstudent: Hahah I totally understand. I remember feeling something similar after living in big dorms in different hostels in Sicily for 3 months... I was so excited when I had an opportunity to have a nice shower in a friend's house, hehe. She got very worried...\nteacher: yes you need a few home comforts I guess\nteacher: Emily Smith - are you still planning to do CAE soon?\nstudent: I do need some comforts, I guess we are all different about these things. Don't you think?\nteacher: sure -to be honest i'm pretty minimalist actually - I genuinely like having a very limited set of possessions\nteacher: not because I'm virtuous just because I've always been like that\nstudent: About CAE, my idea is to take it in April\nteacher: OK great - are you planning to do much preparation for it?\nstudent: What do you mean when you say 'always'? Didn't you grow up in a house?: Maybe it's an inappropriate question, if you don't feel like sharing I understand. Just curious\nteacher: no no that's fine - well maybe not as a young kid excatly (in a house yes!) but as older teenager/adult I guess I've moved about a bit and been more of a 'mental' person you know - rather than an object person (not very articulate way of describing in English I'm afraid\nstudent: I need a lot of preparation. At the moment I'm taking lessons (1 hour a week, I can't afford more) and I have some books... I should spend more time studying; however, after the course I'm too tired.\nstudent: I see what you mean. That's very good!\nteacher: OK right - well if you like you can ask me for any help/use this time to practise new language etc\nstudent: Thank you, I don't even know what to ask haha\nstudent: I think just writing here helps me. Before these 'classes' I was much more scared of writing in English\nteacher: ha! well I guess the general principle is that you can do a lot of self-study (as your an intelligent learner I'm sure!) and then (this si the key) you can do feer practice of new language to consolidate/integrate it into your productive skills (speaking and writing)\nteacher: I mean practise it by consciously using it with me\nteacher: freer practice\nstudent: I understand. That's really hard for me (using new knowledge I mean)\nstudent: freer?? I\nteacher: more free\nstudent: ahh\nteacher: as in not just an exercise but in 'real' communication\nteacher: more or less!\nstudent: I should do that\nteacher: yes don't worry - using new stuff is always tricky - you need to 'meet' it lots of times before you;re likely to use it\nteacher: but you can speed it up a bit by artificially focusing on it - but again it's much more effective if it's in some form of realistic communication\nstudent: I see. Do you do exam preparation?\nstudent: sorry, do you do or teach?\nteacher: yes I do/teach exam classes\nteacher: both are fine\nstudent: ok\nteacher: lots of IELTS recently but the other Cambridge exams too\nteacher: did you do First CErtificate?\nstudent: So you know what I am supposed to know. I mean maybe we could practise vocabulary that is used in CAE... I don't know, just an idea\nstudent: No, I've never taken an English exam\nteacher: yes of course - that's fine and yes a good idea for you - do you have books?\nstudent: Yes I have two books with tests\nteacher: OK great - have you got them with you now?!\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: Why don't you just choose a page/unit with some vocab and quickly write down now 5 words/pieces of language that are a bit more challenging for you/you don't use\nteacher: keywords they focus on in that page i mean\nstudent: OK, I'll do it now\nteacher: ok\nstudent: ...provocative, and supplied +startling+ messages about psychology...\nstudent: Is this piece of text enough to work on? The word I don't know is startling\nteacher: ok thanks....'startling' does it mean: obvoius or surprising do you think? is there a context in the text to help you?\nteacher: obvious\nstudent: I think it means surprising\nteacher: yes you're right! the verb is 'startle'\nteacher: a bit formal\nteacher: but not much!\nstudent: I see\nteacher: can you give me an example of a celebrity that is provocative\nteacher: ?\nstudent: Do you recommend that I try to learn all the new vocab I find in a reading text?\nstudent: Donald Trump (not a celebrity though)\nteacher: Um..that's a difficult question! I guess that the considerations are e.g. frequency - so higher frequency items are generally more useful of course. The trouble is of course that it's difficult for you to know that sometimes (which is why teachers are useful!) - maybe not ALL the words no - I guess sometimes you can get a feel for how useful a word is i.e. if you can see it's restricted to a very specific topic\nteacher: Trump = good example! give me a specific example if you can of his behaviour/statements using 'provocative'/'provoke'\nstudent: OK, I understand\nteacher: or general ...but something!\nteacher: specific is often good because it's more memorable I'd say - also you can discover the way that target language collocates with certain other words or not more effectively with specific examples\nstudent: I don't know what to say about Trump\nstudent: I found something online 'I have a great relationship with the blacks'\nteacher: ha! not an easy subject to face maybe! well how about: 'Trump likes to provoke his liberal opponents by using deliberately offensive language - a bit bland really but just a basic examples\nteacher: example\nstudent: ok\nteacher: what else could be provocative?\nstudent: His comments about immigrants are very provocative\nteacher: sorry just noticed your example earlier! and immigration sure ...I guess 'controversial' is more common generally and fine for both of these too\nteacher: provocative sounds deliberate right? And of course Trump may well have made these remarks deliberately of course\nteacher: you can see that on the news they would probably say 'controversiual' because they would n't want to say that any offence was intentional\nstudent: I understand your correction. In Spanish we have both words (controvertido y provocativo) and I see that controversial is more appropriate\nteacher: controversial\nteacher: Emily Smith - can I recommend a language corpus website? if you put 'bnc byu corpus' in google then you should get it - put a keyword in the search box and it'll give you loads of examples - a bit messy and some difficult stuff BUT might be interesting for you - it'll give you a snapshot of the word in real use\nteacher: like a dictionary but better!\nteacher: you'll get a quick idea of collocations/contexts/nuance etc\nstudent: Oh great, thank you\nstudent: It sounds very good, I'll have a look later\nteacher: OK great try it and let me know if it works next time (and if it's useful)\nteacher: Ok right that's it I guess thanks\nstudent: Yes, the hour went very quickly today\nstudent: Thank you and speak again tomorrow\nteacher: Oh listen Emily Smith - if you like email me the books you have and tell me a page number you might look at!\nteacher: I can think about some follow up work we can do you see\nteacher: if i have the books - Imight\nstudent: Great, I will\nteacher: ok speak to you tomorrow!",
    "teacher: Hi Alice Johnson, happy new year! How are you?\nstudent: Happy new year! Good, thank you.\nteacher: Great - how was your Christmas - did you stay in Cambridge?\nstudent: No, we went to the island of Mallorca... It was very warm and sunny!\nstudent: How was your trip to the Lake District?\nteacher: Oh right yes - I remember now you said  you were going away! What did you think of Mallorca?\nstudent: There were beautiful beaches and I felt really relaxed as few people were there.\nteacher: right that sounds lovely I spent a few years living in Spain and I do miss it sometimes!\nstudent: Oh really! Was it for your work?\nteacher: well yes basically - I just taught in different schools\nstudent: Then you must miss the sunshine during the winter.\nteacher: Yeah I do miss the sun! Alice Johnson: 'few people' = formal or normal?\nstudent: I thought it's normal... but formal?\nteacher: A bit yes....can you tell me the thing you said about MAllorca in a different way?\nteacher: the thing about few people i mean\nstudent: Not many people were there...\nstudent: But it sounds different.\nteacher: in meaning you mean? it's OK - it has the same meaning (but sounds different yes because it's less formal!)\nteacher: Look, this is what I had already written to reply to your earlier question!: Yes the Lake District was lovely \u2013 not warm and sunny! \u2013 but the weather wasn\u2019t too bad. There aren\u2019t quite so many people in winter either so it\u2019s a bit more peaceful you know? #\nstudent: Hmm... I thought 'few people' means that we rarely see people.\nteacher: by the way, 'there weren't many people' is a more common order than 'not many people were there'\nteacher: um...'few' by itself doesn't give information about frequency\nteacher: how can you say the opposite? i.e. in winter there aren't many people but in summer...\nstudent: I see. It sounds like 'few' is fewer than 'not many', but it's the same, right?\nstudent: In summer there are many people.\nteacher: ah yes of course I see what you mean - yes it is a bit confusing i guess but yes you're absolutely right\nteacher: many people' = formal or normal\nstudent: Normal\nteacher: well....a bit formal to be honest! can you think of another way of saying it?\nstudent: Oh, really! In summer, there were a lot of people.\nstudent: were \u27a1\ufe0eare\nteacher: yeah that's it! Just to be clear: few and many are perfectly correct and fine but...you will hear people use (not) many  and lots\nteacher: much more often I mean\nteacher: in normal speaking\nstudent: I see. So these words sound more natural, right?\nstudent: I mean in daily conversation.\nteacher: yes exactly - in most normal situations (for most people!)\nteacher: next time you speak to someone (a native speaker) you'll notice if you think about it!\nstudent: Thank you for telling me. That's very helpful.\nteacher: no problem - Quick practice Alice Johnson: tell me about somewhere you've been in the UK with large and small numbers of people\nstudent: Large number: London, Oxford, Cambridge\nteacher: OK i mean with the words we've just focused on!\nstudent: Sorry ^^;\nteacher: that' ok ha ha\nstudent: There are lots of people in London\nstudent: while there are not many people in Corby.\nteacher: ok fine and good for the negative form (you contrct in speech right (aren't)? - 'lots' is fine - a different  word?\nteacher: contract\nstudent: a lot of\nstudent: But didn't you say 'lots' is used more often?\nteacher: also correct (no difference) ...what about 'loads'? Do you use this word?\nstudent: I've never heard 'loads'...\nteacher: Really? OK, it's really common seriously - I bet you'll notice it now I've mentioned it!\nstudent: Oh,Thank you.\nteacher: it's common in normal informal speech - also can be quite emphatic as in lots and lots!\nstudent: So is it used like 'There are loads of people in London'\nstudent: ?\nteacher: Yeah absolutely... or e.g. I went to the swimming pool - there were loads of peopel because it's the school holidays...OK Alice Johnson one more! - 'rarely' = formal or normal?\nteacher: people\nteacher: of course e.g. 'crowded' is common too\nstudent: I think it's normal.\nteacher: ok...it's certainly perfectly possible and correct...can you think of a different word?!\nstudent: seldom?\nteacher: good idea! So in order of formality: seldom, rarely and hardly ever\nteacher: you've heard that before?\nstudent: So you mean hardly is the most casual? I know these words, but I've never thought about the order of formality.\nteacher: yes ' hardly ever' (two words together) is by far the most common in normal speaking. Just to clarify: 'seldom' = correct but very formal i.e. many English people will never have said it in their lives!\nstudent: Hardly + ever', I see... He hardly ever  comes to school on time. Like that?\nteacher: Yep perfect example - and by far the most common form you would hear in everyday life - Quick pronunciation question Alice Johnson: can you imagine the difference in sound between the words 'aunt' as in opposite of uncle and 'aren't' (are not)\nstudent: Yes, I can... Aren't has 'r' sound.\nteacher: For most British people?\nstudent: What do you mean? Do they sound the same in the UK?\nteacher: Yes exactly they sound exactly the same for me  so e.g. both are: /\u0251\u02d0nt/  sorry, do you understand the phonemic symbols?\nstudent: Oh, really!? Is that like a dialect? I can understand the phonemic symbols.\nteacher: But of course you can say them how you like Alice Johnson! (as in with an /r/ if you like - I'm just pointing it out for understanding! And Americans and many other English speakers do say it with an /r/ (but not generally in e.g. Cambridge - sorry just caught your last comment...that's funny! I like the idea of you telling English peopel who don't pronounce the /r/ that they're speaking a dialect! it's standard for most English people especially in the south and this is often regarded as having the neutral English accent - do you see?\nteacher: that's great you can read the symbols by the way - very useful\nteacher: now i can write more stuff!\nstudent: I see, in Japan there are a lot of dialects, but in the UK, there are many kinds of accents...\nteacher: Right I see. You know that 'dialect' suggests different grammar and vocabulary right? So in the UK there aren't really many different dialects left but yes 0 as you say - lots of different accents\nteacher: have you noticed/heard any difference in accents in the UK\nstudent: Interesting. Hmm... My friend said 'scone' has two pronunciations, 'sco:n' and 'scoun'///\nstudent: I'm not sure if the symbols are correct\nteacher: ah  i see - a classic example! Yes good one! I guess that's just two ways of pronouncing the same word - more than an 'accent' thing you see? As in peopel who have basically the same accent might disagree about that particular word!\nteacher: and peopel who choose the same verision of that word might still have a different accent if you see what I mean?!\nteacher: version\nstudent: Sorry, I cannot understand. What is the difference?\nteacher: so if i say /sk\u0252n/ (and i do!) an e.g. Scottish person might say it that way too but i would still hear that they are SCottish\nteacher: and a person from the south of Egnland like me might say /sk\u0259\u028an/ (not like me) but i would still hear that they have the same accent as me in general\nteacher: sorry Alice Johnson - have i confused you more?!\nstudent: Oh, it's difficult for me to recognise the difference between the example of 'aren't' and 'scone' as I don't know the background!\nteacher: ok so the /r/ thing is a more useful distinction because it is a big general difference i.e. e.g. Americans normally have an /r/ and most English people don't BUT the 'scone' thing is just a word that everybody has arguments (joking) about the right way to say it i.e. it's not really an 'accent' or regional thing\nteacher: one more Alice Johnson - a really big accent thing: in the south of England we say /a:/  as in /b\u0251\u02d0\u03b8/ and in the north they say /\u00e6/\nstudent: I see. I got it. Ah, how about the word 'staff'? In American English it sounds like /staef/ but in the UK it sounds like /sta:f/\nteacher: ha! yes great ecample!!!!!!!!\nteacher: example\nteacher: the same as in America in the north of the UK but less nasal!\nstudent: That's interesting.\nstudent: Thank you for telling me a lot of things today.\nteacher: OK thanks a lot Alice Johnson (you see 'many thanks' much more formal!) I'll contact you soon about a further lesson ok?\nstudent: Yes, of course it's OK!\nteacher: a lot of things' = good!\nteacher: ok great bye\nstudent: Bye!",
    "teacher: Hello Liam Smith are you there?\nstudent: Hi\nstudent: Here I am ;)\nteacher: hi there! thanks for your email Liam Smith - I didn't open until just now to be honest sorry - I didn't check the right email folder! Tell me the book you have - is it number 1 or 2 ( ihave both in front of me)\nstudent: Great!\nstudent: Number 1 of the National Geografic one\nteacher: ok hold on a sec\nstudent: The other one is too old\nteacher: ok right - so if you turn to page 12 is there a test on a text 'nature's clocks' ?\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: ok great just checking we've got the same edition- that's great! so do you want to have a go now quickly ?!\nteacher: i.e. write down the eight answers you think are correct?\nstudent: I was about to suggest that we could work on the different meanings of words in this type of exercises (the one on page 12)\nteacher: ok fine....how about you give me an example sentence of 'wavers' is that OK?\nstudent: Do you want me to give you all the answers or shall we work on them one by one?\nteacher: um...ok let's try one by one and see how we go ok?\nstudent: ok\nstudent: 1c\nteacher: great yes keep going!\nstudent: 2d\nteacher: yep!\nstudent: 3a\nteacher: good...\nstudent: 4c\nteacher: yes\nstudent: 5d\nteacher: good\nstudent: haha I generally make mistakes!!!\nteacher: ha! well maybe i bring you luck..!\nstudent: 6b??\nteacher: yes i could see this might be trickier...but yes well done!\nstudent: or highly convinced?\nteacher: No!\nteacher: with collocations i'd say first instinct is usually best\nstudent: ok\nstudent: With which adjectives can we use 'highly'? Could you give me a few examples?\nteacher: sure ... well 'firmly' first e.g. opposed/committed = common with noun forms too\nstudent: By the way, I think the first question is wrong... Maybe 'which adj can be used with highly?\nteacher: well both possible... 'with which' and in general prepositions first = formal or normal?\nstudent: Ahh thanks, it didn't sound good to me.\nteacher: ok so...prepositions at the end though are also fine e.g. what are you scared of? ok? so..can you ask you're quesstion again with that structure\nstudent: Which adjectives can we use highly with?\nteacher: Highly = e.g. likely/qualified/recommended/intelligent\nteacher: sensitive/probable...\nstudent: Sorry I'm not sure what you mean...\nteacher: education effective...!\nstudent: Highly likely?? for example\nteacher: yes absolutely - as in: it is highly likely that global warming will continue to increase\nstudent: I see\nteacher: e.g. same as very likely ( a bit more formal and maybe more emphatic but very common!)\nteacher: probable' = more or less formal than 'likely' ?\nstudent: 7a?\nteacher: yes good!\nstudent: 8c\nteacher: yes great Liam Smith - so i think you got them all right yeah? wel l done\nstudent: I was just lucky this time hehe\nteacher: naahhh - you're solid! sorry back to question on probable and likely if you can\nteacher: do you see it?\nstudent: ahh sorry, I missed it\nteacher: no worries\nstudent: No idea, I would say that probable is more formal but I'm not sure\nteacher: yes that's exactly right - considerably more formal - as an adverb 'probably' really common but as an adjective much less so\nteacher: any other doubts apart from question 6?\nstudent: I didn't know, I always use probable because we have the same word in Spanish\nteacher: yes i guessed that would encourage to use it in English\nteacher: that's why Spanish peopel often use formal sounding words (you know this i'm sure)\nstudent: Maybe the words in question 1. Not sure about the uses of letters b and d\nteacher: yes I was wondering if number 1 might catch you out\nteacher: well with 'range' you need to specify the values do you see?\nteacher: same basic meaning but you need to say e.g. ranges from x to y\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: so e.g. in the UK the weather varies (very general and more common) but e.g. the climate ranges from cold and wet in the north to warm and sunny int he south (not quite true but as stupied example)\nstudent: I undestand\nteacher: waver' is like you can't decide on something so e.g. I'm wavering between applying for the job or carrying on as i am\nteacher: or e.g. wavering over whether to apply for the job\nstudent: Could we say 'the climate varies from cold and wet... instead?\nteacher: commonly collocates with e.g. support for the government is wavering (i.e. weakening / faltering )\nteacher: good question - yes!\nteacher: so maybe you often say 'it depends' Liam Smith to a question like: 'is it always raining in the UK?' but we often say answer i'it varies' as an initial simple answer (do you see?)'\nteacher: it varies'\nstudent: yes\nteacher: ok great - would you like to have a go at page 14?\nstudent: sure\nteacher: ok\nstudent: I did this exercise not too long ago and I kind of remember the answers\nstudent: Shall we go to the last test?\nteacher: yes ok\nstudent: page 149\nteacher: page 149?\nteacher: yes!\nstudent: 17 inconvenients?\nteacher: ok so you know those shops that are open 24 hours a day...? they're called _______ stores?\nteacher: convenience stores!\nteacher: does taht help?\nstudent: No idea (In Spain we call them 24 hours) hah\nteacher: ok isee!\nteacher: ok i see!\nstudent: inconvenience then?\nteacher: yes but not coutable\nteacher: countable\nstudent: inconvenience\nteacher: yes!\nstudent: wrong spelling, sorry. Should be 'inconvenience' right?\nstudent: 18 transactions\nteacher: yes sorry - wasn't correcting spelling mistakes - i'm making so many myself trying to type fast!\nteacher: yes great for 18\nstudent: 19 tendency?\nteacher: yes!\nstudent: 20 transferable\nteacher: good\nstudent: I don't know the next one :(\nteacher: yes I guessed this would be tricky - definitely the hardest one so far! so a person who provides funds/finance is a ....financier (and in the plural here = financiers)\nstudent: I see\nteacher: do you know e.g. Warren Buffet/George Soros?\nstudent: nope\nstudent: nope\nstudent: No\nstudent: Ohh sorry, suddenly my keyboard didn't work\nteacher: (wow website issue there I guess!) ....ok they're well-known financiers...!billionaires (investor = similar word)\nstudent: Ohh sorry, suddenly my keyboard didn't work",
    "student: Hi Ms. Anderson\nstudent: Sorry, I'm a bit late...\nteacher: Hi Emily Smith , no problem! Everything OK?\nstudent: I'm having problems with my laptop, it's taking too long to respond (I don't know how to say it in English)\nteacher: respond better than react\nstudent: yes\nteacher: ok well hopefully it'll be good enough - we'll see how it goes\nstudent: I hope so too\nteacher: so, did you have time to write any examples of the language we looked at before?!\nstudent: I didn't have time to do the exercise in page 128 but I wrote some sentences\nteacher: ok that's fine - can you show me an example?\nstudent: sure, I'll copy them here\nteacher: ok\nstudent: Highly:  Working in education requires highly commited people. Being highly qualified can be an obstacle to getting certain jobs. It is highly likely that it will snow this winter\nteacher: ok thanks hold on a sec\nteacher: yeah good examples - highly committed for jobs/roles etc and e.g. to goals/values\nteacher: so e.g. As a teacher I'm highly committed ...can you finish that?\nteacher: I mean with an example\nteacher: e.g. my goal = poorer students suceed\nstudent: I'm highly committed to my students' success?\nteacher: ok wait\nstudent: committed with or to??\nteacher: common would be e.g. highly committed to helping my students improve/to my students' success\nteacher: so 'to' yes good\nstudent: I see\nteacher: so e.g. People in Greenpeace are.....(can you finish it with an example)!\nstudent: ...are highly committed to defending our planet?\nstudent: or better\nstudent: to protecting the environment (maybe better)\nteacher: ok great thanks - you can imagine Emily Smith that this kind of sentence is really common in publicity for companies/organisations etc\nteacher: yes second example better\nteacher: maybe defending our planet a bit more emotional\nstudent: Ok, thanks\nteacher: or e.g. against alien attack!\nstudent: I understand\nteacher: i like your second example e.g. highly qualified is an obstacle! can you give me an example?\nstudent: It could happen that someone highly qualified is rejected when (applies or applying) for a job that doesn't require qualifications.\nstudent: sorry!! a job that doesn't require qualifications\nteacher: ok hold on\nstudent: I don't know how to use the verb apply in that case\nteacher: so...when applying/when they apply (both correct) for a job that...= good yes\nteacher: can you say that again with less words and the word 'might' Not the whole sentence just the first bit\nstudent: Someone highly qualified might be rejected when applying for a job that doesn't require qualifications?\nteacher: yeah that's great - better than 'it could happen that' (not wrong technically but feels a bit Spanish maybe?!)\nstudent: haha very Spanish\nteacher: qualifications usually plural by the way - just checking!\nteacher: so, the adjective 'overqualified' would be common here for this idea in English\nstudent: I see\nteacher: even if really you only need 'one' qualification e.g. a degree in economics or whatever\nteacher: I imagine there are quite a few 'overqualified' people in Spain? Is that right?\nstudent: Do you mean that even when we talk about one qualification we should use the word in plural??\nstudent: Talking about Spain... Yes, there are a lot of people with more than one degree\nteacher: yes that's right really - seems a bit strange i kknow but e.g. if we talk about doctors we say 'you need  a lot of qualifications' but really we mean you need a medical degree you know? sorry quite a few means quite a lot (i guess you know that - just checking again!)\nteacher: yes you knew 'quite a few'!\nteacher: A bit more on your last example about the possibility of snow: so you can say either \u201cIt is highly likely that\u2026.\u201dor \u201cit is highly likely to\u2026\u201d (can you finish both?)\nteacher: with your snow example again i mean\nstudent: It is highly likely that it will snow later\nteacher: ok great thanks (just because you originally wrote: 'that itsnows'\nstudent: It is highly likely that we will get some snow later? Not sure\nteacher: that it snows\nstudent: I see, sorry\nteacher: that's OK! ....so, 'it is highly likely to + infinitive' e.g. likely to snow\nteacher: very common structure\nstudent: It is highly likely to snow later??\nteacher: yes perfect!\nteacher: a bit formal for the weather i guess but you'll see it alot\nteacher: a lot\nstudent: I get it, thanks\nstudent: Shall I copy other examples?\nteacher: yes go for it!\nstudent: Firmly:  John's project was firmly rejected by his boss. That business is now firmly established in the country. I'm firmly convinced that she is guilty\nteacher: yes all good/authentic -hold on a sec\nteacher: so, a business can be firmly established and e.g. links/correlations/guilt\nteacher: facts\nteacher: similar in Spanish I guess?\nstudent: I don't understand it\nteacher: so e.g. the link between lung cnacer and smoking was firmly established as early as the 1950s but tobacco companies did not want the truth to be revealed etc\nstudent: Are you saying that we can say that guilt/links can be firmly established?\nteacher: yes exactly\nstudent: I understand now, thanks\nstudent: Not really, we don't say 'firmemente establecido' it sounds very serious, old fashioned and too formal\nteacher: sorry Emily Smith give me a minute sorry! - I just have to move my car I'm blocking some in apparently\nteacher: someone\nstudent: Don't worry!!\nteacher: hi again sorry about that!  ok yeah i understand bout the Spanish - a bit formal too in English I guess but still totally  'normal' i.e. not old-fashioned\nteacher: Emily Smith I can't remember - did i recommend a language corpus website to you before?\nstudent: Yes, you did\nteacher: ok great - the BNC/BYU one right? Did you have a look/did it work?\nstudent: I checked it out and I think it is very useful\nstudent: yes, that one!\nteacher: ok great stuff!\nstudent: Thank you!!\nteacher: no worries...do you fancy having a quick go now at page 128 before we finish - or any questions you want to ask...?!\nstudent: Yes please\nstudent: I'm not sure about number 1\nstudent: local to or native to? I mean b or c? Not sure at all because I don't like any of them before 'to'\nteacher: ok - so the idea here is that it didn't come from somewhere else - it was there already - does that help?\nstudent: resident?\nstudent: haha no  idea\nteacher: resident in/of (and maybe hasn't always been)..........inhabitant of..........the Americas is too big for 'local'  so...\nstudent: native\nteacher: yes!\nstudent: haha great!\nteacher: typically a country/region (or continent as in this example)\nstudent: So, I am native to Spain??\nteacher: um...not you as an individual - that sounds funny!! -\nteacher: typically animals/plants\nstudent: so kangaroos are native to Australia?\nteacher: yes good example!\nstudent: I understand it now...\nteacher: sorry by the way you can say that you are 'a native of Spain' (though not very common to be honest\nstudent: 2d\nteacher: at least definitely not in normal speaking\nteacher: yes good\nstudent: 3b\nteacher: yep well done\nstudent: 4a\nteacher: good\nstudent: difficult one! why not tasteful flavour?\nteacher: good question - well 'tasteful' has different meaning i.e. it doesn't mean something tastes good do you know the meaning?\nteacher: sorry i guess not! it means 'in good taste' do you see?\nstudent: Yes, I think I understand the reason\nteacher: as in, in terms of behavior/ preferences/style/manners\nteacher: so, e.g.  tastefully decorated\nteacher: i.e. according to agreed standards of style etc\nstudent: I see\nteacher: a bit snobby maybe to say!!\nteacher: and the opposite i.e. if a joke is in bad taste? i.e. offensive etc?\nstudent: Maybe ;)\nstudent: tasteless?\nteacher: yes good!\nstudent: I continue with number 5, I'm not sure but I'd say A\nteacher: but i've just realied that confusingly - in the negative i.e. tasteless you can also use it for food i.e. bland!\nteacher: realised\nteacher: so the idea for 5 is get smaller- does that help?\nstudent: Shrunk?\nteacher: yes good - 'concentrated' is for e.g. intensity rather than size you know?\nstudent: I see\nteacher: or e.g. flavour\nstudent: I guess we have to stop now, I'll check the meaning of 5d because I don't know that word\nteacher: ok no problem - thanks Emily Smith - we'll finish this next time - tomorrow at 4 right?\nstudent: Yes, thank you!\nteacher: ok great - speak to you then.....\nstudent: See you tomorrow, bye",
    "teacher: HI Sophia Smith\nstudent: Hi Mr. Patel,  sorry my laptop is creating problems again\nteacher: oh no! It was basically OK yesterday for this right?\nstudent: I'm using my phone at the moment\nteacher: Oh I see....well. do your best...I'll understand if you need more time!\nstudent: I'm trying to open the chat on my laptop right now\nteacher: OK....I was thinking of buying an ipad actually - do you have any Apple products?\nstudent: No, I don't. I have a tablet but I find it difficult to type on it\nteacher: yes i see - i'm getting used to one but I was thinking of making some videos so wanted to get a good quality version...\nstudent: I see\nteacher: are you on your laptop now?\nstudent: I guess  Apple products are the best ones\nstudent: Yes, finally my laptop is working :)\nteacher: yeah I think so - they're obviously quite pricey but maybe worth it if you want that extra bit  - oh ok that's great...\nteacher: I'm turning into a consumer (remember I bought a new(ish) car recently? I'm getting that retail excitement!\nteacher: no not really....I think after the ipad that'll be it for a few years!\nstudent: haha what will be next??\nteacher: well, it would be a house but that really is impossible right now (anywhere near Cambridge anyway) so maybe a bigger boat\nteacher: definitely at some point\nstudent: Maybe in another town\nstudent: Have you considered living in another city or country?\nteacher: yes could be - you have to balance affordability with commuting time of course\nteacher: well we've considered Spain/Italy/South America and in many ways I'd be happy with life there but...I guess it depends on job opportunities\nstudent: Sure, but how about moving somewhere and finding a different job... I know, it's not easy when you move with a family\nteacher: as in most basic English teaching jobs are not always that well paid/secure\nteacher: but yes you're right maybe a different job\nteacher: to be honest my wife is the one with better prospects than me!\nteacher: as in she's done a lot ore high-powered stuff so it's down to her!\nstudent: what do you mean by 'prospects'?\nteacher: ah ... you need to know that word given your area of work - it's like the likelihood f something occurring or more genreally what's in store for the future e.g. the prospects for the economy aren't good\nteacher: i.e. there's going to be a recession or whatever\nteacher: and very common in the world of work to talk about your future carrer/employmeny\nteacher: employment\nteacher: so the phrase 'job prospects' = very common\nstudent: I understand, thank you\nstudent: very useful for me\nteacher: yes - it would be a very high frequency word in this area\nteacher: Sophia Smith, would you like to finish off page 128?\nstudent: yes, please\nteacher: ok go for it when you're ready\nstudent: we were looking at answer number 5\nteacher: yes sure...\nstudent: the answer is b but I checked the meaning of 'lessened' and it seems very similar to 'shrunk', doesn't it?\nteacher: yes that's true in general. .if i give you the subjects: violence/pain/ do they collocate with lessen or shrink?\nstudent: I didn't know the meaning of 'lessened' till yesterday but after reading the definition I would say 'lessen' because we talk about reducing the intensity\nteacher: yes that's it exactly! hold on\nteacher: so....in the exercise the subject is beans - so it's something with a size you can measure but 'lessen' is e.g. worry/fighting etc (the examples seem to me to be negative off the top of my head by the way....\nteacher: so yes intensity\nteacher: you can shrink something that's not physical too e.g. an economy but it's still measurable you see\nteacher: or rather it can shrink\nstudent: I understand now, thanks\nteacher: ok\nstudent: 6d\nteacher: yes fine\nteacher: do you this phrase\nteacher: use this phrase?\nstudent: no, never\nstudent: Do you?\nteacher: ok well....yes definitely! it's very common\nteacher: including in normal speaking\nstudent: It sounds formal to me... but I see than I'm wrong\nteacher: you know that you can something or someone for granted right?\nteacher: take something or someone for granted\nstudent: I think I know... I can't think of an example\nstudent: example\nstudent: I didn't know you could take someone for granted though\nteacher: that's ok ....so e.g. if a man takes his wife for granted then is that good or bad would you say? sorry stupid example\nstudent: I'd say that it's bad\nstudent: I looked it up in the dictionary and\nstudent: I saw this example 'Children often take their parents for granted'.\nteacher: yes absolutely...so it means that he just expects her to be there/or do everything for him or whatever\nteacher: and similarly with your parents example i.e. they just expect their parents to do everything\nteacher: maybe not always really terrible - i guess you could say that a kid with loving parents just takes it for granted and not mean it in a bad way\nstudent: I thought you had to say a bit more, to give some more info. To me it doesn't sound right... I'll write an example of what I thought it was...\nteacher: ok...\nstudent: Parents could say to very lazy children 'Don't take for granted that I'm going to pay for everything you want just because I'm your mother/father, you should study and do what you're supposed to do'\nstudent: haha very long, I know...\nstudent: Is it correct or is it repetitive (considering that take for granted means that?)\nteacher: long and good! yes that's definitely a realistic example  - and obviously more specific - no it's not repetitive at all - it just replaces another verb like e.g. assume\nstudent: I see, thanks\nteacher: in fact Sophia Smith it is often basically a synonym for assume\nteacher: for something good or bad\nstudent: ok\nstudent: What about number 7?\nteacher: go for it!\nstudent: I would say A but I'm not sure because of the prep. with\nteacher: yes that's a good doubt - with some of the verbs you need 'in' - which ones?\nstudent: resulted in?\nteacher: yes good - finished and resulted = in\nteacher: so...?\nstudent: no idea about the others\nteacher: b or c what do you think?\nstudent: met with' doesn't sound right at all. So hit with??\nteacher: ok I guessed this one might be tricky - the structure is a little bit formal which is why it's less familiar to you but it is very common - i.e. meet with hold on!\nteacher: so....meet with e.g. failure/success/approval/praise etc e.g. efforts to cure cancer have met with failure\nstudent: Is it a synonym of 'result'??\nteacher: um ...that'sa good question  -the basic meaning yes but the collocations are a bit different  - so e.g. meet/resulted in failure both normal but e.g. praise only goes with meet really - it's often related to how things are recived by others do you see?\nteacher: received\nstudent: I see but I think it's very hard to see difference...\nteacher: yes ...that's the trouble with collocations!\nstudent: yes\nteacher: that's the real difference: use more than meaning\nstudent: and in which situations would you use 'hit with'?\nteacher: you wouldn't!\nteacher: i.e. just hit + object\nstudent: ahhhh\nteacher: it seems like it should have a preposition I know but no...!\nstudent: So, we could say 'result' and 'finish' in, 'meet with' and 'hit' with no preposition??\nteacher: yes that's it!\nstudent: Suddenly I have a silly doubt\nteacher: go ahead....\nstudent: Do we use 'meet with' to talk about meeting someone in the street or in a similar situation?\nteacher: yeah good question...so, in the UK we usually use no preposition e.g. can I meet you later?  but in the US they see meet with you (I'm nore sure if they always do to be honest but they definitely do sometimes!\nteacher: not sure\nteacher: at least a lot more than in the UK\nstudent: ok\nstudent: I won't use it ;)\nteacher: ha! good decision...\nstudent: 8a??\nteacher: yes well done - i wasn't sure you'd get this! so the phrase get under way just means start/begin\nteacher: quite common\nstudent: I wasn't sure\nteacher: also to be underway\nteacher: i.e. is in progres\nteacher: progress\nstudent: I see\nstudent: Great, thank you! we finished the exercise with a lot of new things...\nteacher: ok thanks Sophia Smith I'll be in touch ok? are we good for next Wednesday at 4?\nteacher: yes you did well!\nstudent: Yes, sure. But I won't be able to do Thursday, sorry.\nteacher: OK no problem - I'll email you anyway I guess with an exercise number OK? Or you can you let me know one if you like (or not!)\nstudent: I'll do an exercise for Wed\nteacher: OK great - speak to you then bye!\nstudent: Thank you very much\nstudent: Bye",
    "teacher: Hi there Emily Smith - everything OK with you?\nstudent: Yes, thank you!\nteacher: OK great - Emily Smith I was wondering if you might like to talk about the topic of the environment today?\nstudent: Environment! It seems difficult. But it's OK!\nteacher: OK well....are environmental problems something you thing about much - if so, which ones?\nteacher: think\nstudent: I've been thinking about global warming recently as it's getting warmer every year!\nteacher: yes i see! I guess that's the one that's in the news most at the moment right?\nstudent: Yes, is it warmer than usual in the UK? To me, it's warmer than I expected.\nteacher: Yes it's definitely been a mild winter this year - of course it's difficult to link specific changes with global warming but overall yes it seems to be changing certainly\nteacher: also more extreme heat in the summers\nteacher: is that true in Japan too?\nstudent: Yes, Japanese summer is getting terrible... A lot of people die because of the heat every year.\nstudent: I'm worried about the Olympics in the summer!\nteacher: yes that's awful - I guess it's very humid too?\nstudent: Yes, it's very humid. I cannot go out at noon in the summer.\nteacher: Yes I see - When I lived in Spain it sometimes reached 40 degrees or more but because it was a dry heat it was bearable you know?\nstudent: 40 degrees! Amazing... Yes, if it's dry you don't feel as hot.\nteacher: OK Emily Smith on the topic of climate change: what would you say are the main causes of global warming?\nstudent: sorry I'm back!\nstudent: It's because of CO2?\nteacher: Yes absolutely - what's happening with CO2?\nstudent: CO2 emissions are going up because of the consumption of fossil fuels, and in addition, there are fewer plants that change CO2 into O2.\nstudent: O2\nstudent: Sorry, plants 'are'\nteacher: great answer! yes, so carbon emissions are increasing because we are 'burning fossil fuels' (collocation 1) and .....when you say plants - what kind of plants and where especially would you say?\nstudent: I think they are rain forests.\nstudent: For example, in the Amazon\nteacher: I think that's definitely true - so...'destruction of rainforests (collocation number 2!)is definitely another main cause - what about the consequences of global warming?!\nstudent: Ice at the North Pole or the South Pole will melt and sea levels will rise. Some islands will be under the sea water because of the higher sea levels\nteacher: Thanks Emily Smith - a demanding question and you've given a very good answer! hold on\nteacher: so i'l give you the three-word collocations for your ideas: melting ice caps and rising sea levels - what about one more? what about the weather?\nstudent: Weather...? You mean temperature will rise?\nteacher: ok, yes that's a good example - any other weather effects?\nstudent: Desert area will increase?\nteacher: yes good one (well bad obviously!) thanks - if i say: drought/heatwaves/tornadoes/hurricanes - what kind of weather is that?\nteacher: one word adjective!\nstudent: disastrous?\nteacher: yes it could be! i.e. if it caused a problem (of course it often does) - but a more 'neutral' word I guess is 'extreme''\nstudent: Do you call them 'extreme weather'?\nteacher: Absolutely yes the two words together: so, the three collocations for the consequences are; rising sea levels/melting ice caps and extreme weather - last category: what about the solutions?!\nstudent: It's reducing CO2 emissions. For example, using solar/wind energy instead of fossil fuels.\nteacher: yes fantastic - so one answer is to 'reduce carbon emissions' (Collocation!) - what kind of energy is e.g. solar/wind\nstudent: Ah, sorry. Carbon emissions... Solar/wind energy is alternative energy.\nteacher: Thanks Emily Smith - yes, alternative sources of energy is definitely possible to say - can i give you the following collcoaiton for today: 'renewable energy sources' - also, don't worry, CO2 is correct too (in fact technically more correct I guess!) and common too...\nteacher: I guess the scientific asnwers are clear enough - why do you think this might not happen?\nstudent: Renewable energy sources... I think it's difficult to build new energy plants. They cost a lot, and they need a huge area.\nteacher: yes good point - I guess you need a lot of initial investment - also some countries e.g. Saudi Arabia...?\nstudent: Some countries rely on fossil fuels for their export, and it's hard for them not to use fossil fuels.\nstudent: relies \u2192rely\nteacher: Clearly out Emily Smith - well done .....(yes rely and with 'on' afterwards)  - I guess it's difficult to 'reach global agreement' (collocation number 8 and the last one!)on what action to take\nteacher: clearly put  I meant\nteacher: Emily Smith - are you happy with the form/meaning of the 8 collocations we've looked at?\nstudent: I see. Yes, they are very useful especially when I watch News!\nteacher: yes - they're definitely high-frequency this topic - I'm going to give you a quick practice OK?  maybe have a quick look back at them now and then I'll ask you a question and try not to look back but do it from memory OK?!\nstudent: OK!\nteacher: OK so use a two- or three-word collocation to replace some of the words in the following example! a. The most immediate danger for many coastal communities is that the level of the water is getting higher and higher every year\nteacher: to replace the bit after 'communities...'\nstudent: sea levels rising\nteacher: ok thanks - yes! but you'd have to say : the danger is that sea levels are rising (which is fine!)  - here we could also just say the danger is rising sea levels\nteacher: can you say 'increasing sea levels' do you think?\nstudent: I don't think so. Increase cannot be used to refer to higher level.\nteacher: OK thanks - you're right i.e. we don't really use it for sea levels (because the collocation is with 'rise') but we do use increase with some things i.e. increased heart rate\nteacher: it's just a question of collocation you know?\nteacher: Here's one more: Probably the most effective solution to global warming is to use types of energy that never run out, like solar power.\nstudent: Probably the most effective solution to global warming is to use renewable energy sources, like solar power.\nteacher: ok great! sources in plural yes! One more: Awareness of the effects of global warming is increasing because of the really bad storms and hot summers many areas of the world experiencing.\nstudent: Awareness of the effects of global warming is increasing because of the extreme weather many areas of the world are experiencing.\nteacher: great! Another one:The most important measure we can take is to stop releasing so much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.\nstudent: The most important measure we can take is to reduce carbon emissions.\nteacher: great yes! emissions in plural yes! Last one: It is impossible for one country, however powerful, to solve the problem of global warming. The only answer is for many major countries to talk to each other and find an answer together.\nstudent: Weather cannot be plural, right?\nteacher: basically no!\nstudent: It is impossible for one country, however powerful, to solve the problem of global warming. The only answer is for many major countries to reach global agreement.\nteacher: OK that's great thanks Emily Smith - I guess that's it for today - OK with the topic? Not too formal for you?!\nstudent: Articles and plurals are difficult for the Japanese...\nteacher: Yes of course I understand\nstudent: It's formal but helpful for me! Thank you so much.\nteacher: You did pretty well under pressure!\nteacher: OK no problem - I'll be in touch soon to to arrange another lesson OK? thanks bye\nstudent: OK! Thank you in your busy time. See you soon!",
    "teacher: Hi Hannah Smith!\nstudent: Hi Ms. Rachel Thompson.\nteacher: So, this'll be our last lesson for a bit - I hope you continue to study for the CAE exam!\nstudent: I know, unfortunately no more lessons for a while...\nstudent: Are you happy to work on the teacher training course again?\nstudent: course\nteacher: Yes I am to be honest - it's good to do something a bit different (a change is as good as a rest as we say) - and , although itisn't the main aim, it helps develop your own teaching too of course!\nstudent: What do you mean when you say that it helps your own teaching?\nteacher: Well, because you have to think a lot about why the trainees' teaching is good or bad, and all thhose considerations stay with you when you teach yourself you see? So you are quicker to recognize what might work better or e.g. different ways of doing things.\nstudent: I see. I can imagine the amount of useful information you get from observing other teacher and students\nteacher: Yes you're right - I guess you have time to think about things more because you're not just focused on what you're doing you know? Actually, I\u2019ll tell you a big reason: because you see everything much more from the students\u2019 point of view, which really helps you to appreciate how to make lessons as effective as possible.\nstudent: That's great!\nteacher: But of course my main job is to help trainees pass the course!!\nteacher: What do you do to keep up with your English Hannah Smith? Do you watch series/films for example?\nstudent: The other part is a side effect ;)\nteacher: yes!\nstudent: Yes, I listen to podcasts and watch movies and series in English but not as much as I should... I don't have time to do everything I want\nstudent: I also teach. I only have 2 students but I'm in touch with English almost everyday...\nteacher: No of course - never enough time....I was thinking that part of the difficulty with e.g. the CAE exam is getting familiar with the range of language they test you on. Sometimes watching/listening to more formal stuff can be helpful\nstudent: the English language I mean\nteacher: e.g. factual programmes\nteacher: or topic-specific stuff\nstudent: Factual??\nstudent: Documentaries for example?\nteacher: yes, because e.g. documentaries often use more formal language\nstudent: sure\nteacher: or current affairs (if you're into that)\nteacher: not only poilitics!\nteacher: politics\nstudent: current affairs?\nteacher: ah is that a new phrase for you?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: OK well the 'news' is more what's just happened obviously (in the very recent past - especially nowadays but...\nteacher: the wider issues might be written about in a range of formats...\nteacher: e.g. Time magazine isn't exactly news - it reflects on the relevant issues of the day (hence 'current')\nteacher: and I guess some newspaper content...\nteacher: like weekly columnists etc\nstudent: I understand\nteacher: So they might cover e.g. social/environmental/political/cultural topics\nteacher: and you'll come across loads of useful language!\nteacher: so you teach English? That's great - do you enjoy it?!\nstudent: I know, I should watch a documentary and read an article everyday. Maybe a month before the exam I'll try to do it but it takes a lot of time and energy\nteacher: yeah sure -try to pick things you're interested in anyway right?!\nstudent: Yes, I've been teaching for a few years. I should teach Spanish instead but the people I know need help with English haha\nstudent: I love teaching, I really enjoy it\nteacher: OK that's  good to hear - I basically enjoy it too (although I've been doing it for a long time now! Also, I kind of envy you you're small classes!\nteacher: And long-term students I guess?\nstudent: I understand what you say, I think I enjoy it a lot because it's not my profession. I kind of do it as a hobby\nstudent: About my students, yes they have been coming to classes for a year or so\nteacher: Ah yes I see what you mean - my problem is that I can't imagine working a 9 to 5 job (you know what I mean?) so the only thing that appeals to me is e.g. being a film director or writer!\nteacher: We get increasingly short term students which is fine but it's more tiring/stressful\nstudent: Could you work at a school? I don't know how to say it...\nstudent: Not at a language school but at a primary or secondary school\nteacher: do you mean mainstream education i.e. a primary or secondary school?\nteacher: yes OK!\nstudent: Exactly\nteacher: more informally you could just say 'normal' school\nteacher: with kids'\nstudent: yes\nstudent: I guess you prefer working with adults\nteacher: um....I think I prefer adults to be honest\nteacher: yes!\nstudent: hah\nteacher: Nothing against kids per se but....a lot of its crowd control!\nteacher: maybe in a private school.....\nstudent: And maybe it is more interesting to work with foreigners, or not?\nteacher: I don't know the reputation of private schools in Spain?\nteacher: Um...yes I think maybe you're right about foreigners yes\nstudent: I really enjoy going to English classes in England for example. There you can meet people from so many different countries and see what they are like...\nteacher: Yes! I certainly feel like I've learned a lot about the world from teaching so many people from everywhere (and without having to go there!)\nstudent: what they are like\nteacher: good correction!\nteacher: a hell of a lot actually\nteacher: Hannah Smith would you like to have a quick go at e.g. page 147 from your book before we finish!?\nteacher: Hannah Smith (sorry)\nstudent: Sure\nteacher: ok...\nstudent: 1d\nteacher: yes\nstudent: no idea about number 2 but I would say A\nteacher: so the meaning is like 'ignore'/ 'fail to notice/recognise' - does that help?\nstudent: I don't know the meaning of the words\nteacher: oversee = supervise and overgrown makes no sense here so...'overlook' is the one you want!\nstudent: Doesn't 'over' mean something like more that it should?\nteacher: yes i see what you mean - often that's true...\nteacher: i'm trying to think of different examples...\nstudent: If I have to make up a word that means 'ignore' using the word 'look', I would thing of something with 'under' but never 'over'\nteacher: yes I understand!\nstudent: Do you know why I'm confused?\nteacher: I guess it's like you look beyond you see? As in ignoring what's right in front of you (e.g. down on the ground)\nteacher: so if you look over someone's head you're not looking at their head\nteacher: but above their head\nstudent: I see what you mean\nstudent: So 2B\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: Worth remembering  by the way i.e. not very obscure...quite normal\nstudent: I don't know number 3 either :(\nstudent: ranks?\nstudent: rows?\nteacher: first answer = good yes - go with your instinct!\nstudent: ok\nteacher: same meaning as 'rows' really but collocates with 'join'\nteacher: you could say 'join the row' but it sounds literal\nstudent: I see\nstudent: 4c\nteacher: yes good!\nstudent: 5d\nteacher: 5 is tricky - you need an adjective after utterly e.g. utterly confused (!) - same with b and c BUT virtually + e.g. no fat /all the people etc = good\nstudent: so the answer is virtually?\nteacher: yes!\nstudent: ahhh\nstudent: 6d\nteacher: yep!\nstudent: 77b\nteacher: well done!\nstudent: 8c\nteacher: OK great  - a clear pass at CAE!\nstudent: haha\nstudent: The beginning was terrible!!\nteacher: Well I forgive you the 'ranks' one - but not the 'overlook'! :)\nstudent: oh thank you!\nteacher: OK Hannah Smith thanks for today - I'll be in touch later next month OK?\nteacher: Keep studying!\nstudent: Great! Thank you very much. Good luck with the future teachers ;)\nteacher: OK cheers bye bye\nstudent: Bye bye",
    "teacher: Hi Rebecca Jones, are you there?!\nstudent: yes\nteacher: OK great! Hello....so, just for a bit of background...are you planning to do the IELTS excam soon?\nteacher: exam i mean\nstudent: I have to do an IELTS exam in April\nteacher: OK right - are you planning to go to univeristy in the UK?\nstudent: not in the UK, but it'll be in the English language\nteacher: Right I see - so, in ITaly (?) but a course in English - is that a first degree or a master's? And what subject by the way?\nstudent: perhaps in Italy,but in English\nteacher: ok\nstudent: first degree\nstudent: medicine, but in Italy the entrance test is impossible to pass, so maybe I'll study genomics\nteacher: Oh right - there's lots of work in that area here in CAmbridge you know that right?!\nstudent: I know that in Cambridge you must have the highest mark in the maturity exam\nstudent: is it right?\nteacher: do you mean it's hard to get into Cambridge University?\nteacher: And do you mean the exams you do at the end of secondary school?\nstudent: no, I mean in Italy when you finish high school, you have to do an important exam, and I know that to get into Cambridge University you have to get 100\\100\nstudent: if you want to study medicine\nteacher: OK I see...wait a sec\nteacher: Well in the UK you know that when you're 16 you have to choose 'A' level sybjects (usually 3) and the results for these determine your chances of getting into a particular university\nteacher: so if you get an 'a' grade it's like 10 points etc and for e.g. Cambridge you basically need an A in all of your 'A' levels\nteacher: So I imagine that you need top marks in the equivalent Italian qualification\nstudent: also if I'm not an English person?\nteacher: if you did 'A' levels yes but the equivalent if not\nteacher: by the way can you change the verb to something else in the phrase 'take high marks'?\nstudent: ah ok I've understood\nstudent: maybe have high marks\nteacher: yes possible, good! (NOT 'take'!) 'get' is the most common verb\nteacher: and therefore e.g. 'get' 10 out of 10/get a B etc\nstudent: thanks\nteacher: get a high score etc etc\nteacher: OK Rebecca Jones so if you don't mind I'll start asking you questions based on the pie charts OK?\nstudent: yes!\nteacher: OK great so....can you write s sentence describing ONLY the following: Australia 1980 coal\nteacher: As in NOT about change over time or France or any other fuel JUST those items OK?\nteacher: one short sentence\nstudent: ok\nteacher: ok\nteacher: Take a minute if you need it!\nteacher: Think about the subject of the charts overall\nstudent: the coal production was 50% in Australia in 1980\nstudent: too simple a sentence?\nteacher: OK thanks a lot Rebecca Jones...wait a sec\nteacher: so no, not too simple\nteacher: you've got past simple verb = good\nstudent: one question\nteacher: go\nteacher: one question: are the charts about coal production????\nstudent: in this case, I can't use the verb halve?\nteacher: ah! Can you ask my question first??\nstudent: electricity production\nteacher: Yes! exactly good!\nteacher: So...'coal production'??\nstudent: coal of electricity?\nstudent: I don't know\nteacher: OK no problem hold on a sec\nstudent: I asked myself the same question when I was writing the sentence\nteacher: well...If you begin with e.g. Australia....can you continue from here?\nteacher: you need a verb next obviously so 'Australia....'?\nstudent: Australia used 50% of electricity....\nteacher: OK nearly...! Did Australia 'use' electricity? well obviously yes but what about coal?\nteacher: so ...'Australia used _____ to _______?\nstudent: australia used 50% of coal electricity ?\nstudent: ah one moment\nteacher: ok\nstudent: Australia used 50% to coal\nteacher: OK thanks Rebecca Jones - let's try it together a bit more....hold on\nstudent: yes thanks\nteacher: the '50%' refers to electricity right?\nteacher: so....Australia used coal to produce....?\nstudent: 50% of electricity\nteacher: Yes good!\nteacher: So it's not a percentage of coal you see?\nteacher: it's a percentage of ELECTRICITY from different fuels\nstudent: yes now I have understood\nteacher: OK great! Can you try a different way of giving the same information e.g. Australia coal 1980 but this time starting with the number e.g. 50 units...\nteacher: so 'Fifty units of...'\nstudent: 50 units of electricity are produced by Australians from the use of coal\nteacher: Yes good well done! hold on\nteacher: so passive great yes but let's keep it in the past simple so...'were produced from'\nstudent: ok\nteacher: what about beginning with the word 'coal'?!\nteacher: so same information but different first word!\nstudent: coal was used by Australian people to produce 50% of electricity\nteacher: yes that's very good Rebecca Jones! hold on\nstudent: thank you\nteacher: so I don't know if you've  done this before...do you know the verb 'account for'?\nstudent: on account of\nstudent: is it the same?\nteacher: ah! no, it's not the same... Ok well, when we have a proportion of a total (i.e. with pie charts) we can use it so....e.g. 'Coal accounted for...'\nstudent: is it the same?*\nteacher: Can you continue?\nstudent: accounted for electricity?\nteacher: Yes - what proportion?\nteacher: or percentage - same thing basically\nteacher: not a trick question!\nstudent: I can't explain the meaning but in Italian it is a very similar word so I know the meaning ahah\nstudent: trust me\nteacher: So...'Coal accounted for 50% of electricity production in Australia in 1980.'\nteacher: yes I  know what you mean about the Italian!\nteacher: You can also the verb 'make up'  - hold on\nteacher: in your morning class how many students are there more or less?\nstudent: 7 maybe\nteacher: ok and how many male students?\nstudent: 5.0\nteacher: OK so can you tell me that with the verb  'account for' and the word 'majority' for the proportion??\nteacher: you OK? Begin with the word 'males' - does that help?\nstudent: male students account for the majority of my morning class\nteacher: Yes very good!\nteacher: So the total/title/subject  in a pie chart would be e.g. 'Students' so...the small category first e.g. Males followed by the account for followed by the total - OK?\nteacher: One last test: use the same structure to tell me about France Oil 1980 OK? A full sentence!\nstudent: ok\nteacher: ok\nstudent: oil accounted for 20% of electricity production in France in 1980\nteacher: Fanatastic!\nteacher: You'd get a good score with that language\nstudent: thank you\nteacher: One last thing before we finish...\nstudent: sure\nteacher: So yuo can give the percentage = good but it's also good if you use other words to EXPLAIN what it means so e.g. can you say 'In 1980 coal was big in Australia'? is big the right word?\nstudent: the majority\nteacher: OK thanks good idea - but is it??\nteacher: 50 out of 100?\nstudent: half\nteacher: is that a mpjority?\nteacher: OK yes good half - that's good if you use fractions too and not just percentages\nteacher: But also other adjectives....so can you change 'big' to another adjective?\nstudent: yes thanks\nstudent: you mean a synonym\nstudent: right?\nteacher: yes!\nstudent: huge\nteacher: in this context anyway\nstudent: high\nteacher: so huge is a good idea (bit 'emotional' for IELTS!) 'a high proportion' is a good phrase ..\nteacher: how about 'important/significant'?!\nteacher: sound good?\nstudent: yes!\nteacher: Yes I agree! So e.g. 'Coal was the most significant fuel in 1980 in Australia, producing 50% of electricity = very good OK?\nstudent: yes crystal clear\nteacher: OK nice phrase! thanks a lot Rebecca Jones - I'll speak to you tomorrow about more lessons OK?\nstudent: yes, sure\nteacher: bye bye\nstudent: thank you very much\nstudent: bye",
    "teacher: Hi Sophia!\nstudent: hi!\nteacher: Listen I'm on my phone today so apologies in advance for spelling and taking a ling time to type!\nstudent: no problem\nteacher: I mean long - you see!\nstudent: don't worry\nteacher: Ok\nteacher: Thanks\nteacher: So....would you like to start with more on the pie charts?\nstudent: it's ok with me\nteacher: Ok great- so can you tell me about oil in austr0alia in 1980 please\nstudent: Australia used oil to produce 10% of electricity\nstudent: or\nteacher: Ok very good - and beginning with 'oil'?\nstudent: oil accounted for 10% of electricity production in 1980\nteacher: Ok that's great Sophia - ok next step: can you describe the change in Australia in e.g. natural gas in the two charts?\nteacher: All ok?! Do want me to give you a bit of help? Try something if you can though!\nstudent: there was a drop in the percentage of natural gas used in Australia between 1980 and 2000\nteacher: Sorry i was being pessimistic! Ok that's pretty good!\nstudent: I couldn't find natural gas in the second chart\nstudent: 0.02\nteacher: Ah yes i see what you mean!\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Be careful though...hold on...\nstudent: sorry\nteacher: No problem!\nstudent: ok\nteacher: So...saying percentage of gas used is a bit strange...\nstudent: how can I say it?\nteacher: Because it's the percentage of electricity produced from gas - do you see?\nteacher: A simimar problem as tbe other day\nteacher: So...you can sat e.g. there was a drop inthr percentage of ....?\nteacher: In the\nstudent: the percentage of electricity produced from natural gas\nstudent: ?\nteacher: Yes good!\nteacher: Much better\nteacher: Would need the figures in your real answer?\nteacher: The numbers i mean - you know the word figures right?\nstudent: which word?\nteacher: Figures' - it means numbers\nstudent: ahhh\nteacher: What is in Italian?!\nstudent: numeri\nstudent: almost the same ahah\nteacher: Can you say cifra too?\nstudent: in Italian?\nteacher: Yes!\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Ok right\nstudent: well done\nteacher: Haha\nteacher: So...the question before: do you need to include le cifre!\nteacher: ?\nstudent: I don't think so\nteacher: Or is just the words enough?\nstudent: but I'm not sure\nteacher: No you definitely need the numbers!\nteacher: Remember: your job is to describe the charts so i dont ned to see them do you see?\nstudent: yes I understand\nteacher: I.e. i can more or less draw them from your answer!\nteacher: Sophia let me give you an examole sentence hold on....\nstudent: can I include numbers in another sentence ?\nstudent: or the same?\nteacher: How do you mean? Give me an example if you can\nteacher: Sorry mg example from before: while natural gas accounted for 10% of electricity in 1980 in 2000 it was an insignificant source, contributing only 2%\nstudent: there was a drop in the percentage of electricity produced from natural gas used in Australia between 1980 and 2000\nstudent: and after that can I write your sentence?\nstudent: or do I need only one?\nteacher: Oh i see - no one is enough and you can just inckude the numbers...\nstudent: ah ok ok\nteacher: Try to be concise\nteacher: Have you put numbers in bracjets with your ielts teachers\nteacher: ?\nteacher: Brackets i mean - you understand?\nstudent: yes I understand\nstudent: but no, we haven't\nteacher: Ok so this is a quick and easy wat!\nteacher: Way\nstudent: ok thanks\nteacher: Sophia: small change in focus here- can i ask you to say what information your conclusion/overview woukd include for these charts?\nteacher: You can just answer in basic keywords if you like - dont worry about being pretty!\nstudent: I always have the same problem the with conclusion\nteacher: Ok well...usualyy it's  only 2 or 3 main points right?\nstudent: because I have to write a short conclusion\nteacher: If it helps imagine a newspaper article- what big thing would tbese charts illustrate in the story\nstudent: but for example in this case there are a lot of things to say\nteacher: No!!!! Only the main things 2 or 3 !\nstudent: because there aren't any definite upward or downward trends\nstudent: definite\nteacher: Ok but e.g. Australia - whats one big thing?\nteacher: Or the biggest thing let's say\nstudent: coal\nteacher: Ok great i agree so you just need to say that coal was quite importand and then the most important by far right?\nteacher: And france?\nstudent: nuclear power\nteacher: Ok fine - so in 2000 both countries....?\nstudent: soared\nteacher: Sorry I'm back\nteacher: Hold on hold on!\nstudent: no problem\nteacher: So wait a minute: e.g in 2000 both countries relied on ine main source of fuel to generate electricity; australia relied on coal while France used nuclear power\nteacher: One main source\nteacher: One more little thing: the amount of electricity itself - do you need to mention this?\nstudent: no\nteacher: Yes!\nteacher: Why not?! It's  important no?!\nstudent: ah no, I was thinking about the amount of electricity in total\nstudent: sorry\nteacher: Thats ok! So you need tosay that there was a significant increase in the amount of electricity generated by both countries\nteacher: And give the numbers = one short sentence\nteacher: Do you need the numbers fir the main points e.g. cosl and nuclear in the conclusion?\nstudent: so can I choose the most important features and put these in my conclusion?\nteacher: Yes exactly- that's what it's for!\nteacher: But without the numbers normally because you will have explthese in your main paragraphs you see\nteacher: Explained these\nstudent: so I don't have to summarize everything in a few lines?\nteacher: When you say everything you mean e.g every fuel?\nstudent: yes, in general\nteacher: No because that wouldn't be a summary just a list of the data you see\nteacher: They want to see that you've understood whatsoever the most important\nstudent: yes, in fact, in my latest essay I didn't write the conclusion\nteacher: Sophia - ill give you an example answer for these charts ok and you'll see how to do it more easily\nstudent: we don't need one, do we?\nstudent: ok thanks\nstudent: thanks\nteacher: Hold on - yes, you do need some kind of summary/overview/conclusion paragraph but just one ok?\nstudent: ok I understood\nteacher: Maybe at the beginning or end fir the graohs etc and just at the end fir the essay\nstudent: thank you\nteacher: Ok cool- ill find you tomorrow and give you the answer - thanks a lot bye!\nstudent: thank you!\nstudent: bye",
    "teacher: Hi Emily Smith are you there?\nstudent: Hi Ms. Rodriguez, I\u2019m here\nteacher: Ok great sorry i missed your email but you found the site!\nteacher: Emily Smith do you have the pie chart sheet with you?\nstudent: That\u2019s ok, I asked Sophia Reynolds \ud83d\ude02\nteacher: Ok well xone!\nstudent: Yes, I do\nteacher: Ok by the way did  i not send you the link and the link to the consent form??\nteacher: I mean the link to the site ...i  was sure i did...\nstudent: Yes, you sent me the link, but I missed that email\nteacher: Ok no problem - i will resend the original email agter this lesson so you can complete tbe form too - thanks\nstudent: And Sophia Reynolds told me to check your email again\nteacher: After this lesson\nteacher: Ah! Ok i see\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: Well do i need to resend it then? I guess not!\nteacher: Just use the one you have later ok?\nstudent: Ok, thank you\nteacher: Ok do ...Emily Smith let's go with the charts! Could you write a short sentence with the following information please: Australia coal  1980\nteacher: Don't compare with anything else i.e. gas or another time or e.g. france Ok?\nstudent: Ah I see\nteacher: Ok I'll wait take your time....\nstudent: In 1980, Australia produced 50 units of electricity from coal\nteacher: Ok thanks Emily Smith wait a sec...\nteacher: Pretty good actually - well done ....so... let's just make a few changes to make it better but a good start i can see you understand the information\nstudent: 20 units from natural gas and also the same number of units from hydro power\nteacher: Si number one : do you need the past perfect? No! What tense?\nteacher: Ok ok slow down!\nstudent: Oh sorry\nstudent: oh sorry\nteacher: Thats ok!\nstudent: Past Simple\nteacher: Yes good ! So tell me the one-word verb in past\nstudent: Produced\nteacher: Ok great! Is 'was producing' ok?\nstudent: Ah I see\nteacher: ......no!\nstudent: Ohhh \ud83d\ude05\nteacher: Usually you'll just beed past simple = one word ok?!\nteacher: Need\nteacher: Maybe past perfect but ONLY in certain circumstances...\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: So the 50 units refers to electricity...so where does this number phrase go? Far away from the noun electricity?\nstudent: Coal?\nstudent: Sorry, what did you mean?\nteacher: Thats ok...so you need to say 50 units of...?\nteacher: Units of what?\nstudent: electricity\nstudent: \ud83d\ude05\nteacher: Yes good! So ...' Australia....' try the original sentence  again if you can....\nstudent: Australia produced 50 units of electricity from coal in 1980.\nteacher: Ok that's great! One more thing ...hold on...\nteacher: When you say what something is made of/from or where it cones from do you normally say 'from' or 'by'?\nstudent: From\nteacher: Yes good...so '50 units of electricity from coal' is enough/perfect!\nteacher: Ok?\nstudent: Ohh ok\nstudent: But why do they say \\by fuel source\\\" in the paper?\"\nstudent: Paper\nteacher: That's just to explain that these materials are sources of fuel but you dont need to repeat that\nteacher: Like a title fir the charts you know\nteacher: For\nstudent: Oh I see\nteacher: BUT ok ...lets try a sentence with the word 'source' ...hold on\nteacher: So can you explain exactly tbe same information but this time beginning with the word coal?'\nteacher: Take a minute if you need it!\nstudent: Let me think\nstudent: ok\nteacher: No rush....\nstudent: Coal was used to produce 50 units of electricity in Australia in 1980 .\nteacher: Ok Emily Smith thanks...hold on...\nteacher: Ok so you've got the passive in there...let's tame a step back ....so the first we finished:'Australia produced 50 units of electricity from coal'...can you change that into the pasdive?\nteacher: So you need to switch round the subject and object ok?\nteacher: So...begin with the word...?\nteacher: Not Australia but...?\nstudent: Ah\nstudent: Electricity\nstudent: Was produced\nteacher: Yes good...basically! But how much?\nstudent: Ahh\nstudent: 50 units of electricity were produced from coal\nteacher: Yes great well done!\nstudent: Yeah\ud83d\ude02\nteacher: So to get a good score you include different  grammar like you've  just done and maybe change the...?\nteacher: One word answer?\nteacher: Beginning with letter v!\nteacher: The letter\nstudent: V what\nstudent: Value?\nteacher: Vocabulary!\nstudent: Ah ok\nstudent: Thank you\nteacher: For example the verbs e.g. in this chart you can use 'produce' electronic...can you think of another possinverb\nteacher: Sorry...possible verb beginning with g?\nstudent: I thought you wanted me to change the sentence again\nstudent: Please let me think about that\nteacher: Ah i see sorry\nteacher: Yes no problem\nstudent: Sorry, did you mean change 'produce' to another word?\nstudent: Give?\nteacher: Yes ....dont worry...so make electricity is possible but generate is a good one!\nstudent: Ah... I forgot this word, thank you\nteacher: Sometimes if you cant think of another word its ok just repeat one you're co fident with ....your original produce was fine\nteacher: Confident\nstudent: Ah I see\nteacher: Ok so another we can change is the number i.e. we can use fractions...so 50 units in this case is...?\nstudent: 50 per cent\nstudent: 43862.0\nteacher: Yes either is fine ...but percent without s at the end!\nteacher: One final thing Emily Smith hold on....\nstudent: ok \ud83d\udc4c\nteacher: Si another giid thing in ielts is to use words ti describe the meaning of the numbers not just a list of the numbers themselves you see so...hold on...\nteacher: Good thing\nstudent: Ah\nteacher: E.g. ok fine we can say 50 units from coal but what does that mean in the context of the whole chart?\nteacher: It means that 'coal was the...?\nstudent: Wood?\nteacher: Most...?\nstudent: Plant\nstudent: Log\nteacher: No hold on...as a source of electricity coal was the most....\nstudent: Oh\nstudent: Production\nteacher: Ok we're running out of time so...'coal was the most significant source of electricity in Australia in 1980, generating 50 units out of 100 units' = a good sentence!\nteacher: Ok?\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: Your noun 'production' is a good word - we'll come back to that next tkme ok?\nteacher: Time\nstudent: Ok\nstudent: Thank you so muck, Ms. Rodriguez\nteacher: Thanks a lot Emily Smith - some good work today i think I'll  speak to you tomorrow ok thanks bye\nstudent: Bye, see you",
    "teacher: Hi Emily are you there?!\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Ok great! All ok with you?\nstudent: yes, may I send my conclusion here?\nteacher: Yes sure go for it!\nstudent: To summarise, there was a significant increase in the percentage of coal used to produce electricity in Australia between 1980 and 2000.  However, the most significant fuel used by the French was nuclear power, which accounted for 126 units.\nteacher: Ok thanks well done hold on...\nstudent: is it enough?\nteacher: Ok so...yes some good stuff here...some good grammar and you've got the major point about nuclear being significant in France you need to do the same for Australia\nteacher: I.e. not just there was a significant increase but that it was by far thr most significant fuel do you see?\nstudent: coal is the major point in Australia, isn't it?\nteacher: Yes true\nteacher: So just mentioning these two dominant fuels in thr conclusion is enough\nstudent: Do I need to explain that it is the major point?\nteacher: Well if you just put these in they automatically become the major points ...\nteacher: And this is fine\nstudent: ok ok\nteacher: Do you need any numbers in the conclusion?\nstudent: not always\nstudent: because if I have just spoken about numbers in the test it is not necessary\nteacher: Not normally ! So you've put 126 in but you dont need to...\nteacher: ...because you will have put this in your main paragraphs  you see?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: The ones with the details...\nteacher: But your concern is still pretty good\nteacher: Conclusion sorry\nteacher: Id\nteacher: I'd avoid 'meaningful ' and use more neutral significant ok?\nteacher: Or major/important etc\nstudent: why?\nstudent: Does it not have the same meaning?\nteacher: Good question! Hold on\nteacher: It's less common overall/used more in specific contexts\nteacher: Also fir quality rather than nust numbers I'd  say\nstudent: ah ok thanks\nteacher: Not appropriate for task 1 ielts\nteacher: Also...maybe you're tempted to use relevant too?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: I've seen lots of italians do this!\nstudent: is it not appropriate?\nteacher: Again not quite right in english...\nstudent: yes because we have almost the same word in Italian\nteacher: It's not used as a simple syno ym for big in english usually\nstudent: ok i understood\nteacher: Ok!\nteacher: Emily, how about introductions? Have you practised these in class?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Ok so....do you want to try a quick one for these charts? One sentence is enough ok?\nteacher: Gonna try it?\nteacher: Ok ok I'll wait if you're writing sorry\nstudent: the graphs illustrate the quantity of fuel used by Australia and France to produce electricity in 1980 and 2000\nteacher: Ok that's basically good ...you've got the right idea about how to do it and thats important\nstudent: thanks\nstudent: what can I say in a different way?\nteacher: Yeah sure hold on a sec...\nstudent: sure\nteacher: So...when you say quantity of fuel it makes me think of e.g. 100 litres of petrol do you see?\nstudent: ah yes\nteacher: How could you xhange this little bit?\nstudent: mmm\nstudent: mmm\nstudent: I can't say percentage, right?\nteacher: Hold on..\nteacher: Well yes  you can ...you can the percentage of electricity generated from different fuels = good\nteacher: You can say\nstudent: but units is like percentage?\nteacher: The word Proportion is also good for pie charts\nteacher: Well the proportions in the pie charts can be  thought of as percentages yes\nstudent: because when I think of percentages I think for example 14/100\nteacher: I understand ...the best word is proportion\nstudent: ok ok\nteacher: Apart from this you can use eords like...'significance' you know?\nstudent: synonym of numbers?\nteacher: So...the charts illustrate the significance if...'\nteacher: Of\nstudent: ah ok great\nteacher: Also better to use names of countries ratger than nationalities\nteacher: Rather than\nteacher: Ok?\nstudent: ah ok ok I wanted to change some words in the task\nteacher: With these changes your intro is great\nteacher: Ah yes i understand...well tricky with these ones!\nstudent: this was the reason why I wrote the French and the Australians\nteacher: Emily can i ask you to have a quick practice? So  So e.g. can you telll me    something about e.g. hold on dorry\nteacher: Sorry\nstudent: e g ?\nteacher: So yes about coal and oil in france across thd two years e.g. the change\nteacher: Remember things tgat are similar in task 1  = put them together = easier\nteacher: So e.g. coal and oil in france are similar acriss thr two years so try to put them together in some way do you see?\nstudent: sorry what do you mean by e.g.?\nteacher: For example!\nstudent: ah ok\nstudent: ahaha\nteacher: Ha!\nstudent: there was a similar drop in coal and oil between 1980 and 2000 in France\nstudent: ?\nteacher: Ok thanks a lot ..hold on...\nteacher: So you could say : oil and coal were both significant sources of electricity in 1980, contributing 20 and 25 units respectively but....\nstudent: yes that's better\nteacher: By 2000 their relative contribtion had fallen to...\nteacher: So.ething like this...ok?\nstudent: yes thanks\nteacher: Bit more complex i know but i think you're  ready to make this jump!\nteacher: Did you notice the verb tense in the second part?\nstudent: passive\nteacher: Um....no! So it was past simple first: in 1980 there were....but then : by 2000....?\nteacher: Their contribution...\nstudent: past perfect\nteacher: Yes ok good ....do you use this tense when you speak/write in english now?!\nstudent: I try because I know that examiners love present and past perfect\nteacher: Ha! Ok well it can be good to use in task 1 i guess...and often possible\nstudent: you are right\nteacher: Can you try a practice o e for oil in Australia using this tense?\nteacher: One\nstudent: suuuure\nteacher: Ok great I'll wait!\nstudent: I suppose for a long time ahah\nteacher: :)\nteacher: You ok?! Send me it half-finished if you like - no problem...\nstudent: Oil was not an important source of electricity in 1980, accounting for 10 units, and its contribution had fallen to only 2 units by 2000.\nteacher: Ok thanks! Hold on...\nstudent: but I used your sentence with past perfect\nteacher: That's ok - copying is good!!\nstudent: ahah ok\nteacher: Good to try using ' account for'!\nteacher: Not sure about 'was a low unit' phrase though...!\nstudent: me too\nteacher: Again Emily, using worfd like e.g. important is easy do...\nteacher: So...hold on\nstudent: ok thanks\nteacher: Oil was not an important source of electricity in 1980, accounting for 10 units, and its cintribution had fallen to only 2 units by 2000. Ok?!\nteacher: Its because singar/one fuel\nstudent: ahh\nstudent: yes\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Your 20 years later phrase was good too sorry - didn't need tochange that!\nstudent: no problem\nteacher: Ok thanks a lot Emily speak to you soon ok?

    "teacher: Hello Liam, how's it going?\nstudent: Well, thanks\nteacher: Ok so you managed to open the document I sent right?\nstudent: Sure\nteacher: OK ...can I ask you to have a go then at writing the following sentnce...hold on a sec\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: referring to the first chart: the 'satisfied' category! Not an intro or nay comparison ...just the basic fact about that category for the first chart...thanks!\nstudent: Ok\nstudent: The satisfied people during the year before the refurbishment accounted for 30%\nteacher: Thanks Liam - good to see you trying to use 'account for' again! hold on...\nteacher: so remember we can use a variety of grammar and vocabulary to get a higher score ...and some of this obviously depends on the nature of the information....\nstudent: I like using \u2018accounted for\u2019 ahah\nteacher: so this example is the results of a survey...\nteacher: try beginning with '30%' and write another example ok?\nteacher: i.e. '30% of ..........'\nstudent: 30% of people were satisfied in the year before the refurbishment\nstudent: But how can I change the word refurbishment?\nteacher: Thanks Liam - yes this is good!  hold on...\nteacher: can you add a couple of words in the gaps: 30% 0f people were satisfied _____ _____ _____ in the year before refurbishment.'\nteacher: renovation' = possible synonym for 'refurbishment'\nteacher: e.g. satisfied with/of/from' ?\nstudent: with the museum\nteacher: choose one of the three preposition above!\nstudent: But \u201c...the museum\u201d is right ?\nteacher: yes!\nstudent: with the museum?\nteacher: or: 'their._________?\nteacher: instead of 'the museum' I mean\nstudent: with their services?\nteacher: OK so bringing these two things together...e.g. '30% of people were satisified with their visit' = good\nteacher: satisfied\nstudent: Ok understood\nteacher: ok great so..using that example sentence as a model can you replace the word 'visit' with a different word?\nteacher: exp....'?!\nstudent: Experience?\nteacher: yes good! that's a good option in this context\nteacher: and can you replace 'people' ? Who are the peopel in this context?\nteacher: not a trick question - the answer is in the words in the charts\nstudent: Tourists\nteacher: ah! not a bad idea ....but a bit of a jump because I guess for example the _________ might just live next door you know?!\nteacher: visitors!!\nstudent: It has the same meaning, doesn't it?\nstudent: Visitors and tourists\nteacher: um..well it can be but a tourist suggest for example that they are on holiday/travelling and probably doing other things you see whereas a visitor might just go specifically for the museum you see\nteacher: For example, I can have visitors in my house - just people who've come to see me to talk about something but they're not tourists!\nstudent: Ahhh but can it be a way to use a different word in the essay?\nstudent: For example, if I use visitors because it\u2019s better, can I change this word ?\nteacher: It's not quite right I'd say BUT it's OK BUT there are other ways you can change other parts of your answer more accurately do you see?\nteacher: so hold on....\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: we've got now: '30% of people were satisfied with their experience' ...can we change 30%?\nteacher: sorry: 30% of visitors were satisfied with their experience\nstudent: 30/100 ahaha\nteacher: technically correct:)\nteacher: how about a fraction?\nstudent: But not for ielts\nstudent: 44107.0\nteacher: nooo..\nteacher: can you write it in words\nstudent: three out of ten\nstudent: Or three tenth\nteacher: ok so best for Ielts to use fairly basic fractions e.g. half/quarter/third./fifth......and then add little phrases to make it more specific e.g. 52% = _______  ________ half?\nteacher: three tenths = good by the way ...we'l lcome back to that one in a sec OK?\nstudent: Just over half?\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: yes perfect! hold on..\nteacher: so e.g. just over/under or slightly more than etc = good\nteacher: so therefore 30% could be ...?\nstudent: Mmm\nteacher: e.g. just __________  _________ _________?\nteacher: use the word 'third'!\nteacher: 30% = just under or just over?\nstudent: Just under\nteacher: OK so we could have now:\nteacher: Just under a third of visitors were satisfied with their experience\nteacher: one last step ...\nstudent: Hold on a sec\nteacher: ok!\nstudent: A third means 1/3?\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: and you need to say 'a third' by the way\nteacher: or 'one third'\nteacher: so e.g. just under a/one third of visitors\nstudent: Yes but can I say between 40% and 5O%?\nstudent: Or far under 50%?\nstudent: Or is it not clear?\nteacher: same with quarters/fifths (a/one is needed) but with half you don't need to say a/one (but you can if you want)\nteacher: do you mean for the 30% figure?\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: Well you can't say between 40% and 50% right?\nteacher: because it's less than 40% (?)\nstudent: May I?\nteacher: ?\nstudent: Yes sorry, I mean 20% and 40%\nteacher: ah sorry:)\nstudent: Or 25 and 35\nteacher: no this is unnecessarily vague\nstudent: Sorry\nteacher: if you have various figures in that range then maybe\nteacher: otherwise e.g. just under a third = much better\nstudent: So is it possible?\nstudent: Is it not bad?\nteacher: it's not wrong but it's not very good!\nteacher: just under a third = much much much better!\nteacher: or just 30%!!\nteacher: as in Jesusust  the number itself: 30%\nteacher: sorry just not Jesus!\nstudent: Ahahaha\nteacher: ready for last step?\nstudent: Born ready\nteacher: good answer\nstudent: Ahahaha\nteacher: so ....because this is a survey there are various verbs etc we can use to report the results\nteacher: apart from just saying e.g. people were satisfied....for example?\nteacher: e.g. in a survey you ask people questions right and they...?\nstudent: Answer\nteacher: yes you're completely right but sorry ...bad question...better verbs = e.g. said / reported / indicated OK?\nstudent: Ok I misunderstood\nteacher: no sorry my fault...So to summarise: we have a range of language we can use to explain the data ...hold on\nstudent: Claim\nteacher: yes claim = great!\nstudent: May I use that?\nteacher: yes!\nstudent: Ok perfect\nteacher: so e.g. different language to describe the percentages e.g. changing them into fractions\nteacher: different words to descrive survey results e.g. report/claim/say\nteacher: different words for the exact topic e.g. visit/experience/\nteacher: renovation\nteacher: all you have to do is mix all these up in grammatically accurate sentences and you'll get a great score !!\nteacher: easy right?\nstudent: Just under one third of people claim that they were satisfied\nteacher: yes very good - but use the past simple\nstudent: Claimed?\nteacher: yes\nstudent: Ok yes\nteacher: Next time Liam we'll practice this language a bit more and I'll ask you to decide on the main points/how to connect stuff together OK?\nstudent: Perfect, thanks\nteacher: OK I'll catch up with you in the week - thanks a lot bye\nstudent: thank you, bye!",

USe the word third and a little phrase to show if it's a bit more or less if you can\nstudent: Just under one third\nteacher: ye great wel ldone!\nteacher: by the way if you're not sure exactly then your word 'approximately' from before was good\nteacher: So looking back at the charts....tell me about coal in Australia in 2000!\nteacher: i'll wait...no rush!\nstudent: Coal generated 25 units of electricity in France in 2000\nstudent: Or\nteacher: sorry look at the Australia one\nstudent: oh,\nstudent: Sorry\nstudent: We\nteacher: but your France one was correct\nstudent: Coal generated 130 units of electricity in Australia in 2000\nstudent: Or\nstudent: 130 units of electricity were generated from coal in Australia in 2000\nteacher: yes that's great Emily ...can you try a use a fraction?\nteacher: what's it closer to half/two thirds/three quarters?\nstudent: Coal generated just over th\nstudent: Three quarters\nteacher: yes ok good so: 'Coal generated more than three quarters of electricity in Australia in 2000' = good\nstudent: Ok, I s\nstudent: see\nteacher: ok Emily another step....in Ielts it's good if you show in words themeaning of the numbers and not just a list of numbers do you see?\nteacher: so for example the fact that coal generated such a big proportion of electricity means that coal was very...?\nstudent: Important?\nstudent: Important source\nteacher: yes great! was important/was an important source\nteacher: hold on ...\nteacher: so: in Ielts you can use a two parts to give the information: one to example the meaning and one to give the data OK? In other words, Coal was ......It generated....(can you complete these?)\nteacher: as two sentences\nstudent: Coal was an important source. It generated three quarters of electricity in Australia in 2000.\nteacher: Yes ok that's the idea = good\nteacher: hold on...\nteacher: Can you join these two sentences together? You need to delete one word and slightly change another.(both in the middle)..can you do it?\nstudent: Coal was an important source which generated three quarters of electricity in Australia in 2000\nteacher: ah! yes this is possible:) ....for data like this in Ielts try the following: Coal was an important source, generating more than three quarters of electricity.\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: OK? A very common and useful structure that looks good (fluent)\nstudent: Okey\ud83d\ude0a\nteacher: OK Emily try that structure for nuclear power for both pie charts for FRance OK?!\nteacher: Hold on sorry - too difficult wait!\nstudent: 555555you know\ud83d\ude02\nteacher: So...! Before you said: 15 units of electricity was produced from nuclear power in France in 1980. (=good!) Now do a second part to link this with the situation in in 2000\nteacher: OK?!\nteacher: I mean another sentence...\nteacher: Is the link (i.e. first it was 15 units then it was 126) a contrast (so words like 'but or 'while' might be useful) or is just another thing (so 'and' might be OK)?\nteacher: sorry to interrupt - just carry on if you like\nstudent: Ok\nstudent: Umm\nstudent: Can I use\nteacher: you ok? don't answer if you've nearly finished!! otherwise I'll help!\nstudent: 15 units of electricity were produced from nuclear power in France in 1980, which was less than in 2000 when 126 units of electricity were produced.\nteacher: OK thanks Emily....it was a complicated question perhaps and you've given a complicated answer!\nstudent: Yes, I was just thinking about the question\nteacher: hold on...!\nstudent: 555555.0\nteacher: So let's keep it simple...( I don't mean easy I mean clear!)...\nteacher: hol don\nteacher: hold on\nteacher: So if we say: In 1980 nuclear power accounted for only 15 units of electricity but in 2000 it was the most important source, generating almost three quarters of the total. .\nteacher: OK? so quite simple really - just linked with 'but'\nstudent: Ah I\nstudent: See\nteacher: ok thanks - Emily have you practised beginning sentences with 'while' before?\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: so 'while' has two meanings right? One = at the same time and the other = ?\nstudent: And I have a question\nteacher: yes please go ahead\nstudent: And another is ...  the same thing but different number\nstudent: Different year\nteacher: OK sorry did you have a different question? The while' question = one meaning is at the same time the and the other meaning = 'but'\nstudent: Ah\nstudent: My question is\nstudent: Ah ok*\nstudent: My question is\nteacher: yeeess?\nstudent: Can I use whereas\nstudent: Instead of while\nstudent: While\nteacher: yes 'whereas' is good too\nstudent: Does 'whereas' have 2 meanings, the same as while?\nteacher: Hold on a sec...\nteacher: So while has two meanings yes - one for time and one for contrast ....whereas has only one meaning (for contrast) BUT it is for two different things so e.g. My brother likes chocolate whereas I prefer crisps\nteacher: so in fact in this example we only have one thing - coal - so while is ok but whereas isn't ...OK?\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: but you could say : Coal was the most important source in 2000 while/whereas in France nuclear power (both fine because we have two things )\nteacher: OK thanks Emily - some hard stuff today - well done!\nteacher: I'll catch up with you in the week and give you some easier stuff too OK? bye!\nstudent: Ok\nstudent: Thank you, Mr. Patel\nstudent: Bye",
    "teacher: Hi Alexandra all ok? Sorry for delay - connection problwm\nstudent: Hi Ms. Rodriguez\nstudent: I\u2019m fine\nstudent: And you?\nteacher: Yes fine thanks\nteacher: Did you have  a chance to look at the sentences?\nstudent: Yes\nstudent: In 1980 Australia had 50% of its electricity produced from coal.  Coal was an important source, generating around half of electricity in Australia in 1980.  Fifty per cent of electricity was generated from coal in Australia in 1980.  Australia produced 50 per cent of electricity from coal in 1980.  Coal generated half of electricity in Australia in 1980. Coal was a significant fuel source, generating half of electricity in Australia.  By 2000, coal was the most important source for generating electricity.  The proportion of electricity from coal in Australia was half in 1980 and rose to three quarters in 2000\nteacher: Ok! Hold on...\nstudent: Again\nstudent: In 1980 Australia had 50% of its electricity produced from coal.  Coal was an important source, generating around half of electricity in Australia in 1980.  Fifty per cent of electricity was generated from coal in Australia in 1980.  Australia produced 50 per cent of electricity from coal in 1980.  Coal generated half of electricity in Australia in 1980.

The proportion of electricity from coal in Australia was half in 1980 and rose to three quarters in 2000\nteacher: Ok thanks Alexandra - you've basically done really well there - can you try the first one again for me?f\nteacher: You need to follow first word with a verb\nstudent: Ok\nstudent: Australia produced half of electricity from coal in 1980\nteacher: Yes great well done\nteacher: Ok so youve git a variety of correct structures there\nstudent: Yeh\nteacher: Alexandra can i ask you a slightly different question now - hold on\nteacher: In your overview fir these charts what information would you include? Just use really simple keywords if you like to tell me\nteacher: Remember it's normally only two or three really big things\nteacher: You've practised this in class a bit right?\nstudent: Yes\nstudent: Highest , lowest\nteacher: Ok great so take a minute and just think - whats the really big thing ot\nteacher: Or things you need to say\nteacher: In the overview\nstudent: In Australia, the most important fuel source was coal\nteacher: Ok great anything else?\nstudent: In France, the least important fuel source was hydro power\nteacher: Ok thanks hold on a sec\nstudent: Both in 1980 and in 2000\nteacher: Ok Alexandra do do they teach you to include the lowest thing always? Is there anything you need to say about france thats more i.portant?\nstudent: Um\nteacher: Ok well if you say that coal was the most important fuel in Aus tralia then in france?\nstudent: Nuclear power was an important source in France in 2000\nteacher: Ok yes that's a more important poi g to make for France here\nteacher: Point\nstudent: But in France in 1980, natural gas was an important source\nstudent: Ah I see\nteacher: Yes but overall the main point is that both countries rely on one fuel you see?\nstudent: Yes\nstudent: But I\u2019m not sure about France\nstudent: Because the biggest source in France was not the same\nteacher: Well i guess thst in 1980 france relied on a variety of sources right?\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: BUT by 2000 tbis had co.plety changed and overall tbe biggest thing that had changed was NOT that gas was less important BUT that nuclear power wasBY FAR the MOST IMPORTANT SOURCE.ost\nteacher: Sorry for crazy typing!\nteacher: Is it clear enough?!\nstudent: U\nstudent: Umm\nstudent: It\u2019s clear\nteacher: Sure?!\nstudent: Do you mean we have to focus on the source that made up the biggest proportion in France?\nstudent: In 2000\nteacher: There are various changes it's true BUT relatively speaking it's the biggest thing\nstudent: Because in 1980 the proportion was not much different\nstudent: Right\nteacher: Yes because of my last comment\nstudent: Oh\nstudent: Oh ok\nteacher: If you imagine this info in a bar chart itmight be easier to see tbd relative diffetence and changes\nstudent: Now, I got this point\nteacher: Ok great!\nteacher: Can i ask you to try an intro for these charts Alexandra?\nstudent: Ok, I\nstudent: The charts illustrate fuel sources for generating electricity in France and in Australia both in 1980 and in 2000\nteacher: Thanks Alexandra yes pretty good! Give me a sec\nstudent: Fuel sources are divided into coal, oil, natural gas, hydro power and nuclear power\nteacher: Ok so two things ....number one\nteacher: Better if you say the charts illustrate the significance of different fuel sources\nstudent: Ah ok\nteacher: Or e.g. the contribution of different fuel sources\nteacher: These are a bit clearer\nstudent: Ah ok\nteacher: Or...you could also say ...illustrate the proportion of electricity generated from different\nteacher: Fuels\nteacher: Number two....you can find a way of including the fuels in the same sentence ok?\nteacher: For exames brackets -do you see?\nteacher: Sorry...for example in brackets\nstudent: Oh\nstudent: []\nteacher: Hold on\nstudent: This\nstudent: [ ]\nteacher: Sorry go ahead\nstudent: No.\nstudent: I just said brackets like [ ] this\nstudent: 555.0\nteacher: Ok so you could say...illustrate the role of different fuel sources (coal, gas...) in the production of electricity\nteacher: Include the names of the other fuels too!\nteacher: Is that clear?\nstudent: Ahh ok\nstudent: Yes it\u2019s clear\nstudent: Thank\nstudent: You\nteacher: Ok great so....could you try to tell me about gas and hydrpower in Australia in 1980?!\nteacher: Do you think it's better to do it in one sentence ortwo??!\nteacher: Or better would one sentence be ok?\nteacher: Better question i mean\nstudent: In France in 1980 natural gas generated the least electricity, only 5 units, but hydro power produced the most electricity, 25 units.\nteacher: Ah! Sorrh can you do it for these two fuels for Australia?!\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: Would yoh put these together for france? Why not?\nteacher: Because there is no obvious connection right?\nteacher: But in Australia...tbere is!\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: Ok...\nstudent: In France,\nteacher: No australia!\nstudent: Ah sorry\nstudent: 5555.0\nteacher: No problem):\nstudent: In Australia in 1980, 20 units of electricity were produced from natural gas, the same as from hydro power\nstudent: the same proportion as\nteacher: Ok thanks Alexandra hold on...\nteacher: Yes ok pretty good....you could use your structure you just need to say: ...from natural gas, the same as....\nteacher: In other words add a comma and then 'the' ok?\nteacher: But yes good and good to put similar things together in ielts task 1 right?\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: Ok thanks Alexandra speak to you soon!\nstudent: Ok thank you so much",
    "teacher: Hi Emily how are you? Ok?\nstudent: fine thanks\nteacher: Ok great- by the way is Maria a short form for Sophia Rodriguez in speaking?\nstudent: yes it is\nteacher: Ok yes not surprising i guess!\nteacher: Ok so you have the museum pie charts right?\nstudent: yes!\nteacher: Ok so....could you try an intro for them please?!\nteacher: Take a minute....and show me your idea....ok\nstudent: Both charts illustrate different visitors' reactions to Ashdown museum before and after its renovation\nteacher: Ok thanks Emily hold on...\nteacher: Yes pretty good actually! The big idea is fine definitely...Just a couple of small things...so can you write it again with tbe following changes: delete one 'tbe' and change 'at' and 'his' ok?! d\nteacher: Sorry 'the'\nteacher: Ahhh sorry Emily no ..your 'the' is fine actually but you need to delete 'of' ok?\nstudent: Both charts illustrate different reactions to Ashdown museum before and after  the renovation\nstudent: both the charts?\nstudent: sorry\nstudent: visitors' reactions\nteacher: Ok thanks so...Botb charts illustrate the different reactions to Ashdown museum before and after its renovation = good\nstudent: super\nteacher: Look at this pattern: reply answer reaction etc TO something ok?\nstudent: it's strange\nteacher: Not for me!\nstudent: ahahha\nstudent: understood\nteacher: Ok):\nteacher: Also...\nteacher: Common mistake = most/both etc + of\nteacher: If you say of you need to add 'the'\nstudent: Is it fine to say 'both of the charts'\nstudent: ?\nteacher: So either most OR most of the but NEVER just most of\nteacher: So most people OR most of the people but NOT most of people.... ok?\nstudent: got it\nstudent: thanks\nteacher: Ok good- but... one more question....for ielts in task 2 for example what do you normallt need- most people or most of the people?\nstudent: most people\nstudent: or both\nteacher: Ok yes good....why?\nteacher: No not both!\nstudent: ahahah sorry\nteacher: (:\nstudent: I don't know why, I never use 'most of the people'\nteacher: Ah ok! Well if you say 'the people....' i expect you to tell me about a particular group of people you see?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: But normally in your esday you're just talkjng in general\nteacher: Essay i mean\nstudent: yes\nteacher: So a common mistake is using lots of 'the' all the time when you don't need it\nteacher: Including for italians!\nteacher: Anyway....intro was good thanks...hold on...\nteacher: What about the overview Emily? Have a go ...!\nteacher: I'll wait ok?\nstudent: ok\nstudent: you mean conclusion right?\nteacher: Yes\nteacher: Just the really big thing(s)\nteacher: Usually with no numbers\nteacher: I mean the main point\nstudent: We can conclude that people who visited the museum after its refurbishment are\nstudent: ....\nstudent: after that is it better if I write the information in general?\nteacher: Yes...\nstudent: like '...are more satisfied'\nteacher: Yes for example\nstudent: than the visitors in the years before\nteacher: Yes ok ...again , pretty good you've got the big idea clearly expressed\nstudent: thanks\nteacher: A couple of small things...\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Dont say ' we can conclude'- just say it!\nteacher: Use past simple...\nteacher: I.e. 'were' more satisfied\nteacher: And finally....change some of the words if possible using synonyms and different phrases like we did last week\nstudent: but for example\nstudent: if I say 'we can see...' then I have to use the present simle\nstudent: simple\nstudent: ?\nstudent: even if I used the past tense in my essay\nteacher: Yes ...we can see thd charts now BUT when you talk aboug the actual information in the charts its (normally) in the past ok? ...maybe change : people, satisfied and refurbishment ok? And....show me the whole conclusion again ok?\nstudent: ok\nstudent: people who visited the museum after its regeneration were more pleased than the visitors in the years before\nstudent: I'm not sure if I can use regeneration as a synonym\nteacher: Um...good idea but not quite right here I'm afraid....maybe for e.g an atea of a city or a whe industry...\nteacher: Sorry...area of a city...or whole industry\nstudent: yes I see\nstudent: because it's the same thing in Italian\nteacher: But e.g. pleased with their visit = good idea\nteacher: You would need to say tbat it shows information on number of visitors too ok?\nteacher: Oh no sorry we're on conclusion not intro...!\nstudent: don't worry\nteacher: Ok Emily so if we have the intro and tbe conclusion tben we need to divide the main body into two paragraphs I'd  say for this one...\nteacher: One paragraph on positive responses and tben one on less positive feedback\nteacher: Seem logical to you?\nstudent: sure\nstudent: but usually I start from the main features, not from the positive things\nstudent: is it a bad idea?\nteacher: Um...ok maybe it depends...hold on\nteacher: Maybe if the categories are not really connected but here thete is do you see?\nteacher: They are connected i mean\nstudent: no I mean\nstudent: for example\nteacher: Yes...\nstudent: in this case the most significant information is about dissatisfied people\nteacher: Um...is it?\nteacher: Why?\nteacher: Do you mean because it's the biggezt proportion?\nteacher: Oh no sorry it isnt is it? So why then?\nstudent: because it is the information that has changed the most\nteacher: Ah i see ...hold on\nstudent: (I don't know if my English grammar is correct here)\nteacher: No its ok! 'Has changed' = better...Well....if you divided the two paragraphs like tbat i think it woumd be quite complicated....\nteacher: Hold on...\nstudent: ok\nstudent: so it's better to make a logical distinction\nteacher: Its a bit difficult to go through it right now and we're going to have to stop now but...yes i think i know what you mean with logical distinction and i agree ...we'll come back to it soon ok!\nstudent: sure thanks!\nteacher: Ok cheers Emily speak to you soon\nteacher: Bye!\nstudent: bye thanks",
    "teacher: Hello Sophia Reynolds, is that you?!\nstudent: Yes, I\u2019m here :)\nteacher: OK hi again! So Sophia Reynolds as we said I'm going to give you some Part 3 style speaking quesrtions...\nstudent: OK\nteacher: Just try and answer as naturally as you can ... as if you were speaking i guess! OK....here goes....\nstudent: OK\nteacher: OK great so...the topic is 'Work' and here comes the first question...\nteacher: Is job satisfaction more important than salary when choosing a job?\nstudent: Personally,\nstudent: I think job satisfication isn\u2019t more important than salary\nteacher: OK...so you're going to give me some more right? Like a reason/example etc....?\nstudent: Yes\nstudent: For example\nteacher: ok sorry I'll wait...!\nstudent: If you really like your job, your colleages\nstudent: But your salary is lower than standard\nstudent: And it affects your life\nstudent: Such as you don\u2019t have enough money for your children\u2019s education\nteacher: OK Sophia Reynolds ...I'm not entirely clear on your idea here to be honest...do you mean that you need  a minimum salary to be able to support yourself/meet your basic needs\nteacher: ?\nteacher: Ah sorry yes....you've given a specific example ...that's good\nstudent: So you have to balance between satification and salary\nstudent: Sorry Ms. Rodriguez.\nstudent: Now, my internet is not working\nstudent: So the message is delayed\nteacher: OK don't worry - I'm still getting it in the end! I'm happy to carry on if you are!\nteacher: OK?\nstudent: Ok thank you\nteacher: OK no problem - so your example was OK in the end....maybe you get use the word 'might'...hold on a sec\nstudent: OK\nteacher: So for example you could say: 'IF you don't earn enough to meet basic needs then job satisfaction might not be enough'\nstudent: Ah, I see\nteacher: Other similar words: may/could/can.....OK? THese can look good\nteacher: in writing too in IELTS\nteacher: because the points you're making may not always be true you see\nteacher: your use of the word 'balance' was good ...hold on....\nteacher: you can say: have a balance between two things OR balance (as verb) + two things (without the word 'between' )\nteacher: average' would be a good word to use for your point as well\nstudent: Do you mean balance satisfaction and salary?\nstudent: Ah I see\nteacher: as in 'your salary is below average'\nteacher: Next question: 'What skills are needed to get a good job nowadays?'\nstudent: Nowadays I think\nstudent: one needs a lot of skills\nstudent: Communication\nstudent: IT, or computer skills\nstudent: And also languages\nteacher: THanks - good examples (communication,language and IT skills)\nteacher: Say one more thing about any or all of those OK?\nstudent: And specific skills\nstudent: Ok\nstudent: Because nowadays\nstudent: The world has changed\nstudent: Everybody can contact one another easily\nstudent: But if you don\u2019t have communication skills\nstudent: You can\u2019t understand each other\nstudent: You\u2019ll make mistakes at work\nstudent: For example\nstudent: If your boss asks you to improve sugar processing but you don\u2019t understand and you think your boss is allowing you to change the process as you like\nstudent: It can lead to a big problem in your company\nteacher: OK thanks Sophia Reynolds - you've developed your point there, which is the right thing to try to do - well done....hold on a sec...\nstudent: OK\nteacher: OK Sophia Reynolds so I'm just thinking about verbs now...have a look at the folllowing ecamples and choose one and write a change if you can OK?...You said: \u2018The world change\u2019 \u2013 can you think about the verb tense here and write it again? You said :\u2019you\u2019ll make a mistake\u2019 \u2013 can you change the \u2018will\u2019?! Think about the verb tenses in your sentence beginning: For example, if your boss\u2026\u2019  And the verb tense in your final sentence\u2026 ? \u2018So it \u2026\u2019\nstudent: The world is changing\nstudent: You would make a mistake\nstudent: If your boss asks you\nteacher: OK Sophia Reynolds so...maybe the chane happened in the past right? BUT you're talking about the present result so .you need...the present perfect! In other words: the world ______  changed?\nstudent: The world has changed\nstudent: Changed\nteacher: Yes good ! IF your boss asks you is OK (but with the 's') ..what about 'allow'?\nstudent: Allows\nteacher: sorry I'll tell you this one: its 'allowing' : 'you think you're boss is allowing you to...'\nstudent: Ah, i see\nteacher: And the 'will' example?\nteacher: You will make a mistake...?\nteacher: What modal verb could you use instead?\nstudent: You would make a mistake?\nstudent: You could make a mistake?\nteacher: yes good!\nstudent: \ud83d\ude05\nteacher: Because if you don't understand you won't ALWAYS make a mistake\nstudent: OK\nteacher: but if you say 'will' it's like it always happens you know?\nstudent: Ah I see\nteacher: so 'might' or 'could' or 'may' (more formal) are all good here\nstudent: Ah I see\nteacher: what about 'can'?\nteacher: you can make a mistake?\nstudent: You could make a mistake\nteacher: yes exactly - so again: could/may/might all good BUT 'can' = not possible!\nteacher: ONe final question Sophia Reynolds: What jobs are most valuable to society?\nstudent: I think the job that is most valuable to society is a teacher\nteacher: :)\nstudent: Because the students who are the future of society are taught by teacher\nstudent: I mean\nstudent: If a teacher teaches good things to students\nstudent: These students will be effective people\nteacher: You said: \u2018The world change\u2019 \u2013 can you think about the verb tense here and write it again? You said :\u2019you\u2019ll make a mistake\u2019 \u2013 can you change the \u2018will\u2019?! Think about the verb tenses in your sentence beginning: For example, if your boss\u2026\u2019  And the verb tense in your final sentence\u2026 ? \u2018So it \u2026\u2019\nteacher: Oh sorry...hold on!\nteacher: Just the following !! ...Thanks Sophia Reynolds \u2013 good point and good passive (\u2018are taught\u2019) and good to use \u2018effective\u2019!\nteacher: and good phrase:'the future of society''\nstudent: Thank you;)\nstudent: OK\nteacher: OK thanks we'll stop there - sorry if you had technical problems I hope it was still useful ...see you tomorrow\nstudent: Thank you for today, Ms. Rodriguez.\nteacher: OK bye!\nstudent: See you tmr",
    "teacher: Hi Sarah Smith is that you?!\nteacher: Yes sorry it's you LilySmith22\nstudent: ahahah yes\nstudent: easy one\nteacher: Yes! OK Sarah Smith so....like we said i'll just ask you some part 3 style questions and you can answer as if you were speaking OK? Try to say at least a couple of things about each quesrtion (e.g. a reason/example or whjatever) and i'll wait for you to finish...Ok first question coming up\nstudent: ok\nteacher: OK so the topic is 'Work' and question: IS job satisfaction more important than salary when choosing a job?'\nstudent: I believe so, because if you had a high salary but a job that you didn't really enjoy, it would be difficult for you to be happy\nstudent: It's important to do the work that we can enjoy because it is our main occupation during the day\nteacher: OK thanks Sarah Smith...maybe another sentence would be good here ....to add support ...like a specific case (as in soemthing that wouldn't be enjoyable if you see what i mean\nstudent: that's the reason why after high school it would be better to make a conscious (I know the spelling is wrong) decision\nstudent: you mean for example a subject?\nteacher: OK thanks\u2013 so good = \u2018high salary\u2019 and \u2018main occupation\u2019 = good idea (maybe e.g. it occupies the majority of our time\u2019 = more normal here) ...hold on...\nstudent: I see\nteacher: well an ecample of a job with the features you mention - high salary but (perhaps not enjoyable...\nstudent: ah ok\nteacher: because it gives you a chance to use more detailed language you see\nstudent: for example a business man\nstudent: has a lot of responsibilities\nstudent: but it depends on people\nstudent: depends\nteacher: And it's not enjoyable as a result?\nteacher: because it's...?\nteacher: stressful for example?\nstudent: For some people being a doctor can be not enjoyable because the lives of young people and adults depend on him\nstudent: lives\nteacher: OK thanks some specific examples often good idea - hold on a sec\nteacher: Sarah Smith, look at following and make a change if you can: You said: I believe so, because if you had a high salary but a job that you don't really enjoy...\u2019 Are the two verb tenses OK here?  By the way: spelling = conscious and responsibility  Depend \u2018from\u2019? Lives = good for plural\nstudent: the plural of life is lives??\nteacher: yes!\nstudent: English people=crazy\nstudent: ahahah\nteacher: :)\nstudent: I'm joking\nteacher: well you might be right!\nstudent: we don't know\nstudent: ah but are you waiting for me?\nstudent: waiting\nteacher: er yes sorry ...for the verb tense question...and depend 'from'\nteacher: ?\nstudent: sorry\nstudent: depend on\nteacher: no worrries!\nteacher: on on on on on on on on !!!\nstudent: ahahahha\nteacher: sorry unnecessary\nstudent: I'm really bad with preposition\nteacher: and yes before you ask - always\nstudent: ahahaha\nteacher: well it's not only you so don't be hard on yourself!\nstudent: I was writing the question for this answer\nstudent: no it's the reality\nteacher: ha\nteacher: I can imagine\nstudent: English people are too lucky\nstudent: troppo\nteacher: you mean 'very' right?!\nstudent: maybe... ahaha\nstudent: yes I mean 'too' in an Italian way\nteacher: yes we can never be sure....Ok Sarah Smith you used 'had' and don't enjoy' - is this OK in one conditional sentence?\nstudent: it depends on what comes after\nstudent: or before\nstudent: the past with would\nstudent: the present with will\nteacher: well no not really because you can't switch between 1st and 2nd because it's either real or not real you see\nstudent: ahhh\nstudent: sure\nteacher: so if you say 'had' you have to follow it with ...? don't or didn't?\nstudent: didn't\nteacher: ok good!\nteacher: You can switch between 2nd and 3rd because this is about time you see?\nstudent: and then I must use would\nteacher: Yes exactly\nstudent: I see\nstudent: When can I use a mixed one?\nteacher: OK next question if you're ready: Whcat skills are need to get a good job these days? ah hold on\nteacher: are needed' sorry hold on hold on\nstudent: leadership\nteacher: Well for example: I would be rich (now so 2nd) if I had studied medicine (in the past so 3rd) OK?\nstudent: can I say 'if I studied medicine I would be rich'?\nstudent: I never understood the difference\nteacher: If you mean you 're imagining beginning to study medicine NOW then yes\nteacher: the If i had studied = I didn't study it but if i had .....(often a regret you know?)\nteacher: you understand 'regret' right ?\nteacher: like I wish i had/hadn't but I didn't\nstudent: ah so if I'm a babysitter and I have already made the main decision of my life, I have to use the 3rd, right?\nstudent: yes regret\nteacher: yes exactly...so I wish I wasn't a babysitter (NOW) I wish I had studied medicine or whatever\nteacher: in the past\nstudent: because I can't change things now\nteacher: yes exactly!\nstudent: ahhhhh\nstudent: thanks\nteacher: so 3rd = unreal past\nteacher: and 2nd = unreal present/future\nstudent: thanks a lot\nteacher: ok no problem - Sarah Smith keep going with the skills if you're ready\nteacher: the skills question I mean\nstudent: yes I am\nteacher: ok...\nteacher: you OK?\nteacher: You mentioned 'leadership'....? sorry if you're typing i'll wait...\nstudent: in my opinion, one of the most significant skills needed to get a job is leadership because without this one it's impossible to....\nstudent: I don't know how to explain\nstudent: in Italian neither\nstudent: do not be submissive?\nteacher: HA! Well I guess that 'leadership skills' are only really essential in some jobs right ?\nstudent: it's not the exact word\nteacher: Um...you mean self-confidence maybe?\nstudent: I think in the majority of them\nstudent: yes good idea\nteacher: Yes I think this makes more sense (certainly to my English brain)\nteacher: a common idea (and good)\nstudent: in my Italian brain too\nteacher: Maybe more of a quality than a skills but don't worry too much!\nteacher: OK any other ideas?\nstudent: let me think\nteacher: ok...i'll wait!\nstudent: another important factor could be having some knowledge of a specific area of study\nteacher: OK....when you say 'remarkable' you mean...?\nstudent: important\nteacher: ah ok - that's better or e.g. valuable maybe?\nteacher: so 'specialist knowledge' = good phrase here OK?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: always good to give specific example if possible so...can you think of a particular area?\nstudent: for example a person with a degree in economics will have more chance of being hired than another person without a degree\nstudent: in a specific company\nteacher: OK thanks so...a candidate for a job with a degree in economics will have more chance of being hired than...\nteacher: fine\nteacher: or e.g. more likely to be hired = also possible\nstudent: so good\nstudent: so better\nteacher: Thanks! OK Sarah Smith we'll have to stop in a minute but...good skills to mention might include e.g. communication skills/IT skills etc\nstudent: yes\nteacher: BEcause they're related to the world of work nowadays do you see?\nstudent: languages\nstudent: yes I see\nteacher: yes good example!\nteacher: give me a sentence with that one if you like\nstudent: which one\nteacher: languages...\nteacher: cos it was your idea!\nstudent: it's also important to develop language skills to improve communication with other agencies and colleagues\nteacher: ok thanks! 'colleagues'/'develop skills' 'important to' = all good!\nteacher: not 'the' though\nstudent: yes sorry\nteacher: That's OK! we'll call it a day I guess  thanks  Sarah Smith see you tomorrow....\nstudent: thank you",
    "student: Hi Ms. Patel\nstudent: still there??\nteacher: Hi yes i'm here Alexandra - really sorry for delay...\nstudent: No worries, at the moment I have a lot of free time hehe\nteacher: Yes I guess so...is the 'c' word something we should mention or do you want to avoid it completely?!\nstudent: I'm ok with the 'c' word ;)\nteacher: OK well....can I ask - are you allowed to g o out at the moment?\nstudent: How are you in England? I haven't heard the news today but until yesterday you could have a normal life, couldn't you?\nteacher: Yes more or less - but the current advice is to avoid social contact so things are slowing down fast...many entertainment venues are closing for example\nteacher: it's only a matter of time before more places are forced to shut down i think....\nstudent: We are allowed to go out to the supermarket, pharmacy or to your work place. There are police stopping people and asking where they are going... it's very weird :(\nteacher: Wow yeah that's pretty heavy - as I say that's definitely on the horizon here sooner rather than later...\nteacher: although weirdly the schools are sti;l open!\nstudent: I don't understand why they keep schools open having the experiences of Italy and now Spain\nstudent: There are so many new cases every day... It's scary\nteacher: Yeah I think the rationale is that: Stop key workers from having childcare commitments/prevent vulnerable grandparents from being exposed through providing childcare\nteacher: Yes I guess that the vast majority of young(ish) people are relatively safe in the event of contracting the illness right...but of course it's very worrying for older people\nstudent: Yes, here we had that situation at the beginning when they closed schools but parents kept working... Now most parents are working from home so they can look after their children and leave grandparents alone\nteacher: Yes I see...intersting that they expect parents to be able to look after kids AND work at the same time!\nteacher: The situation at our school is pretty catastrophic to be honest...perhaps the end!\nstudent: Yes, impossible for a lot of parents... especially because children have a lot of homework to do and they need help. My nephew is 10 years old and has to do 5 hours of homework a day, can you imagine?\nteacher: Yes - that's a tough change to make for everyone! I'll be in the same boat in a couple of weeks I'm sure...\nteacher: Although I'll be effectively unemployed in fact from next week probably\nstudent: ohh really bad the news about your school... I guess there are no students travelling from their countries at the moment?\nteacher: Yes that's right and the vast majority who were here have left early while they can still get flights I'll have to scratch around getting any online work I can\nstudent: It's going to be very difficult if the situation doesn't change very soon\nteacher: Yes, like lots of businesses the school can't survive more than a few months without income\nteacher: not with the overheads\nstudent: I thought of online teaching, you can always do that. But if people can't work they don't have the money to pay for online classes... uffff hard\nteacher: so all the staff will probably be laid off\nteacher: Yes that's true I guess - that's what everyone's doing but as you say the demand won't necessarily be there right now - we'l see!\nteacher: I'm planning lots of quality time at my allotment...\nstudent: That sounds like a very good plan\nstudent: Here you wouldn't be able to go to your allotment either!\nteacher: THat's definitely over the top! I think that would never happen in the UK!\nteacher: I've decided that allotments are quintessentially British - i.e. kind of shared/communnal but not really the perfect liberal compromise\nteacher: I mean controlled social spaces you know?\nstudent: Sorry, I don't understand what you mean...\nstudent: Quintessentially??\nteacher: Oh right....like the perfect example of seomthing\nteacher: as in allotments are a perfect example of Britishness\nteacher: or embody typical British values or whatever\nstudent: ahh I see\nteacher: as in they provoke the feeling you should be sociable with your allotment 'neighbours' but there's no demand for you to be 'friends'!\nteacher: you can maintain priVACY/DISTANCE\nteacher: that's why British people like board games so much e.g. shared activity but with clear rules so that everything's under control! (maybe - just a theory - not an original one)\nstudent: I understand, and I see here there are a lot of places where we could be around people keeping the 2 meters distance that doctors recommend but we can't go anywhere... same in Italy\nstudent: haha I like the board games example\nteacher: OK you mean (?) you should be able to go out as long as you stay 2 metres away from people\nteacher: as in: Why don't they let us?\nstudent: That is what we have to do when we go to the supermarket or to the pharmacy\nteacher: Yes right - that must be strange - especially in Spain/Italy where you have less personal space - IN the UK 2 metres is almost normal anyway!\nteacher: There are lots of jokes in the media at the moment about that sort of thing i.e. it's the perfect excuse for BRitish people to feel less guilty about being...British! i.e. reserved etc\nstudent: But for example, there is a big avenue in front of my house where I could walk without getting too close to people but there is a police officer walking around (not all the time) asking people where they are going... If you go to the supermarket they ask you for the receipt... It's crazy! I go to the supermarket every day to buy something so that I have some fresh air at least for half an hour\nteacher: Wow - so if you live in a flat (do you?) you basically can't be outside at all really?\nstudent: Here there are soooo many jokes about everything... It's great because at least we laugh quite often...\nteacher: Yes you've got to laugh or...(you know the ending right?)\nstudent: yes!!! I'm not supposed to leave at all. I'm very lucky, I can see the sea from my sofa and I live alone but I'm very sorry for families who live in a small flat with little children\nstudent: Noooo, I don't know the ending! please, tell me...\nteacher: ..or you'd cry! Not really funny or clever - just wondered if you knew! Often we don't bother saying the second part like lots of idioms...\nteacher: Yes really tough as you say for people with toddlers etc I live in the middle of nowhere so I guess nobody can stop me from going for a walk where I am....\nstudent: haha we have something similar! 'Me r\u00edo por no llorar'\nteacher: OK nice - thanks! Exactly the same really...\nstudent: You are very lucky there in the middle of nowhere\nteacher: ya gotta laugh' is if you can imagine the quick spoken form of the phrase...\nteacher: Hey Alexandra do you read phonemic script by the way?\nteacher: As in you'd follow this right?: /j\u0259g\u0252(t)\u0259l\u0251\u02d0f/\nstudent: What is very nice is that there is a lot of free stuff available online, especially on Instagram. There are free fitness, dancing, cooking, photography, yoga classes... Everything to keep us doing something!! I have a diary to be able to remember all the activities I'd like to do ;)\nstudent: Sorry, I go back to your question\nteacher: Yes that's great - I guess we're luck to have the internet these days in this situation ...ok I'll wait..\nstudent: I don't know all the symbols but I recognise a lot of them\nstudent: Every time I check a word in the dictionary (very often) I have a look at the phonemic script\nteacher: OK I understand - well, can be useful I think - once you get used to it it's very quick - that's great you check in the dictionary\nstudent: Wait, do you check words in the dictionary?? or look up?\nteacher: the more i teach the more I focus on pronunciation to b ehonest\nteacher: you can say check or look up - both fine (and common)\nteacher: I guess 'chec' could imply you kinda know a bit already and 'look up' can suggest you know nothing you see?\nteacher: check' I mean\nteacher: A new phrasal verb by the way used by young people (but not by me) = 'search up'\nteacher: As in: I'll search it up on my phone' - sounds horrible to me but lots of kids are saying that now!\nstudent: I think it's very important (pronunciation). I always check it when I have doubts because it was difficult for me to make people understand me sometimes when I lived in England... Since I spent some time there the first time I went, I realised how important it is to know the correct pronunciation of words...\nstudent: I won't use search up then ;)\nteacher: Yes I think that's great you focused on that - I remember the small amount of time I heard you speaking you seemd to have very good pronunciation (especailly for a Spanish speaker - sorry that sounds like a back-handed compliment)\nstudent: ohh thank you! I try hard :)\nstudent: What does 'back-handed compliment' mean??\nteacher: Um...a compliment that could be understood as an insult\nstudent: hahah\nteacher: As in your pronuncation is good but only compared with other Spanish speakers who are generally terrible (and no I don't mean that entirely)\nteacher: ..but many Spaniards do need to focus more on pronunciation of course!\nstudent: I understand what you mean now\nteacher: It can be very frustrating if you don't do it fairly early on..\nstudent: I think it's our teachers' fault (teachers here). They don't care very much about it, here grammar seems to be very important\nteacher: Yes I'm sure you're right - I guess it'll change with the exposure to authentic speech on the internet etc\nteacher: it's definitely changed already in my expereince\nteacher: the average pronunciation of my younger students is better than 10 years ago for example\nteacher: cos they watch Netflix all the time...\nteacher: or youtube or whatever\nstudent: Yes, that's terrible. Every time I try to record a whatsapp message in English my phone doesn't get a word :(. When I do it in Spanish it works perfectly...\nteacher: Oh really? Its not because it's on the 'Spanish' setting is it? I'm sure you 're good enough to get a device to understand you no?\nstudent: Do you know what I am talking about? When you speak and your phone writes what you say...\nteacher: Yes yes I know\nstudent: Nooo, in English, I change the language when I want to do it in English\nteacher: Hey Alexandra did you notice my Spanish intefernce just not - seriously, when I put 'no' at the end of my sentence - that's not normal - it something i  retained from speaking Spanish years ago...\nteacher: cos it's more efficient\nstudent: haha no, I haven't realised until now that you said it. It's true that 'no' is much easier than 'isn't it' 'don't you', etc\nteacher: yes you know that in 50 years linguists predict that we will all say just 'innit?' in English (which currently is associated with lower class speakers)\nteacher: I say it for 'isn't it?' which is a little bit lower class (!) but some poeple say it for all question tags (which is definitely more frowned upon by snobs)\nstudent: I'd be very happy to adopt that lower class speakers' habit!! ;)\nteacher: Yes you'll be fine in 50 years!\nteacher: Ok Alexandra I guess that's an hour more or less right? I'm really sorry again about the delay today - I'll speak to you tomorrow at 13:15!\nstudent: It feels very artificial to me to use question tags, when I use them I feel very posh haha\nstudent: Yes, thank you very much! See you tomorrow :)\nteacher: Reaelly? That's funny! Well ,they do sound good fore most people so keep using them is my advice!\nteacher: Ok bye",
    "teacher: Hi Emily!\nstudent: Hi Mrs. Garcia!\nteacher: How are you today? Still stuck inside :(\nteacher: ?\nstudent: yes, here I am. I go to the shop every day to buy something, today I've bought tomatoes...\nstudent: How about you? Any changes in the UK?\nteacher: Um...not really anything specific....just more of the same and the sense of vague dread that everything slowly getting more serious...\nteacher: my other half is now working from home though\nstudent: good, you all should do the same soon\nstudent: My other half' sounds very nice. Is it common to use it?\nteacher: yes, it's pretty common\nteacher: a bit informal...but normal\nteacher: I guess it's a way of avoiding the whole 'wife'/'girlfriend' dilemma\nstudent: I understand. If I translate it, in Spanish it sounds very romantic\nstudent: It's funny how things sound too romantic or posh (as I told you yesterday) or rude... depending on your own language\nteacher: oh that's good! Maybe in the UK it can be associated with a long marriage (but as in a long-suffering spouse)  but only as a joke , not necessarily\nteacher: does that make sense? often as part of sarcastic BRitish humour you know?\nstudent: haha yes, it makes sense\nteacher: I found a good card for her birthday the other day - 'It's good to have found that special person I want annoy for the rest of my life.' Very British!\nstudent: hahahah very funny\nteacher: want TO annoy\nstudent: Did she like it?\nteacher: Yes of course - she has a good sense of humour!\nstudent: Nice\nteacher: A few little things you said yesterday Emily \u2013 just checking whether these minor things are \u2018errors\u2019 or \u2018slips\u2019 i.e. if you don\u2019t know the problem or you just forgot if you see what I mean:  Most of parents\u2026\u2026..  2 metres distance \u2026\u2026.  There is police\u2026\u2026.  I go back to your question\nteacher: choose any one you want and respond if you like/can!\nstudent: Yes, please. All of them!\nstudent: Most of parents.... I think it should be 'most parents'\nteacher: yes great - can you ever say: 'most of'?\nstudent: most of them??\nteacher: as in most of parents\nteacher: yes true that's possible\nstudent: not sure\nteacher: but NEVER most of parents\nstudent: why??\nteacher: EITHER most parents OR most of the parents\nstudent: ahhh I see\nteacher: because of is only used to precede 'the' ...OK yes you've got it\nteacher: a common mistake though\nstudent: Now I understand, thank you!\nteacher: and remember if we (English native speakers) CAN omit the article we usually do\nteacher: in other words 'most parents' much much more common than most of the parents\nstudent: ok\nstudent: 2-metre distance\nteacher: ok yes good...with a hypher/dash t be correct correct i.e. a 2-metre distance\nteacher: or obvoiusly a distance of 2 metres\nstudent: I see... but I always have doubts about it. I tend to say 2 (plural) something\nteacher: yes a common thing but...don't!\nteacher: So for example - how far from your house to the beach - how long does it take to walk there?\nstudent: It is 50 steps away\nteacher: Ha! OK so....it's a 30-second walk or whatever right?\nstudent: I see\nteacher: How long to fly to the UK?\nstudent: it's a 4-hour flight\nstudent: it sounds wrong\nteacher: OK great - sorry bad question at the moment ....\nteacher: sounds good to me though!\nstudent: ahhh great\nstudent: could we practise this a bit more?\nteacher: really common structure ...maybe a tiny bit more formal but really common as i say\nteacher: yes of course hold on...\nstudent: thanks\nteacher: so: a film that lasts 120 minutes.......a conflict that goes on for 6 years (e.g. WW11) ......a break at work but only five minutes!\nteacher: ?\nteacher: One more sorry....I was married for 5 years and it was a disaster\nstudent: About your question earlier, 'How far from your house to the beach?' Don't we need 'is' in that sentence??\nteacher: Yes you're right - I'm being lazy and writing in short form - sorry I guess it's the danger with this format!\nstudent: haha I see\nteacher: BUT having said that ....it IS used in speech too sometimes\nteacher: in a lazy way!\nteacher: IT's called ellipsis you know?\nteacher: Quite common to omit auxialiary verbs i.e. 'Been any where nice recently?'\nstudent: I understand but I'm not sure about how to add 'is' to that question.\nteacher: Ah you mean this one? Have you been anywhere nice?\nstudent: no, how far from your house to the beach?\nteacher: Or: How far is it from your house to the beach....Ah ok\nstudent: ahhh I need 'is it'\nteacher: yes this is common so for example: How far is it from London to Brighton?\nteacher: maybe sounds clumsy to you but that's what we say!\nteacher: NOT so much: What is the distance between....this is much more formal\nstudent: No, it sounds perfect but I was trying to do it without it...\nteacher: Yes I see!\nstudent: I was thinking about that formal way you just wrote about\nteacher: yes I imagined....!\nstudent: I'll go back to what we were doing\nteacher: not wrong but a bit weird in everyday speech\nteacher: i.e. Spanish!\nstudent: A 120-minute film\nteacher: with 's'?\nstudent: nooo sorry\nstudent: a 120-minute film\nteacher: that's OK! so: a two-hour film = good\nteacher: or 120-minute!\nstudent: a six-year conflict\nteacher: yes good\nstudent: it looks so weird to write and use dash...\nteacher: it's never too late....!\nstudent: a five-minute break\nteacher: yes good Hey Emily ...I realise now that yesterday you wanted to describe the situation as 'weird' but I accepted 'wired' cos it means like 'on edge' you know?\nstudent: Then if I write 'a five minute break', would it be wrong?\nteacher: Um well technically but in real life English people often leave it out\nteacher: the important thing is that you don't say (or write) the 's'\nstudent: Yes, sorry. I meant weird\nteacher: yes i get it now!\nstudent: My 5-year marriage was a disaster\nteacher: Yes great (or: my disastrous five-year marriage!)\nteacher: What about e.g. a ring that costs $1,000?\nstudent: Good! Thank you\nstudent: Shall we go back to yesterday's mistakes?\nteacher: yes sure!\nstudent: a one thousand-dollar ring\nteacher: yes good\nstudent: there is police\nstudent: Shall I say 'there are police everywhere'?\nteacher: yes!\nstudent: why?? is it like people?\nteacher: Hold on...\nteacher: So it's a bit difficult with groups/organisations sometimes...\nteacher: so for example some can be either e.g. a football team can be Manchester UNited is/are it depends\nteacher: if you mean as a company then....?\nteacher: as opposssed to a group of players\nteacher: ?\nstudent: I don't know... do you mean MU as a company??\nteacher: Yes so much much more common to say (for e.g. sports teams) Manchester UNited are ...(doing well or whatever)\nstudent: I see\nteacher: Sorry unclear hold on!\nteacher: BAsically, in normal speaking we refer to lots of things in the plural which in Spanish I think you'd use the singular for!\nteacher: E.g. teams/the government etc\nteacher: More formally we can sometimes use the singular e.g. 'the government is'\nstudent: It's hard to understand... So, do you say 'The government are...??\nteacher: It's a bit random to be honest...if we add certain words then sometimes the singular becomes more likely e.g. the fire service is...\nteacher: Yes we often say the government are...\nteacher: a bit less formal but common yes...like we're thinking of them as a bunch of people\nstudent: ohh I didn't know that...\nstudent: But I kind of get it haha\nteacher: No I can see it might seem a bit strange\nteacher: By the way I think the plural form is less common the USA\nteacher: in the US\nteacher: than in Britain\nstudent: No idea, I'll be more careful from now on when I talk about groups\nteacher: OK!\nstudent: Please, could you help me with a very simple sentence??\nteacher: yes of course...\nstudent: The first thing I do every morning is....\nstudent: to wash my face/ washing my face/ wash my face\nteacher: OK so....with or without 'to' doesn't matter - with 'to' = more formal\nteacher: if the verb is common then we use the verb i.e. the middle one is strange because we prefer the verb form in this cae\nteacher: case\nstudent: So we can say:\nstudent: is wash my face or is to wash my face??\nteacher: yes both are fine\nstudent: Great, thank you!\nstudent: And if I say\nstudent: The plan is...\nstudent: to go to the park/go to the park\nstudent: Again both are correct?? Is it the same structure??\nteacher: Um..here it sounds strange without 'to' - I'm afriad this just depends on each word...so with 'plan' we say e.g. I plan to go TO the park AND the plan is TO go to the park etc\nteacher: Sorry I plan TO go to the park\nstudent: Sorry, I don't get it... You don't say 'the plan is??\nteacher: BUT in informal lazy speaking you might hear people say 'the plan is go to the park...' but this is like ellipsis that I mentioned before you know?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Sorry...so in the vern and noun structure yes you need 'to' i.e. the plan is to go....AND we plan to go....\nteacher: you need 'is' I mean\nteacher: Ah sorry trying to type too fast! but is that clear?\nstudent: I undestand! thanks\nteacher: OK....\nstudent: I guess we have finished!\nteacher: One more quick one Emily.....the phrase: 'I have a doubt' or 'I doubt something' = much less common in Enlgish by the way ...MUch much more normal = I'm not sure about....\nteacher: OK?\nstudent: ahhhh I was translating from Spanish!!\nteacher: THat's ok! All right great so I'll b ein touch very soon about more classes OK? thanks Bye\nstudent: Yes please, I have a lot of free time now...\nstudent: Thank you very much\nteacher: yeah me too! see ya...\nstudent: See you!!",
    "teacher: Hi Nadia Kim - are you there?!\nstudent: Hi Mrs. Johnson\nteacher: Hi, how are you doing?\nstudent: How do you say 'passing the days'??\nstudent: Do you have an expression for that?\nteacher: Um...not really I guess the translation could be ...e.g. 'surviving' or 'getting by'\nstudent: Exactly that... surviving\nstudent: How about you?\nteacher: Well...surviving I guess! I'm at home now and basically 'social distancing' is the new norm\nteacher: So pretty limited\nteacher: also I hurt my knee which is annoying (poor me)\nstudent: Finally!!\nteacher: Yes finally\nteacher: although not enforced as yet....\nstudent: ohh yes, poor you! Is it serious?\nteacher: well I hope not - I've had a couple of operations before (sports injuries) but it might not be tat bad ...just gotta wait and see\nteacher: but I go a bit crazy without movement you know\nstudent: Hope you get better soon\nteacher: yeah thanks - it's OK - mind over matter - I;m serious you know? It's a good mental test\nteacher: as in it's the way you look at things right?\nstudent: Yes, I know what you mean... I feel the same. I just went to exercise a bit inside my building but we're not supposed to...\nteacher: not even inside?\nteacher: you mean on the stairs or something?\nstudent: no :(. I don't understand why not. I just talked to one of my neighbours and he told me (in a good way) that if I did it, everyone would do it too. And I really think that we could plan a half-hour walk for everyone during the day...\nstudent: a half-hour walk?\nteacher: a half-hour walk (you mean 30 minutes right?)\nstudent: hehe I see\nteacher: and how about a simlar phrase for 90 minutes? can iyou try it?\nstudent: we could have a ninety-minute walk\nstudent: ??\nteacher: yes fine thanks just checking!\nteacher: yes you'd think there'd be a way to manage soemthing\nstudent: Thank you!! it's so different in Spanish\nteacher: sure i remember having problems the other way round\nteacher: Hey Nadia Kim...are you still planning (or did you do) to do a CAE exam?\nstudent: I'm sure... I think it's important that we go out a bit for our mental and physical health\nstudent: Physical health' is not right, how do you say it?\nteacher: Yes I agree - mental health is important - oh sure physical!\nteacher: although often when we mean physical health we just say 'health' of course\nteacher: shows you the bias towards that side of things\nstudent: About the CAE exam, a month ago I decided to postpone it. I was doing too many things and I was very stressed... I couldn't sleep well. So I decided to postpone what wasn't urgent\nteacher: yes I see - sounds like it was a good idea - I guess it's not possible to do the exams at the moment anyway...\nstudent: And suddenly now I have soooo much free time... haha life is showing us that we shouldn't plan so much\nteacher: yes that's true....I guess we've been pampered for decades\nstudent: sure\nteacher: we can't cope without our routines...\nteacher: and the state doing lots of things for us\nstudent: But it'd be great (if you want) to keep looking at CAE exercises\nteacher: not that I'm complaining exactly!\nteacher: Yes of course we can do that if you like...\nstudent: Sure!! thanks\nteacher: I have the book with me - do you want to have a go now? PAge 130 for example?\nstudent: me too :)\nstudent: No idea about 17\nteacher: ah ok - it's an adjective meanign they had influence - does that help?\nstudent: let me think...\nstudent: influential??\nteacher: adjective endings.....-ive/-ous--ial ...choose one of these!\nteacher: Yes you've got it - well done\nstudent: great clues! thank you\nteacher: and you didn't say influencial which is a common Spanish mistake\nstudent: 18 inspiration\nteacher: yes good\nstudent: 19 generosity\nteacher: great\nstudent: 20 restless??\nteacher: yes right idea for the meaning = good BUT you need a noun i.e. the thing that led him...\nteacher: add a noun ending to your adjective\nstudent: ness?\nteacher: yes that's right!\nstudent: REALLY??\nstudent: restlessness??\nstudent: I didn't know that word existed\nteacher: yes really...e.g. hopelessness/restlessness/homelessness etc\nteacher: fearlessness!\nteacher: Remember that with the schwa sound it's quick when people say it - maybe looks more weird that it sounds...\nteacher: or maybe not to you I don;t know!\nstudent: I guessed it because yesterday I listened to an Esther Perel podcast called 'sexlessness'. Do you know her? She is great, I think... she is a therapist\nteacher: no i don't actually - but there you go - good extensive listening\nstudent: Yes, I see how important it is to keep listening and reading things in English\nstudent: Well, I'll continue\nteacher: yes it's the one thing really you can do\nstudent: 21 medical\nteacher: yes good\nstudent: 22 admiration\nteacher: fine\nstudent: 23 enthusiasm\nteacher: yes good\nstudent: no idea about 24 (is this sentence correct? is there a better way of saying that I don't know the answer??)\nteacher: Um you 'no idea about' is fine and common don't worry...apart from that...I haven't got a clue\nteacher: is common\nstudent: ok\nteacher: yes I guessed 24 would be tough - it's ;outcry' - have you seen that before?\nstudent: no, never\nteacher: it's like protest/controversy/opposition\nteacher: as  the noun form of 'cry out' (in pain/anger etc)\nteacher: bit Germanic I guess!\nstudent: I understand, thanks\nteacher: There are lots of verbs/nouns with 'out' that don't come so easilly to mind for you perhaps\nstudent: I'm sure...\nteacher: as in some will be in your passive knowledge but perhaps not used so much\nteacher: in my experience with e.g. Italians/Spanish/French etc\nteacher: for obvious reasons\nstudent: Can you give an example? I can't think of any\nteacher: yes sure ..hold on...\nteacher: so verbs first ...maybe a bit easier cos there are more perhaps\nteacher: so if I run faster than you ...I _______ you (one-word verb answer)\nteacher: ?\nstudent: pass\nstudent: overtake\nstudent: ? not sure\nteacher: Ah well possible I guess - as in the moment itself - but more generally we can say 'outrun'\nteacher: by the way overtake good idea and very common (but still only for the moment itself)\nstudent: Another new word for me!!\nteacher: lots of Spanish speakers just say pass - good to have thought of overtake = very natural\nteacher: but yes 'outrun' = normal too so good to know\nteacher: What about e.g. score more points than?\nstudent: no idea\nteacher: outscore!\nteacher: and: fight harder than?\nstudent: outfight??\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: be more than (in number)\nstudent: but I don't know how to use these words!!\nstudent: For example, can I say 'My team outscored yours'?\nteacher: Well for example....if Mnachester UNIted beat Barcelona 5-0 then the sports report might say that they outfought, outran, outmuscled, outscored, outplayed Barcelona\nteacher: any combination of these verbs!\nteacher: and others too!\nstudent: i see\nteacher: bit more formal than some phrases but still you'll hear these words a fair bit\nstudent: So the example I wrote is not correct, is it?\nteacher: by the way 'outnumber' was the last one - this is really common...as in e.g. males outnumber females in senior managemnt roles (or whatever!)\nteacher: sorry  - which example are you saying wasn't correct?\nstudent: I'll try to correct it... My team outscored yours last night\nstudent: Before your examples, I wrote one\nteacher: Oh sorry I see it now!\nteacher: Yes you just need to say 'outscore' because this already includes the idea of 'points'\nteacher: this is why it's quite efficent you see!\nteacher: German!\nstudent: Now I got it... I think\nstudent: haha yes\nteacher: OK one more ...so Apple has sold more devices than anyone else = Apple has hugely  _______ other tech companies\nstudent: In Germany they can still go out for walks with another person... I think they are much more sensible than Spanish people...\nteacher: yes I guess if you pick a limited number (or just one) of people and then stick with them it would be ok right?\nteacher: I feel bad because my daughter won't be able to play with her friends for months potentially\nteacher: this is the same in Spain right? As in kids can't play with anyone?\nteacher: Sorry I got sucked into the madness of the 'situation'\nstudent: I actually don't know, maybe it's the right way to stop the virus but it's very hard for everyone...\nteacher: yes - it'll be very difficult I'm sure - maybe people will start rebelling after a while I don;t know\nteacher: You know it's weird in the uK because we have no history of the state really being able to tell us what to do do you see?\nstudent: About your daughter and children in general, I know it's really hard but then I think of children who live in Syria for example where they can't leave their houses because there are bombs and I think that we are lucky...\nteacher: so e.g. the realtionship with the police is kind of contractual\nteacher: No of course you're right...it's all relative!\nteacher: I should take my own advice and change my perspective!\nstudent: No, I think it's very normal... we are all confused and we all have contradictory ideas about everything at the moment... It's a very new situation but I think it'll last long enough (unfortunately) to clarify our ideas\nstudent: Sorry, about Apple\nstudent: I don't know the answer!",
    "student: hi\nstudent: I am Emily\nstudent: good afternoon Ms. Johnson\nstudent: Are you here?\nteacher: Hi Emily are you there?\nstudent: yes\nstudent: good afternoon Ms. Johnson\nteacher: Hi there! I'm glad you made it...welcome to the site!\nteacher: How are things with you - all ok?\nstudent: in fact I've just left hospital today\nteacher: Oh no! Why's that?\nstudent: It took me 25 hours to fly from London to Shanghai because I needed to change in Singapore.\nteacher: Oh I see - I didn't realise you'd gone back to China! Are you happy to be back though?\nstudent: When I arrived in Shanghai I got a high temperature\nteacher: I understand - did they test you for the virus then?\nstudent: not really, I wanted to stay in the UK, but my parents made me go back.\nstudent: yes, I had some medical tests done\nteacher: Oh I'm sorry - I guess they were worried about you...so they 'let' you back or 'made' you go back?\nteacher: But you tested negative right?\nstudent: I think it probably is 'made me go back'\nstudent: Today I have left the hospital because the test results show I am healthy. However, I still need to stay at the hotel where the government requires [travellers] to stay for 14 days. After that, I will have the test done again. One of the main requirements which allow me back home is that I still do not have COVID-19.\nteacher: Yes if you didn't have much of  a choice then yes, 'made' is best!\nteacher: OK i understand - well, that's good to know you're clear of the virus I guess...\nstudent: yes, but not a good experience\nstudent: I was really willing to stay in the UK.\nteacher: No I can imagine it was difficult.....Emily, shall we go into some IELTS -based stuff now? IS that what you want to do?\nteacher: Yes I know you were keen on life in the UK - I'm sure you can come back in the not too distant future!\nstudent: yes,  let's start\nteacher: OK fine...hold on a sec...\nstudent: I will be back at the end of June.\nstudent: ok\nteacher: OK so, I thought I'd try to help you with getting started on writing an essay fluently and easily using a technique you can copy again and again\nteacher: LEet me give you an example essay qyestion and then we'll think about an introduction ok? hold on\nstudent: That is great. I really need it.\nteacher: The best way to be healthy is daily exercise. To what extent do you agree?\nteacher: So before you answer hold on...!\nstudent: ok\nteacher: I'm going to suggest that a two-sentence intro that is direct and quite short is a good method\nteacher: and one that you can use for basically any question\nteacher: THe first part/sentence in the intro is what we can call a background sentnece...\nstudent: ok, I will write them in my notebook.\nteacher: so try one now just rephrase the idea in the question for the first bit\nteacher: just the first sentence - keep it short and really similar if you like (better !)\nteacher: So for example...the most.....?\nteacher: the most __________ way to....?\nteacher: any ideas for the missing word?\nstudent: effective\nstudent: the most effective way to...\nteacher: OK great...so we have: The most effective way to....Ah yes good!\nteacher: way to what?!\nstudent: the most effective way to...\nstudent: way to keep healthy\nteacher: ok thanks good idea and undestandable but ...hold on\nteacher: so you could say e.g. : lead a healthy lifestyle\nteacher: The most effective way to lead a healthy lifestyle is [daily exercise]?\nteacher: can you think of a similar word for daily? And exercise?!\nstudent: the most effective way to lead a healthy lifestyle is ...\nstudent: day-to-day\nstudent: and training\nteacher: Ah OK Emily thanks for you ideas.....hold on\nstudent: ok\nteacher: yes both these words are possible - let me give you some examples that are more frequent/look more normal....\nteacher: e.g. frequent/regular physical activity (OK?)\nstudent: yes,  these are better than mine\nteacher: or e.g. to take part in physical activity on a daily basis\nteacher: OK great, so we have the same sentence as in the question but in our won words...we just need to add at the beginning e.g. 'It is often argued that'\nteacher: our own words I meant\nteacher: Happy with this first 'background' sentence?\nstudent: so..are normal words and sentences more important in Academic English?\nteacher: Sorry, I'm not sure I understand your question..try again...\nstudent: we can use different words in writing, but normal words are better than other words which mean the same?\nteacher: Do you mean it's good to use 'normal' words instead of 'academic' words?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: OK right sorry yes I understand ...hold on...\nteacher: I think the important thing is that you achieve the right result using the language you know as accurately as possible\nteacher: in other words the priority is to write an effective intro\nteacher: if you don't do that because ou make lots of mistakes trying to use 'difficult' words then no that's not great\nteacher: better to use more simple words accurately to write an effective essay\nteacher: That might feel difficult to accept Emily I know but trust me ....it's the best approach!\nteacher: If you DO know a more 'difficult' word and you are confident that it is appropriate and accuarate then of course go for it! But if not then be safe\nteacher: that's my advice!\nstudent: ok, thank you very much\nteacher: OK Emily no problem! So...we have our first background sentence..now we need what you can call the 'thesis' statement - do you know this idea?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Your 'thesis' is just a formal word for your big idea or argument right?\nteacher: Don't worry too much about changing your username by the way - I know it's you!\nteacher: The box goes a bit crazy when you try to do it doesn't it? I'm not sure why!\nstudent: yes...maybe it's just my internet problems, I can't stop it from changing,sorry....\nteacher: OK so here your big idea just needs to say whether you agree or not with the main idea....so can you tell me in just normal words if you do agree (don't worry about the essay answer - just in normal speaking if you like!)\nteacher: in other words: is exercise the best way?\nstudent: yes, doing exercise is one of the best thing that people can do in daily life\nteacher: OK fine ... is it THE best way??\nteacher: in your opinion?\nstudent: of course, I suppose it is the best way to support people's health.\nteacher: OK fine ....so if you agree then you can just say that e.g.: I strongly agree that ....?\nstudent: ok, I strongly agree that doing exercise is the best way\nteacher: Or sorry....at the most basic level you could just say: I strongly agree with this idea.\nteacher: Or you coud repeat the main idea again a little bit and say: I strongly agree that exercise plays a ....?\nteacher: Yes your idea was fine...good.\nstudent: I strongly agree that exercise plays a role in a healthy lifestyle.\nteacher: so you need the phrase: 'play a role' or 'play a part' and in this case: .'...plays a major/crucial/significant role.' OK?\nstudent: ok\nstudent: I got it\nteacher: OK thanks Emily so these two sentences together would be fine as an intro ......one last thing ....what about diet? Could that be important too?\nstudent: yes, we need more details to support our opinions\nteacher: OK but hold on ....if you only say that diet is the most importnat thing in your intro then really you would basically talk about that ...so if you want to mention diet in your essay you need to mention it in your intro 0 do you see?\nteacher: sorry I mean if you only say that exercise is the most importnatn thing\nteacher: So for example...in your opinion is diet as important as exercise or less important ?\nstudent: as important as exercise\nteacher: ah ok! So if this is your 'thesis' then you should say that in the intro...hold on...\nteacher: So for example; Although I agree that exercise plays an important role ....' can you finish this?\nstudent: ok, I try to finish it\nteacher: ok...\nstudent: Although I agree that exercise plays an important role in our way of life, healthy eating habits are more important.\nteacher: ok thanks Emily...healthy eating habits = a nice phrase! So if they are equally importnt as you suggested eariler then e.g.: healthy eating habits are just as important or 'equally important' or 'also significant' (or something!) OK?\nstudent: I got it\nteacher: OK so can you write the whole intro (only 2 sentences!) from memory now?!\nteacher: Actually really sorry Emily I didn't notivce te time -we have to stop ...but copy it and paste it later ok? hold on\nstudent: ok\nteacher: so let's have a 15-minute break and I'' see you back here at 17:15 OK? thanks bye for now (log out of the site please!)\nteacher: OK Emily?\nteacher: OK I'm going to log out now but I'll log back on soon - please log out when you can....",
    "teacher: Welcome back Emily Johnson - i'll forget about changing my username!\nteacher: Hi are you there?\nstudent: I am here\nteacher: OK!\nstudent: I strongly agree that exercise plays a significant role. Although I agree that exercise plays an important role in our lifestyle, healthy eating habits are more necessary.\nteacher: OK so...you just need the background one first e.g. It is is often argued that the most effective way to lead a healthy lifestyle is regular exercise. AND then the thesis sentence beginning: 'Although I agree that (and finishing as above)OK?!\nstudent: ok..thanks, should I put this in the main paragraphs?\nteacher: What do you mean: 'does it write'?\nstudent: the background one and the thesis sentence\nstudent: go in the main pragraphs\nteacher: Ah ..you mean: Do we write these sentences in the main paragraphs! OR e.g. Are these sentences written in the main paragraphs...or : Should I write these sentences ...\nteacher: And NO you shouldn't ..not like this anyway...these two sentences are for the introduction\nteacher: and they make a beautiful intro for our original essay question!\nstudent: yes!! that's what I meant\nteacher: OK!\nstudent: I got it,thanks...\nteacher: So Emily Johnson can you follow this model (the two sentences) for the following question...wait a minute and I'll send it (remember keep it short and simple i suggest at the moment -just focus on the model structure ok?\nstudent: ok\nteacher: Here's the question (I'll give you a few minutes): Governments are spending a lot of money on finding life on other planets. Some people say this is a waste of money and that they should more money on the problems of the public. To what extent do you agree?\nteacher: sorry: '...that they should SPEND more money on the problems....\nstudent: ok..let me think\nteacher: so just the intro right...two short sentences ...do your best ...don't worry too much about the language\nstudent: It is often argued that the most effective way for the government to spend money is on the public. Although I agree that this plays an important role, finding life on other planets is more necessary.\nteacher: OK thanks a lot Emily Johnson - I can see you've tried to follow the model really closely, including the exact phrases from the last one....maybe this isn't always possible ...the important thing is the structure...so the background sentence here is really that people say spending money on finding alien life is a waste of money - do you see?\nstudent: I think changing words into normal is difficult work for me\nteacher: And your thesis sentence would be whether you agree or not..OK?\nteacher: OK no problem..let's take it more slowly ...hold on!\nstudent: I disagree with the idea that money should be spend on public\nteacher: OK I understand...so can you think of a synonym for 'spending' beginning with 'ex...'\nteacher: no worries if not...how about 'expenditure'?!\nstudent: expending\nteacher: good idea ...nearly! Expenditure = good!\nstudent: yes, that's great\nteacher: oK! so..how about a synonym for: 'finding life on other planets'?\nteacher: if nothing comes to mind  quickly just let me know ...\nstudent: discover\nteacher: yes good!\nteacher: and life on other planets?\nstudent: a new culture  in space\nstudent: outer space\nteacher: thanks Emily Johnson - an interesting idea! How about an adjective for 'not from Earth' - beginning with the letter 'a' or the letter 'e'? Ah! outer space = nice phrase\nteacher: can you think  of either adjective?\nstudent: I have no idea\nteacher: no problem - so 'alien life' or extraterrestrial life' are both possible\nstudent: extra\nteacher: yes good!\nstudent: ok..thanks\nteacher: OK right so now with our synonyms we can write the following for example: 'Government expenditure on the search for alien life has incraesed in recent years.' OK?\nteacher: I know that's difficult words but you can see this is just a paraphrase of the original question right?\nstudent: yes, it make the sentence more advanced. I like it.\nteacher: OK fine! And if you think this is bad then you could write the following thesis sentnce:  In my opinion, governments should deal with everyday problems  and spend the money on education  and hospitals.\nstudent: I got it ,it is really useful for me.\nteacher: Emily Johnson, if you're not tired of this can we try one more? LEt me send another question - i'll choose a simple one - hold on a sec ok?\nstudent: ok,i want to try\nteacher: ok great! so: In many towns and cities the volume of traffic is a problem. What are the causes of this problem  and what actions can be taken to address it?\nteacher: I'll give you a few minutes ... just let me know if you need any help\nstudent: ok\nstudent: Traffic system problems in the city and urban area have increased in recent years.\nteacher: THanks Emily Johnson - a very good example overall for the first sentence - wel ldone!\nstudent: thanks...\nteacher: Send me the second sentnce if you can and we'll look at them both together in a minute...\nteacher: So remember your thesis here is just what you think the causes/solutions are (very generally in the intro without any details!)\nstudent: One of significant causes of this problem is that population has increased, which means a large number of ...\nstudent: ok,i wrote the wrong one\nteacher: no that's OK ... I guess you can see this is getting a bit long..!\nstudent: but in general, I need to write opinions without any details,  right?\nteacher: if you like Emily Johnson just tell me in a couple of keywords the causes ok?\nteacher: and/or solutions\nstudent: a large number of vehicles.......solutions: limited number of cars on the roads a day\nteacher: so e.g. population (ok fine enough to understand your idea - and what's the solution here?!) and another keyword for a differtn cause?\nteacher: ah sorry yes hold on\nteacher: ok good solution and one more cause?\nstudent: public transport is not convenient\nteacher: ok great!\nteacher: hold on...\nteacher: so first sentence: The amount of traffic in urban areas (great phrase by the way!) has increased in recent years.\nteacher: OR e.g. traffic congestion  = good phrase\nstudent: ok\nstudent: I write them in my notebook\nteacher: OK great...Second sentence: The solution lies in ....?(just give your two solutions here in simple language if you can!)\nteacher: So: 'The solution lies in ...____ing the ....and in _________ public ______'\nstudent: The solution lies in limiting the number of cars on the roads,and improving public transportation.\nteacher: yes great Emily Johnson thanks! Let me show my version (but yours is good too...) hold on\nteacher: The solution lies in limiting the number of cars on the road and in improving public transport/encouraging the use of public transport.\nteacher: OK Emily Johnson so we can come back to writing intros in another lesson but I hope this has helped you feel moreconfident about what you can do...\nstudent: yes, it is very useful for me.\nstudent: thanks very much\nstudent: I will practice it after class.\nteacher: OK no problem - I guess we'll stop there for today - I'll speak to you tomorrow at the same time OK? bye for now\nstudent: yes, bye .Have a good night.\nteacher: ok and you...",
    "teacher: Hi Emily!\nstudent: Hi Mrs. Rodriguez.!\nstudent: How is it going?\nteacher: Any news from your end?\nteacher: well I'm OK...\nstudent: No news... still at home\nteacher: New developments here...we've been asked to stay indoors ...unsurprisngly\nstudent: Good news!!\nteacher: yes I guess so..and everything's shut basically\nstudent: How many cases so far?\nteacher: Um...I think several thousand\nteacher: so it hasn't taken off yet in the same way as in Italy (and Spain:()\nstudent: Can you still go out for a walk?\nteacher: yes but the idea is to limit it and to really stay away from people - they left the parks open and people were' flocking to them'\nteacher: so there were lots of pictures in the news of crowds etc\nteacher: the morons!\nstudent: morons??\nteacher: idiots!\nteacher: lots of synonyms for this obviously but 'moron' fairly common\nstudent: That's the problem, or at least I think that was the problem in Spain... If they don't shut everything down, people keep meeting and celebrating parties, birthdays...\nteacher: not exactly a compliment  but not vulgar by the way\nstudent: ahh, thanks\nteacher: yes I see - you have to really tell people directly i Guess...don't go near anyone\nteacher: anywhere\nteacher: everyone got a text message from the government saying: STAY AT HOME!\nteacher: did that happen in Spain?\nstudent: yes, unfortunately it seems we need that to be sensible\nteacher: yes (good use of 'sensible' by the way - often a word that non-natives miss)\nstudent: Noo, that's great. The message, I mean\nteacher: yes it was a bit weird (but good they can do that)\nteacher: I'm discovering new interests on the internet....\nstudent: About the word 'sensible' I learnt it working at school with little children... teachers used to say 'be sensible' a lot, haha I liked it!\nteacher: Ah yes I see! Great authentic exposure - yes really common as you'll have seen...\nstudent: Which interests have you discovered??\nteacher: yes ...so I didn't really use to spend much time on the web but now....well just different academic subjects you know\nteacher: so I've realised all the great lectures you can access and so on\nstudent: no idea about it... Lectures from University?\nteacher: I'm a bit behind the times..I still get (got) books out of the library\nteacher: yeah you know ...just random stuff downloaded...various university lectures that have been filmed and uploaded\nstudent: hehe that's nice\nteacher: of variable quality but if you're selective...\nstudent: did you find them on youtube?\nteacher: yes mainly\nteacher: I think you can just do the equiavalent of a degree course you know\nteacher: in e.g. anthropology or philosophy or whatever\nstudent: Interesting... I didn't know that if you want you could go and sit at a university there and listen to lectures\nteacher: yes well some of them you can\nteacher: We're lucky in CAmbridge of course\nteacher: you know the 'SCience Festival' was this month but of course it was basically canacelled\nstudent: I was meant to go when I was there but I didn't :( too lazy with the cold\nteacher: yeah I understand...!\nstudent: I went to the Ideas Festival\nteacher: oh right yes so you know the idea - pretty cool right? Better than anything in Spain (I bet?!)\nstudent: Only the last day and I found it very interesting... It's great in Cambridge the amount of interesting free stuff you have (is it correct)\nteacher: Yes we're lucky - it's great if you have kids\nteacher: the day before it was cancelled I went with my daughter to a talk on sending a rover to MArs (by the woman who designed it) it was great, really inspiring\nstudent: Yes, it's great if you have kids, if you don't, if you are old or young... there are a lot of options, many more than here I would say\nteacher: Yes I guess the flip side is that OXbridge is often criticised for being elitist so they do it out of guilt maybe!\nstudent: It sounds very good (the talk you mention)\nstudent: hehe maybe, it doesn't matter the reason!! they do it :)\nteacher: Yeah true!\nstudent: I don't know what Oxbridge is\nteacher: Oh sorry...Oxford and Cambridge combined\nteacher: the top two\nstudent: Ahhh\nteacher: a common word\nteacher: instead of constantly repeating the two names\nteacher: as they're often talked about together\nstudent: So, Oxbridge means Oxford and Cambridge but you used it as a singular (is)\nteacher: (like I just did)\nteacher: yes that's true\nteacher: it is singular weirdly\nstudent: I like it!!\nteacher: Sounds good if you use it\nteacher: Emily...going back to the crowds in the park ....in the media the following day there was an ________?\nteacher: a word from yesterday!\nstudent: outcry??\nteacher: yes exactly! very natural here\nteacher: another similar possible word would be 'outrage' by the way\nstudent: yes, I see how to use it! thanks\nteacher: a bit stronger perhaps\nstudent: I've seen that one\nteacher: more the feeling whereas outcry is more the protest\nteacher: Do you fancy having a go at a CAe exercise?\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: ok ...is page 111 OK? As in you haven't done it before?\nstudent: Ohh we did it together\nteacher: Oh sorry! |Are you sure? I've got no memory of it!\nteacher: You can suggest one if you like...?\nstudent: wait\nteacher: ok\nstudent: page 149\nteacher: ok go for it (are you sure we didn't this one?!)\nteacher: do this one\nteacher: Sorry I should have kept a record (actually I did but I can't find it)\nstudent: not sure... my memory is really bad :(. I know we did the other one because I wrote the answers in pencil in the book and I never do it unless I do it with you\nteacher: OK - how about a part 4? page 150 for example?\nstudent: ok, 150\nteacher: ok I'll give you  a littel bit longer for each one as they're slightly more complicated perhaps\nstudent: Ohh I don't know the meaning of aback\nstudent: I've never seen this word before\nteacher: Ah yes a tricky one to start! so the word only really exists in the structre you need here ..and it's 'to be taken aback'\nteacher: so changed for this answer it would be...?\nstudent: I was taken aback...\nteacher: yes good...by...?\nteacher: something!\nstudent: by the warmth\nteacher: yes great...a relatively common phrase by the way\nstudent: uff very new for me :(\nteacher: you can see the idea right? It's like I took a step back in surpries\nteacher: surprise...but we don't really think of it like that I guess\nteacher: I mean we just say it without making that connection\nstudent: Yes, I get it, thanks\nteacher: I never have!\nstudent: Ohh no, I find it difficult to use 'worth'...\nteacher: OK don't panic!\nteacher: The structure remember is 'to be worth ____ing something'\nteacher: Sorry if you didn't want help!\nstudent: Something like... It is not worth\nteacher: yes good\nstudent: Yes, it helps a lot.\nstudent: It's not worth persuading\nteacher: yes fine but you need the first verb from the original too\nteacher: I mean before persuade\nstudent: ahh I see\nstudent: It's not worth trying to persuade\nteacher: yes great\nteacher: so maybe now you'd say...'Don't bother trying...' or maybe 'there's no point trying.' = both good..\nstudent: that the job involves traveling\nteacher: yes good\nstudent: I've seen the next structure in other exercises but I don't remember it...\nteacher: Sorry Emily not paying attention - maybe better = would involve/involved (travelling) - maybe  they'd be strict on that\nteacher: Ah yes - oh god ....inversion!\nstudent: I understand!! the 'would involve...'\nteacher: ok good\nteacher: So ..with inversion...hold on a sec\nteacher: So with some negative structures you can invert them (change them round) usuallly in more formal use\nteacher: a simple example: I don't only like chocolate I also like cakes (stupid i know sorry)\nteacher: So we invert it and we get...\nstudent: could you give me 2 minutes??\nteacher: Not only do I like chocolate I also like cake\nteacher: yes of course\nstudent: I'm very sorry, I had to go out and clap. We do it every day in Spain since this 'situation' first happened... and I feel very bad if I don't do it\nteacher: Oh wow - at a particular time or..?\nstudent: Yes, it's at 7. We do it for doctors, nurses, and people who take care of the ones who are ill. And my neighbours play a few songs for everyone, sing and dance on the balconies... When the show finishes we all applaud. It's nice... before we didn't even know each other\nteacher: I see - that's good - yes a shame it takes something like this I guess but still...\nstudent: Sure, I hope from now we will become a bit more sociable (not too much haha)\nteacher: Yeah right! well we'll see...\nstudent: Well, back to the inversion\nteacher: Yes!\nteacher: CAn you see my example above - dies it look familiar?\nstudent: No, it doesn't sound familiar but I see how it works...\nteacher: OK so in CAE they'll definitely test you on this...\nteacher: So basically adverb phrases can go at the beginning...\nteacher: So e.g. I have rarely seen  = ?\nstudent: No idea :(\nstudent: I was about to start like 'had not taken...\nteacher: THat's OK! so you just have to put the adverb at the beginning ...so : Rarely have I seen....\nstudent: But the first word is had, isn't it?\nteacher: yes I see - this is a particularly difficult one actually  - you need to say: (had) it not been for (!)\nstudent: So the answer is 'had it not been for'\nteacher: So e.g. in the second conditional a simialr (non inverted ) structure = if it wasn't for you etc...\nteacher: but in the third conditional this can be inverted giving you...yes: Had it not been for...\nstudent: I see... but really difficult\nstudent: for me!\nteacher: yes this one is to be honest .... I'll think of a way to go over this a bit next time perhaps...\nteacher: something to look forward too!\nstudent: Still a lot to practice...\nstudent: Thank you very much!\nteacher: Yes they do include quite a range of stuff in the exam - OK thanks Emily I guess we'll stop there - I'll speak to you tomorrow take care!\nteacher: no problem bye\nstudent: yes, speak to you tomorrow!",
    "student: Good afternoon Ms. Williams\nstudent: I am Sophia Williams\nteacher: hi Sophia Williams sorry give me 5 minutes ok\nstudent: ok\nstudent: hi\nteacher: hi there sorry  a few more minutes really sorry\nstudent: ok, it doesn't matter.\nteacher: Sophia Williams while you're waiting go online and search internet images for  'ielts pie chart france' look at the black and white one not the colour one\nteacher: the site is ielts.org can you find it?\nstudent: ok, I'll attempt to find it now.\nteacher: ok\nstudent: Could you tell me the title of the pie chart?\nstudent: Is it 'English proficiency increases in France'?\nteacher: hold on Sophia Williams - i've realised i can email you the link - OK?\nstudent: ok, that is a great way.\nteacher: yes sorry I was being stupid! have you got it - it's just an image in a word document\nstudent: wait a minute,I will check my email.\nteacher: i've resent it - i may have made a mistake the first time - do you have it now?\nstudent: yes, I have it.\nteacher: ok great\nstudent: no problem.\nteacher: OK let's go - sorry for delay...Sophia Williams: can you tell me in one sentence only about natrual gas in Australia in 1980 please? Do not mentino any other fuel of France OK? just a simple sentence explaining that data point!\nteacher: any other fuel or anything about france i meant ..,ONLY gas in Australia in one year\nteacher: no comparisons!\nstudent: the title is 'Units of electricity by fuel source in Australia', right?\nstudent: ok, just now my internet was slow, now it has recovered\nteacher: that's right - the original top sentnece includes  the phrase 'electricity production' if that helps\nteacher: electricity production by fuel source'\nstudent: The pie chart illustrates the information on how much electricity was produced by fuel source in Australia in 1980.\nstudent: OR the pie chart shows the information about the amount of electricity produced by fuel source in Australia in 1980.\nteacher: OK thanks Sophia Williams - you've written an introduction there and it's not bad - we'l lcome back to that later and i'll give you specific feedback on that sentence BUT for now could you write a sentence telling me what you can about: natural gas/Australia/1980 - what can you tell me about that specific point in the context of the chart?\nteacher: only that point nothing else\nstudent: fossil fuels\nstudent: Australian\nteacher: so for example: In 1980.....?\nteacher: you just need to use the keywords 'gas/20 units' etc ok?\nstudent: how much fossil fuel did Australia produce per unit in 1980?\nteacher: OK Sophia Williams thanks....hold on\nstudent: ok..\nteacher: So Sophia Williams it's true that the chart tells you that Australia produced '100 units of electricity' in 1980. And the chart tells you how it produced that electricity right?\nteacher: In other words it tells you the fuels that it used to produce the electricity....\nstudent: oh, I understand\nteacher: And it tells you the proportion of electricity that that each fuel provided\nteacher: OK good!\nteacher: Do you want to try the sentence again?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: ok...\nstudent: In 1980 Australia produced 100 units of electricity in 4 groups: coal, oil,natural gas and hydro power.\nteacher: OK thanks Sophia Williams.....so this is a general sentence ok fine BUT what about GAS (just gas!) and 20 units - tell me that! Just that!\nteacher: in 1980 in Australia\nteacher: But sorry Sophia Williams  -your idea in that sentence was OK...\nstudent: emmmm...in 1980 in Australia the GAS was 20 percent\nteacher: OK thanks\nteacher: so let's think about the language we can use here to describe proportions - this is a common idea in task 1\nstudent: ok\nteacher: so if i say for example - there are 10 students in the class and 4 of them are female ...we can say that: Females __________ for ________ of the class. (Any ideas?)\nstudent: no..I do not have ideas.\nteacher: That's OK! no problem...just wanted to give you a chance\nteacher: So we can say: females account for 40% of the class. OK? Have you seen this before?\nstudent: wow, yes\nteacher: OK great hold on\nstudent: no\nteacher: ok well...'account for' just means something like 'is reposnsible for' if you see what I mean\nstudent: I have not seen it before\nteacher: you can't say that though!\nteacher: OK another way of saying that would be: Females make up 40% of the class.\nteacher: IS this one new for you too?\nstudent: I think so\nteacher: OK - well you've got to start somewhere! I think these two structures will help you get a better score\nstudent: Both of them are new to me and wonderful.\nstudent: thanks\nteacher: ok...so in the context of the pie charts we're looking at now we can say: Natural gas ______ for _____ of electricity in Australia in 1980'?\nstudent: Natural gas accounted for 20% of electricity in Australia in 1980.\nteacher: yes that's great! What verb tense do you need?\nstudent: Natural gas made up 20% of electricity in Australia in 1980.\nteacher: Yes perfect! Good past simple too\nteacher: Account for in the past = accounted for\nstudent: so...Natural gas accounted for 20 % of electricity in Australia in 1980.\nstudent: ok..thanks\nstudent: I got it\nteacher: Yes that's great - that would look good in an answer\nteacher: ok fine\nteacher: So....that's one way to explain that data point....hold on\nstudent: it makes it easy for me to describe the data.\nteacher: Yes that's right.....Another way for this chart could be: 20% of electricity _________  produced _____ natural gas. (Any ideas?\nstudent: ok\nstudent: 20% of electricity was produced from natural gas.\nteacher: Ummmm...not sure I follow you idea there Sophia Williams....So we can say: Natural gas produced 20% of electricity in Australia in 1980 right?  So as a passive we can change it round and say: 20% of electricity was.....?\nstudent: 20% of electricity was produced in Australia in 1980.\nteacher: yes thanks - (20% of electricity was produced from/by natural gas = both correct\nteacher: Is that ok?\nstudent: yes, that is ok\nteacher: Have you studied the passive before very much?\nstudent: not very much..\nteacher: OK well..it's not always essential but it can give you another option - an easy way (hopefully) of using different structures for variety\nteacher: Can i give you a synonym for produce (in the context of energy)? The verb is 'generate' - is that new for you?\nstudent: ok..thanks\nstudent: I will practice it after class.\nteacher: OK great thanks Sophia Williams - so let's have a break OK? See you back here in 15 minutes ok? Remember to log out!\nteacher: Sorry we're runnign a bit late\nstudent: yes, see you\nteacher: ok bye for now",
    "teacher: OK Alexandra can we both try and leave the site and then log back in to start a new session?\nteacher: Um ....OK well ...let's just carry on I guess!\nstudent: ok\nteacher: OK great...hold on\nteacher: How about we leave the pie charts for now and go back to them tomorrow?\nstudent: yes, I think it's great\nstudent: I have one day to memorise them.\nteacher: OK fine - so I was thinking I'd give you some Speaking Part 3 questions and ask you to say a few things about each one as you would int he speaking OK?\nstudent: ok\nstudent: part 3 is the most difficult one I suppose.\nteacher: OK so ...the topic here is 'MEdia and News'....the first question is: 'Do you believe everything you read in the newspapers.'\nstudent: No, I do not believe that, because sometimes they write fake news.\nteacher: OK ...thanks ...maybe one more sentence to develop that?\nstudent: and different newspapers have different positions\nteacher: OK thanks Alexandra - finished?\nstudent: for starters, if one of newspapers just wants to attract readers, they overstate things or write fake information which can build a large reader group as quickly as possible.\nteacher: OK thanks a lot  -we'l l come back to your answers in a while...for now,  Next question: How do you most people get their news in your country?\nteacher: Don't use devices for any help with words by the way Alexandra OK?! (I;m not saying you've done that!)\nstudent: most older people like to get news from newspapers, but young people are willing to get news on social medial.\nstudent: ok\nteacher: I just need to know what's in your head now!\nteacher: OK thanks for that...next question: Shoud children be allowed to watch a lot of TV?\nteacher: Sorry: 'should'\nstudent: sometimes spelling is difficult for me\nteacher: That's ok don't worry - me too when i try to type fast!\nstudent: and the structure of sentences\nstudent: ok, I will do my best every time by myself.\nteacher: yes that's fine just do your best!\nstudent: ok~\nstudent: Yes, childen should be allowed to watch a lot of TV, but it depends on a channel.\nteacher: ok ... a bit more....\nteacher: if you can?\nstudent: For example, some educational channels are good for children. They could learn different things about our world, such as cultures, traditions and so on\nteacher: ok thanks Alexandra...anything on the other side of the argument?\nstudent: However, some movies have a bad influence on children's thinking. For example, they affect children's behaviour, like they do not respect their teachers.\nteacher: Ok great - good stuff - one final questions: Do you think famous people have a responsibility to act as role models for the younger generation?\nteacher: If you're not sure about the meaning of role models you can check it!\nstudent: Yes, I suppose people who are well-known should set a positive example for younger people, because they are household names for children and children like to copy their behaviours.\nteacher: OK thanks a lot Alexandra -  so let's have a think about your answers ...hold on...\nstudent: ok..I always make a lot of grammar mistakes...\nteacher: OK Alexandra some good language you used (well done!): fake news/attract readers/build/willing/get news/on social media/channels/set/culture/and so on/copy their behaviour \u2026.(keep using this stuff!)\nstudent: thanks!!!\nteacher: some things to think about changing a bit...hold on\nstudent: ok\nteacher: readership = a good word for the all the people who read a newspaper/it depends on (don\u2019t forget the \u2018s\u2019) / traditions (the noun)/well known(don\u2019t forget the \u2018n\u2019) \u2026hold on\nteacher: a few more coming\nteacher: household name (not \u2018house\u2019) /set a good example (not set a \u2018model\u2019)/study subjects = better than \u2018learn\u2019 subjects (you learn the thing itself e.g. learn maths\nstudent: ok~\nstudent: thank you very much\nteacher: sorry one more!...'overstate' : is that a verb or a noun?\nstudent: I think it is an adjective\nstudent: an adjective\nteacher: well it's a verb! if you overstate something you exaggerate it....in your example earlier exaggerate or exaggeration would be good\nteacher: So e.g. newspapers exaggerate\nstudent: ok, I am remembering those words\nstudent: thanks\nteacher: OK Alexandra ...here's your first sentence coming up..I just want to focus on two grammatical points: 1. = 'one of' and 2. 'as quick as - Are you happy with those two parts? ! 'if one of newspaper just want to attract readers, they also write overstates or fake information which can build a large reader group as quick as possible.\nteacher: CAn you make a little change to those two bits to correct them?\nstudent: let me think\nteacher: ok...\nstudent: Many newspapers which want to attract readers report news in an exaggerated way\nstudent: in order to build a large readership as quickly as possible.\nstudent: Is it correct now?\nteacher: OK thanks Alexandra - I was thinking just of those two little specific bits ..so for example you should just use these structures: e.g. many or some  - so for example: 'Some newspapers' or 'many newspapers' OK? Forget about 'of' - only if it's follwoed by 'the' BUt hat would be a special specific newspaper and here you don't have one do you see?\nteacher: So you need to say: Some newspapers want to attract readers print fake news\nteacher: sorry '....and print fake news\nstudent: yes, it became more native, I need to practice it.\nstudent: or more academic\nteacher: next one: what about'as quick as' - you just need to change one of the words slightly\nteacher: can you do it? Just one of those three words\nstudent: quick-quickly\nstudent: 'quick'  needs to be changed to 'quickly'.\nteacher: yes good  -well done\nstudent: thanks\nteacher: OK thanks Alexandra - so you're on the right track and you know some good words ...you just need to get things a bit more correct overall (and keep learning new words that's true but being correct with what you have is important so you can explain your ideas clearly!)\nstudent: yes, that is what's really important for me to study\nteacher: I guess we'll stop there - thanks a lot and I look forward to speaking to you tomorrow! bye\nstudent: thanks a lot.\nstudent: ok, bye",
    "teacher: Hi Emily!\nstudent: Hi Mr. Patel\nteacher: HEy there - sorrry give me a minute - go to relight my fire...\nstudent: sure\nteacher: OK  the kindling has caught this time...\nteacher: I sit warm where you are at the moment?\nteacher: is it warm i mean!\nstudent: Sorry, I don't understand... kindling??\nteacher: Ah yes sorry - it's the name for the little bits of wood or whatever you use to start the fire at the beginning\nstudent: Here  it's 18 degrees now, during the day it's very sunny\nteacher: NIce....yes it's actually really sunny this week here too - and maybe....13 degrees!\nstudent: Not too bad 13!!\nteacher: yes! Actually my boat gets warm in the sun so it doesn't really matter about the outside temperatrue...\nteacher: Have you heard of the Amazon 'Kindle' the thing for reading ebooks\nstudent: That's good! I always imagined that boats were cold, so I was wrong\nstudent: Yes, I know what a Kindle is! I prefer books but I see how convenient a Kindle can be...\nteacher: Well they can be in a way - they're kind of a cross between a car and a house you know? As in they don't retain heat very well but hey warm up quickly\nstudent: I see\nteacher: Yes I just mentioned it because it struck me that it's related to the idea of kindling you see? BEcause you kindle a flame - in this cae the flame of knowledge... you kindle a feeling\nteacher: in this case\nstudent: ahh interesting...\nteacher: it's related to 'candle' by the way as you can imagine\nteacher: So Emily...inversion....\nstudent: now I know but before you explained I didn't! thanks\nstudent: yes, inversion!!\nteacher: OK....so we use it for with a limited number of phrases/words - basically negative adverbs - to make something limited or emphatic....\nteacher: for example....the word never (a limiting word let's say...) hold on\nteacher: I have never seen such a terrible sight = Never have i seen such a ...you see?\nstudent: I have a question about something you wrote yesterday. In the sentence 'Not only do I like chocolate I also like cake', do we need to write 'do'??\nteacher: yes we do! Hold on....\nstudent: I understand the example with never\nteacher: OK that's good/...\nteacher: With the present simple v, and past simple verbs we need  auxiliary verb do/did\nteacher: and also make the main verb the infinitive ...\nteacher: for example....hold on\nteacher: Not only does he love chocolate...\nteacher: i.e. he + love NOT loves\nstudent: ok\nstudent: I didn't know we needed an auxiliary verb in affirmative sentences\nteacher: One last example: He only realised later that ... = only later did her realise that...\nteacher: Yes not normally - but inversion is a special case\nstudent: I see\nteacher: although Emily you know of course that we sometimes say e.g. I do like chocolate right?\nstudent: Yes, I know that... but it is different, isn't it??\nteacher: in fact I Could have written: you know that we do sometimes say I do like...\nstudent: In I do like chocolate I can remove 'do' but in inversion we can't (if I understood well)\nteacher: Yes that's true of course..\nstudent: ok\nteacher: I guess it's a bit similar in the sense that it's related to emphasis\nstudent: I see\nteacher: Sorry I can't resist: I Could have written e.g. You do know that we do sometimes say I do like chocolate?\nstudent: do do do do do do haha\nteacher: 3 extra do's in one sentence\nstudent: From now on I'll use 'do' all the time\nteacher: yes - and actually not really exaggerated - we might really say that and it wouldn't sound strange\nteacher: Go for it! Seriously, it's much more common than we think...\nstudent: same with did??\nteacher: It's not always accompanied by a big dramatic tone/gesture/statment\nstudent: I mean, is it also common??\nteacher: yes the same in the past\nteacher: and common\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: For example we often just use it to draw attention to something\nteacher: not in a big dramatic way\nteacher: for example...I did want to go out later (actually)\nstudent: I see\nteacher: just a gentle way of suggesting that even though maybe it's late/we're busy or whatever (not always stated) i still wan tto go out\nteacher: Some of the phrases we invert by the way are pretty formal but not all\nteacher: Formal ones = for example: scarcely/seldom/little\nteacher: more normal: not only/only then\nstudent: Are these the adverbs that go at the beginning??\nteacher: yes exactly..so e.g. Seldom have I been so impressed by blah blah\nteacher: e.g. Little did he think that he would meet him again\nteacher: I think Emily if you listen to more formal speaking (or read stuff like that) you'll notice it more know\nstudent: I'll pay more attention from now...\nteacher: notice it more now' I mean  - now that your attention has been drawn to it\nstudent: yes, I knew what you meant\nteacher: Yeah - it's interesting - because it's one of those 'grammar' things that doesn;t really change the meaning so you can basically not notice it and it doesn't really matter\nteacher: i.e. that's why people don't notice it\nstudent: I'm surprised but I don't remember studying that at all... maybe I did and I've forgotten about it\nteacher: Maybe you were away that lesson! It is something that's often covered quite quickly and in a self-contained kind of way\nstudent: Maybe...\nstudent: Just to clarify...\nteacher: Ah - did you see my auxiliary there? I did that one without thinking (e.g. It IS something that's covered...)\nteacher: yes go ahead\nteacher: you'd hear the difference in speaking (i.e. emphatic) easily\nstudent: If the inverted sentence (do you call them like this) is in past simple we use DID and if it is in present simple we use DO\nteacher: Yes and yes ('inverted' =correct and do/did for present/past respectively)\nstudent: And...\nteacher: yep...\nstudent: if it's in present simple you don't use auxiliary but you invert the order (have he...)\nstudent: but for present or past simple you don't invert the order (did he think...)\nstudent: sorry, I meant present perfect simple when I wrote the example (have he...)\nteacher: Ah right i see hold on...\nstudent: Am I right?? I deduced that from your examples but no idea...\nteacher: well, in the present perfect the auxiliary is 'have' right? so, e.g. Not only has he stolen from me, he has also lied blah blah SAME idea in the present = Not only does he steal from me he...OK?\nteacher: Nice verb 'deduced' by the way!\nstudent: I see!! have is the auxiliary...\nteacher: yes  that's it\nstudent: deduce: deducir en espa\u00f1ol ;)\nteacher: yeah i Guess that's an easy one then! IS it formal in Spanish?\nstudent: It's not really formal, we use it a lot...\nteacher: Oh right - it's a bit formal in English\nteacher: educated' or whatever\nstudent: and do you have an informal word for that?\nteacher: some people might never say it I guess...\nstudent: maybe 'guess'?\nteacher: um ..well i guess like lots of these things it would be replaced by a phrasal verb often - so e.g. work out\nteacher: or guess of vourse yes\nteacher: but 'work out' is maybe best here\nteacher: i just mean more common\nstudent: ok, thanks\nstudent: Could we practise the inverted sentences a bit?\nteacher: because it's like a little process you know? 'Guess' i soften just a quick little or one-step  thing\nteacher: yes sure - i'll give you a prompt OK? UNless you have an idea of your own first?\nstudent: Sure, I see the difference between guess and work out. I sometimes struggle to use phrasal verbs because I don't know where to write the thing I worked out...\nstudent: Maybe we could talk about that another day, sorry (mixing topics)\nteacher: yes! well most are 'separable' so e.g. work out something OR work something out = both correct\nstudent: About a prompt, yes please\nstudent: Ahhh, I thought there was a rule about it!!\nteacher: ok so e.g.: I haven't had so much fun since I was in Spain.\nteacher: Can you invert that?\nstudent: Little fun have I had since I was in Spain??\nteacher: Yes I see your idea...Start with 'Not since...'\nstudent: It's difficult!!!\nteacher: so it's the 3-word negative bit you've got to ivert\nteacher: invert imean\nteacher: e.g. i haven;t had\nteacher: Not since I was...\nstudent: Not since I was in Spain have I had so much fun\nstudent: Not sure!\nteacher: yes good! You've already got the negative with 'not' at the beginning though so: 'haven't I had'?\nstudent: Not since I was in Spain have I had so much fun??\nteacher: yes exactly ...you made your first little baby inversion....\nstudent: ufff very hard... I get very stressed when I see hard new things... OMG there are so many things to learn about a language...\nstudent: Thank you very much for your time and your patience!\nteacher: yes it's infinite that's true! keep calm and carry on - you know loads! OK thanks Emily I guess that's it for today - see you tomorrow bye\nteacher: no problem cheers\nstudent: Yes, see you tomorrow! Bye",
    "student: Good afternoon Mrs. Rodriguez..\nteacher: Hi there Emily Smith, everything OK with you?\nstudent: yes, I am healthy\nteacher: OK great, I;m pleased you're healthY!\nstudent: just staying at a hotel by myself for 14 days, and nurses are taking care of everyone.\nteacher: Oh right - so you're in quarantine for 2 weeks?!\nteacher: But have you tested negative?\nstudent: absolutely, I am for 2 weeks.\nstudent: yes, the test was negative\nteacher: OK right but you still have to stay isolated???\nteacher: Is that logical?\nstudent: I think so...\nteacher: OK well anyway - I hope you cam make the best of it and don't get too down....!\nstudent: Thanks !!  I think you need to take care of yourself too...!\nteacher: Yeah don't worry I'll be fine!\nstudent: ok~~~that's great\nteacher: OK Emily Smith, shall l we do some IELTS magic?!\nstudent: of course, let's do it\nteacher: ok great - so if you can face it, let's go back to the pie charts ok? Can you give me a sentence about coal in France in 1980 please? JUST that nothing else ok?\nstudent: ok\nstudent: Coal accounted for 25% of electricity in France in 1980\nstudent: Coal made up 25% of electricity in France in 1980.\nteacher: Yes thanks Emily Smith that's great language well done ....be careful with the proportion though! Check the units ok?\nteacher: Is it really 25%?\nstudent: wow, it is not 100 units...\nstudent: sorry, my internet was slow just now\nteacher: no that's ok....so no, it's not 100 units...\nteacher: How can you say it then?\nstudent: so...approximately 27% of electricity was produced from coal.\nteacher: OK thanks... wow, you could try and work it out like that if you like....maybe an easier way would be to say e.g. 25 out of 90 units OR more than a quarter ...OK?\nstudent: ok\nteacher: So in fact Emily Smith fractions (half/third/quarter etc) are good to use for variety in language OK?\nteacher: So for example ...52% = just _____ half?\nstudent: just more than half\nstudent: just exceeding half\nteacher: can you try it with just one word in the gap?\nteacher: beginning with 'o'!\nstudent: just over half\nteacher: YEs thanks! I think that's best..\nteacher: It is best!\nstudent: ok, thanks\nteacher: and what about e.g. 23%?\nstudent: just over third.\nstudent: just over fifth\nteacher: Yes!\nteacher: Or just ________ a quarter?\nstudent: just less than a quarter\nteacher: so if you say 'less' you need to say 'less than' ....so just use one word ok? beginning with 'u'!\nstudent: just u.... a quarter\nteacher: opposite of 'over'\nstudent: I am not sure of the word.\nteacher: under!\nteacher: just under a quarter\nstudent: haha...thanks\nteacher: ok!\nstudent: just under a quarter\nteacher: Yes that's it good...So by the way you need 'a' before all fractions except for 'half' (although it's possible to out it in for 'half' too)\nteacher: so e.g. a third/a quarter\nstudent: ok, I got it\nteacher: when it's just one I mean...actually 'one' is correct too right? so a/one third etc\nteacher: BUT e.g. two fifths/three quarters etc ...obviously without 'a'\nteacher: So Emily Smith...last individual one...What about coal in Australia in 2000?! Tell me about that in one sentence (try a fraction if you like too)\nstudent: ok, it is a very different way to explain data\nteacher: Do you mean fractions?\nstudent: coal was 130 out of 170 units in Australia in 2000\nteacher: OK fine...hol don\nteacher: hold on I mean!\nstudent: ok\nteacher: So yes fine - good to get that little structure 'out of' correct ! OR ... e.g. Coal accounted for 130 out of 170 units of electricity OR e.g. Coal generated 130 out of 170 units\nstudent: ok, I understand, thanks\nteacher: And the passive structure? Remember that possibility? So e.g. 130 out of 170 units of electricity...(Can you finish this one?)\nstudent: 130 out of 170 units of electricity are generated from coal.\nteacher: yes ok but you need a verb somewhere!\nstudent: 130 out of 170 units of electricity were produced from/by coal\nteacher: yes ok good thanks! Because it's units it is plural so we need 'were produced from' (good to use verb 'produced' by the way)\nstudent: ok, I got it, thanks\nteacher: OK Emily Smith so let's take another step here OK? So we have given the  basic numbers for coal in 2000 (130 out of 170 units) ...but what does really mean? It's good if we can say that in words you know?\nteacher: What i mean is ...in bad English we might say: 'Yes coal really big 2000' do you see? But in good IELTS English we could say...?\nteacher: Not the numbers just this idea in words\nstudent: Coal was by far the most popular fuel, with 130 out of 170 units were produced.\nteacher: THanks Emily Smith - a very good sentence overall...hold on\nstudent: ok\nteacher: So if we make 2 basic correct sentences we could get: Coal was by far the most significant (better than 'popular' here because people aren't actually choosing it like Coca cola you see?) fuel. It produced 130 out of 170 units. OK?\nstudent: ok, it is better than my sentence.\nteacher: Well yes I guess so! BUT we can take one more step if we like....Look at the one coming up...can you see I have deleted the full stop and the verb - you just need to change the form of the verb ..can you try it?Coal was by far the most significant fuel, _________  130 out of 170 units\nteacher: So e.g. 'produce/produced/producing'? you decide!\nstudent: ok, fewer verbs make sentences more academic.\nstudent: produced\nstudent: because it was in 2000.\nteacher: OK right so I know what you mean BUT remember 'prodcued was in the original two sentence version but here we are changing it so we need: ...Coal was by far the most significant fuel, producing130 out of 170 units\nteacher: Have you seen that before?\nstudent: no.. I could only write very simple sentences before.\nteacher: OK well don't worry too much - the first two-sentence version was still good and you could still get a high score with that OK?\nstudent: ok\nstudent: thanks\nstudent: thanks\nteacher: OK Emily Smith before we finish this hour let me ask you one final question....can you tell me about nuclear power in France in 1980 AND 2000. So you could try it like this: 'In 1980, nuclear power.....However, in 2000....' OK?!\nstudent: ok..\nstudent: In 1980, nuclear power accounted for 15 out of 90 units of electricity. However, in 2000, it was by far the most significant fuel, producing 126 out of 180 units.\nstudent: I think my typing speed has become higher than a few days ago.\nstudent: have becoming\nteacher: Ooohh Emily Smith! That's a great sentence! I'm very happy with that!   Perfect...A great ending...I'll see you in 15 minutes OK?\nstudent: ok, see you later\nteacher: ok\nstudent: thanks",
    "teacher: Hi Alice Smith welcome back\nstudent: hi, here is Alice Smith\nteacher: OK so shall we leave the charts as we did yesterday and try some 'speaking' questions again?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: OK great so...I;m going to go with the topic of 'Society' for today so....First question: 'What social problems are there in your country?'\nstudent: I suppose the biggest social problem in my country is that most young people want to become famous, not to become teachers, which would benefit our society\nteacher: sorry Alice Smith 1 minute!\nteacher: thanks a bit more?\nstudent: for example, when teenagers talk about dream jobs in my country,  most of them are willing to select a singer, a movie actor or star. But those jobs are not always good for our society.\nstudent: ask\nteacher: What can done to alleviate poverty?\nteacher: can be done I mean\nteacher: (alleviate means make less serious)\nteacher: you ok Alice Smith?!\nstudent: I think education can alleviate income differences because if we have more people who have higher education, our low salary jobs could be replaced. For example, cleaners on our streets can be replaced with robots, and some jobs which cannot be replaced will be well-paid.\nstudent: yes\nteacher: OK thanks Alice Smith - a lot of language for me to think about for you = great! We'll come back to it soon...OK one more: Why do so many people move to live in cities?\nstudent: I think there is a multitude of benefits for people moving to a city. For a start, it is a great way for people to have a comfortable life, for example they can use public transport. Another benefit of living in a city is that it allows people to see various kinds of lifestyles, for example, different entertainments.\nteacher: OK thanks a lot Alice Smith..one final  question: 'Do you think all criminals should go to prison?'\nstudent: Yes, without a doubt, people who break the law should be punished. Sending them to prison is one of the best ways to do so. It is really fair to everyone, no matter who it is, if you break the law, you need to get a punishment. Even if you carry out some criminal act\nteacher: OK thanks Alice Smith ..let me show these chunks (pieces) of language from you first answer...are they OK or not OK do you think? (Just say yes or no for all of them as a group!) : I suppose the biggest social problem in my country is that /  want to become famous / for example / those jobs are not always good for our society. So a one-word answer\u2026OK? yes or no?\nstudent: ok\nteacher: Quick decide Alice Smith ..yes or no?!\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Yes! THanks I agree - they are all good chunks of language well done\nstudent: thanks\nteacher: What about these chunks? most of young people / which are benefit on our society / most of them willing to\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Sorry ...not exactly!\nstudent: or have some grammar mistakes\nteacher: Yes that's right...What about the first chunk? What do you need to change?\nteacher: most of young people?\nstudent: most young people\nteacher: Yes great wel ldone - like we said yesterday right?\nteacher: OK and the next chunk ....you need to change the noun 'benfit' to an adjective ..do you know it?\nteacher: I mean the adjective form of benefit\nteacher: benef...?\nstudent: beneficial\nteacher: Yes good so....can you change your chunk a bit?\nteacher: change the preposition 'on' too!\nstudent: I do not have any ideas\nteacher: that's ok...which are beneficial to our society = good\nstudent: ok, I'll write it down in my notebook.\nteacher: what about the last chunk: 'most of them willing'? Can i say for example: I willing to help you? is that correct or do you need to add something ?\nteacher: one word!\nstudent: I am willing to help you\nteacher: is 'willing' a verb/noun or adejctive?\nstudent: I think is is a verb\nteacher: YEs sorry that's right good so your original chunk should be...?\nstudent: most of them are willing\nteacher: well 'willing' is an adjective so you need the verb 'be' ...ah yes that's right good\nstudent: ok...thanks\nteacher: OK no problem so ...your next answer...look at these chunks...good or bad? I think education / income differences / could be replaced / for example / cleaner on our street / robots\nteacher: As a group i mean\nstudent: I feel those are not good\nteacher: Well ...actually they are fine!!\nteacher: income differences = great phrase ....could be replace = good passive  good use of 'for example' as it encourages you to develop your point etc\nstudent: really? those word have just come up in my mind, I am not sure whether they are correct or not.\nteacher: ah ok well keep using those!\nstudent: ok,thanks\nteacher: what about these (from the same answer)? : education can decline income differences / some jobs which can not replace are also...\nstudent: good\nstudent: good?\nstudent: I guess\nstudent: but I am not sure\nteacher: OK well ...something declines by itself do you see? But if something does it it's different so ...i.e. you can't say : the goverment has declined taxes...\nteacher: what verb could you use here instead?\nstudent: drop\nstudent: decrease\nteacher: Again, this is a verb which (in this context) happens by itself e.g. Sales have dropped....=good ..try again!\nstudent: go down\nteacher: Ah same problem with 'decrease'!!\nteacher: AND go down\nteacher: OK OK I'll save you!\nstudent: ok\nteacher: Just to confirm Alice Smith...So I can't say for example: I drop/decline/decrease my Alcohol consumption OK? But I could say I have reduced my consumption (it's a 'transitive' verb)\nteacher: like the difference between rise and raise remember?\nstudent: yes, I forgot reduce\nstudent: yes, i remember rise and raise\nteacher: OK and finally what about that second chunk? : 'some jobs which can not replace are also'...\nteacher: OK good these are common in TAsk 1 so good to remember (you basically normally need rise!)\nteacher: and not raise (for graphs etc)\nstudent: some jobs which are can not replace also ....\nstudent: ok, I got it\nteacher: ok\nteacher: Oh sorry ..you're waiting for me ..hol don\nteacher: I was waiting for you!\nteacher: So...you need the passive here!\nteacher: You got it right before\nteacher: e.g. Money can't replace love...OR Love.....?\nstudent: so....\nstudent: some job which are can not instead of\nstudent: without 'are\nstudent: without 'are'?\nteacher: OK Alice Smith let me help you out here...\nstudent: ok\nteacher: So 'Love can't be replaced by money' = passive and you needed (like you said before in fact without thinking about it) some jobs which cannot be replaced by..you need the 'be' to make it passive\nstudent: thanks\nteacher: a small but important difference..it;s hard to understand otherwise you see - it;s confusing\nstudent: some jobs which are couldn't be replaced\nteacher: Listen - I think we should practise the passive - we'll start more simply with it - it would be good if you could use it correctly!\nstudent: ok, I will do more passive practice after class.\nteacher: I've copied and pasted your answers so we can continue tomorrow - I'll speak to you then OK? Yes do some more practise and I;ll ask you some (easy!) questions tomorrow ....bye!\nstudent: thanks, I think so, it is necessary\nteacher: ok see you\nstudent: bye\nstudent: is it the same time?",
    "student: Good afternoon Emily.\nteacher: Hi Emily how are you? Holding up OK?\nstudent: yes, I am fine, and you?\nteacher: Good - yes all fine here thanks - still getting used to spending so much inside\nteacher: OK so...can we have a think about the passive first today?\nstudent: Great, studying with you is really enjoyable.\nstudent: yes, thanks\nteacher: OK! So...tell me Emily ..is this sentence normal do you think? : 'People make whisky in Scotland.'\nteacher: It's correct BUT is it normal?\nstudent: I think it is not normal.\nteacher: No, it;s not! Why not? Because we don't care about...?\nstudent: whisky is made in Scotland.\nstudent: people\nstudent: we do not care about people.\nteacher: yes exactly - we don't know or care WHO makes it right?\nteacher: What do we care about?\nstudent: we care about whisky.\nteacher: OK great ...so care about the thing/product ..whatever we want to call it ...we don't know/care about the 'agent'\nstudent: and Scotland\nteacher: yes sure\nteacher: So ...we normally say: 'Whisky....'?\nteacher: So START with 'whisky'\nstudent: Whisky is made in Scotland.\nteacher: ok good - only in the past or in general ?\nstudent: In general we can say that whisky is made in Scotland.\nteacher: OK - thanks. Singular or plural? I mean is 'whisky' countable?\nstudent: I am not sure...maybe uncountable.\nteacher: Yes that's right..so we have to say: 'Whisky ___ made in Scotland'?\nstudent: Whisky is made in Scotland.\nteacher: OK great!\nstudent: thanks\nteacher: So the full sentence would be: 'Whisky is made in Scotland by people.' BUT we don't say 'by people' because we don't vcare\nstudent: ok, so in writing, don't we need to say by people too?\nteacher: No it's definitely not necessary and most of the time we do NOT write it! OK Emily ...try the following sentence using the keywords given: Many types cheese/France\nstudent: Many international documents are typed in Chinese/France.\nteacher: Um..OK thanks Emily the chunk 'are typed' is good....what about 'cheese'?!\nteacher: Many types of cheese' look back at the keywords carefully!\nstudent: Many types of cheese are made in France.\nteacher: OK thanks great. Many types of cheese are made/produced/sold (or whatever) in France.\nstudent: ok, thanks.\nteacher: ok hold on....\nstudent: ok\nteacher: OK Emily so ..example essay question: 'IT is often said that the government spends too much on projects to protect wildlife and that other problems are mroe important. Do you agree? '\nstudent: yes, I agree with it.\nteacher: We'l lcome back to the passive in a minute but first: can you just give me one quick idea abou t this question\nteacher: OK fine so tell me why!\nstudent: Because spending a large amount of money on wildlife protection might not solve the problem. Overall, in the whole history of earth, many animals have disappeared. Instead, governments should pay more attention to daily life. For example, spending money on building schools and hospitals is really useful.\nteacher: OK thanks a lot Emily - give me a second...\nteacher: The government should spend more money on public services, such as schools and hospitals. ' - this is your idea right? (one of them)\nstudent: yes\nteacher: OK fine..so do we need to say ' the government'? Do we need to include the 'agent' here - the person/thing that does the action? Is it essential?\nstudent: yes\nstudent: so we do not need to repeat the government, right?\nstudent: just use 'they'?\nstudent: use\nteacher: Oh I see what you mean...no if you want to include the agent then it's good to repeat the full noun especially at the beginning of a sentence/paragraph OK? BUT my question was a bit different ...hold on...\nstudent: ok\nteacher: Sorry when i say the 'full noun' I mean 'the government' and not the pronoun (they)\nteacher: so yes saying the government is better\nteacher: BUT BUT BUT (yes I really wanted to write that word 3 times)...is it necessary to mention the government? We already know that the government is the agent....the person/thing/organisation doing the action (spending the money) right?\nteacher: So do we need to mention the government?\nstudent: I do not think we need to mention the government.\nstudent: but I do not know the reason.\nteacher: OK Emily thanks you're right, we don't have to....and it;s the same we don't need to mention 'people' when we talk about whisky in Scotland! Because we care more about what? The government or the money?!\nstudent: wow! I got it, the more important thing is money not the government.\nstudent: so...money should be spent on public service, such as schools and hospitals.\nteacher: Yes exactly...also because we KNOW that people make whisky (it's not made by cats or dogs!) and we basically know that it the money is spent by the government (not for example by cats or dogs or John or Richard etc!) .....)\nstudent: yes, I can understand it now.\nstudent: thanks\nteacher: THat's why we 'don't care' about the agent Emily you see...because we already know!\nteacher: OK great I think you understand the idea BUT you have have to say/write it correctly .....so hold on....\nstudent: ok\nteacher: The main verb is 'spend' right?\nstudent: yes\nstudent: money should be spent on public services, such as schools and hospitals.\nteacher: Hi Emily sorry ..I lost my internet for a while there - can you read this?\nstudent: yes, i can read it now.\nteacher: OK great!\nteacher: hold on..\nstudent: sometimes I lose my internet\nteacher: Sure...So Emily...if we want to use the verb 'spend' in the 'active' we say e.g. I spend lots of money   or e.g. you spent a lot yesterday...or e.g. the government should spend more...all of these are basically the same because we have the agent first right?\nteacher: me/you/the government (they are the ones spending the money)\nstudent: yes, that's right.\nteacher: OK fine..so if you say 'should spend' then you need an agent first ..the person/thing spending the money ...\nteacher: BUT the passive is different...the structure is 'be spent' - you know this right?\nteacher: YOu have to add the verb 'be'\nstudent: yes, I know it\nstudent: Money is spent on public services, such as schools and hospitals.\nteacher: OK fine ...so in your answer earlier you said: 'money spending should on public service, such as schools and hospitals' ...where is the verb 'be'?!\nteacher: Yes much better yes ...you;ve got the idea...change the one i've just given you\nteacher: Rememeber after a modal verb (can/might/shall etc) you need the infinitive\nstudent: money should be spent on public services such as schools and hospitals?\nstudent: I am not sure.\nteacher: OK Emily - you've gone a bit crazy there! Hold on ...come back! So, you can keep money as the first word...so 'Money should______ spent on schools and hospitals' What's the missing word?\nteacher: A tiny little word....!\nstudent: Money should be spent on schools and hospitals.\nteacher: yes great!\nteacher: OK?\nstudent: ok\nteacher: OK great ..let's have a break ..see you in 15 mins alright?\nstudent: I have understood.\nstudent: ok, see you\nteacher: ok",
    "teacher: Welcome back Michael Smith...\nstudent: hi\nstudent: I am back.\nteacher: OK great so...one second\nstudent: ok\nteacher: The essay title was basically: 'The government spends too much on midlife..' right? so rephrase that (more or less) with the following keywords. (Millions/every year/saving widlife)\nteacher: DO NOT mention the government!\nteacher: sorry 'wildlife' both times!\nstudent: Millions are spent on saving wildlife every year.\nteacher: the thing that is spent - is it wildlife?!\nteacher: What can be spent?\nstudent: Millions are spent on wildlife protection every year.\nteacher: Ok Michael Smith...this is really important...let's take this slowly ....i know this is difficult and VERY different from CHinese....hold on\nstudent: ok..I will try\nteacher: People spend money. (people = agent...the agent does the action) ok?\nstudent: yes, it is ok\nteacher: OK fine...so we can also say: MOney....?\nstudent: money should be spent on wildlife protection?\nstudent: spent\nteacher: OK good yes\nteacher: hold on..\nteacher: So : people spend money' in the passive = Money is spent\nteacher: and in our example now: 'Millions are spent on wildlife protection every year.' = good yes\nteacher: OK Michael Smith thanks ...let's a little change now OK?\nstudent: ok\nteacher: Did we practice essay introductions yet? I don't think so...right?\nstudent: we learned about task 1 introduction in class\nteacher: Ah yes that's right - let's have a little think about essay introductions OK?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: OK great so Michael Smith I'm going to suggest the following to practise for effective intros...\nteacher: Two sentences only!\nstudent: we have learned  \\It is often argued that the most effective way to lead a healthy lifestyle is regular exercise\\\"\"\nteacher: the first one is the 'background' sentence and the second is the 'thesis' sentence (thesis just means your idea basically)\nstudent: something like that..\nteacher: Are yes that's right! Did i describe it as a background and thesis sentence before?\nstudent: yes\nstudent: Although I strongly agree with the idea that exercise plays a major/crucial/significant/ role.\nteacher: OK fine so...let's try te same model for this essay about wildlife OK?\nstudent: is this it?\nstudent: ok\nteacher: Yes that's right\nteacher: OK so the original essay question today was : IT is often said that the government spends too much on projects to protect wildlife and that other problems are more important. Do you agree?\nteacher: Let's try an intro for this question together OK?\nstudent: ok\nteacher: OK so one thing we can do is to think of synonyms for the keywords in the question (you know what synonyms are right?)\nteacher: Words that mean the same thing. So 'large' is a synonym of 'big'.\nstudent: maybe it like protect wildlife = wildlife protection\nteacher: Yes that's a great example!\nteacher: Can you try some more for some of the other words - you can choose simple synonyms if you like ..that's fine\nstudent: spend = waste\nteacher: Yes OK good if you mean it negatively...keep going...\nstudent: important = necessary\nteacher: ok great\nteacher: more more!\nstudent: problem = issue\nteacher: fine\nstudent: I think that's all\nteacher: yes that was good thanks\nstudent: so.. should I just replace those words in the question?\nteacher: So we can say for example: 'Many people argue that millions _____  ______ on wildlife protection and it is _______ to spend more on other ________. I strongly with this idea and I will explain why in this essay.'\nteacher: Use your words to complete this introduction!\nteacher: I mean the synonyms you suggested before\nstudent: Many people argue that millions are spent on wildlife protection and it is necessary to spend money on other issues.\nteacher: OK yes that's great ....what about your synonym for 'spend'? IN this example you've used spend twice\nstudent: Many people argue that millions are wasted on wildlife protection and it is necessary to spend money on other issues.\nteacher: OK that's a great intro Michael Smith - this model should make it easier for you to write more or less any essay for IELTS OK?\nstudent: ok. that's great, I like using it\nteacher: Can i give you another essay question and ask you to try writing another two-sentence introduction?\nteacher: Are you ready?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: In some cities and towns the volume of traffic is a problem. What are the causes of this and what actions can be taken to solve it?\nteacher: You can check synonyms with me first if you like Michael Smith or just write the intro - I don;t mind you decide!\nteacher: Maybe just go for it OK?\nstudent: yes I want to check first\nteacher: Oh OK fine - yes check with me first then!\nstudent: towns = outskirts\nteacher: Um...well 'the outskirts of a town/city' just means around the edge of a town/city NOT the town/city itself so no, this is not good here I''m afriad\nstudent: problem = question\nstudent: town = village\nteacher: What's bigger - a town or a village?\nstudent: country\nstudent: I am not sure which one is bigger.\nteacher: A village is a very small place, often in the countryside!\nstudent: maybe it is town\nteacher: yes town!\nteacher: Michael Smith do you know the adjective 'rural'?\nstudent: yes, rural area\nteacher: OK great phrase yes! So, what's the opposite of 'rural'?!\nteacher: It begins with 'u'!\nteacher: urb...?\nstudent: urban\nteacher: urba..????\nstudent: urban\nstudent: urban areas\nteacher: yes that's it..and you can add you 'areas' idea = perfect\nteacher: so 'urban areas' = good\nstudent: ok\nteacher: what about 'solve' - can you change that?\nstudent: cause = reason.   action = approach\nstudent: solve = address\nteacher: OK good ideas yes thanks!\nteacher: OK so are you ready to have a go at the intro now?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: OK\nteacher: Sorry Michael Smith - maybe use 'issue' and not 'question'!\nstudent: it is argued that there are many traffic issues in urban areas.\nteacher: OK thanks Michael Smith... this is a fact rather than an opinion in the essay title OK?\nstudent: ok\nteacher: So let's just say: ''There are many traffic issues in urban areas'\nteacher: (Cities are urban areas too)\nstudent: ok\nteacher: So OK that's a background sentence\nteacher: Your thesis sentence next!\nteacher: The one where you give your own idea right?\nteacher: And here it's what you think the causes/solutinos are!\nteacher: Tell me what you think first Michael Smith just in easy language just a quick idea OK?\nteacher: OF you've already started the intro sentnce don't worry finish that first\nstudent: ok, money should be spent on public transport.\nteacher: OK great thanks that's fine..one more idea?\nstudent: renewable electricity cars.\nstudent: no. nono..\nteacher: OK but how would that reduce the number of cars?\nteacher: Yes I think you see the problem maybe?\nstudent: come up with ways to limit cars on the roads.\nteacher: yes good - how?\nstudent: introduce a law\nteacher: OK fine so just directly banning some cars or whatever right? OK yes\nstudent: to ban too many cars on the roads everyday.\nteacher: OK great ...Michael Smith let me ask you to finish that intro (with the second sentence) and tell me on Monday OK?\nstudent: OK, no problem\nteacher: You've done really well Michael Smith....it takes a lot of concentration in this format ...well done\nstudent: have a good weekend!!!\nteacher: OK thanks a lot and you if you can bye bye\nstudent: thanks a lot\nstudent: bye",
    "teacher: Hi Emma Johnson!\nstudent: Hi Mrs. Wilson.\nteacher: Sorry about yesterday...how are things with you?\nstudent: Don't worry\nstudent: I'm ok, how about you?\nstudent: I read that Boris J. has coronavirus!!\nteacher: Yes fine thanks - still really busy bizarrely bu that's goign to change pretty soon! Yes I saw that earlier..\nteacher: only mild symptoms apparently\nstudent: ahh\nteacher: I'm sure he'll be fine...I think he's a survivor...\nstudent: I hope so\nteacher: political and otherwise\nteacher: yes well - he's quite a controversial figure in some ways but maybe a good leader in a crisis\nteacher: and obviously  I don't want him to you know....!\nstudent: Actually I don't know anything about him\nteacher: Oh right... well he's a toff ...do you know what i mean?\nstudent: toff??\nteacher: It means posh...so he went to Eton and has a posh accent/way of acting you see?\nstudent: yes, I just checked!\nteacher: toff' is a bit negative - i just used it to share the word!\nteacher: It is common though\nstudent: ok\nteacher: BUT he does have the ability to connect with all kinds of people actually - a very skilled politician\nteacher: right-wing\nteacher: that's why he's divisive\nteacher: but he's got the gift of the gab\nstudent: divisive? I'll check this word in or on?? the dictionary\nteacher: ability to speak well/easily and get people to side with you\nteacher: Oh sorry ...leading to division\nteacher: often possible instead of controversial i guess\nstudent: causing disagreement (dictionary says)\nteacher: in the dictionary\nstudent: thanks\nteacher: yes I like my definition because it gives you the link with the noun division!\nteacher: Hey Emma Johnson i'm not really sure about poshness in Spain - i mean if it has the same role in society if you see what i mean\nstudent: I haven't heard any good things about him so far, all my English friends were very unhappy when he won the elections.. and now they are not happy either because it took him too long to restrict people's lives in this situation...\nteacher: Yes i see - well I guess your English friends are probably a bit more on the left...\nstudent: yes\nstudent: about poshness (does this word exist? haha)\nstudent: I think it's similar in Spain\nstudent: or the same\nteacher: I could see when some people on TV or whatever were kind of posh from their clothes/behaviour but not from their accent which is a big giveaway in Britain\nteacher: Yes I was going to ask you this (see my cpoy and pasted comment above!)\nteacher: So i could see some similarities i guess\nteacher: yes poshness is fine (but posh much more common )\nteacher: But can you hear from accent?\nteacher: It;s not the same as being rich - you know that right? AS in if you're working class and win the lottery you don't become posh!\nstudent: Yes, the accent, the way people use the language, the vocabulary, etc. says a lot about how posh or maybe how educated people are... Is it the same?? Can you be posh and not educated in England? In Spain if you are just rich it is very different, being posh is not the same as being rich\nstudent: haha I just read what you wrote about being rich and posh, exactly the same in Spain\nteacher: OK right so maybe quite similar overall then - ah yes I see what you say - exactly the same- the thing about educated ...um...well there's a correlation i guess BUT not complete...\nteacher: So e.g. you can be posh but thick!  And you can be educated and working class!\nstudent: Yes, I understand. Maybe I didn't explain myself very well... you definitely can be educated and not posh\nteacher: Do you know what I think IS different Emma Johnson? It's not the basic idea of poshness ...it's the fact that I have a feeling that the all the little levels in between are finer in the UK (more than anywhere maybe!) so e.g. there's a whole 'middle class' thing going on too with lots of little cultural rules etc\nstudent: What does 'thick' mean in your sentence??\nteacher: Yes no I see what you mean about he educated/posh thing - i realise you weren't being so simplistic\nteacher: so stupid is general - dumb = informal american and thick = informal British\nstudent: so thick is a less rude way of saying stupid?\nteacher: not less rude actually! just another word....\nteacher: not very bright' = less direct!\nteacher: you know bright means clever right?\nstudent: I see\nteacher: smart' in the US and 'bright' in the UK\nstudent: Yes, I like that word (bright)\nteacher: yes really common  - sounds natural\nteacher: most non-native won't use it they always say clever/intelligent etc\nstudent: don't you use intelligent?\nteacher: Oh sorry yes we do use those words too....\nteacher: just not always - as in we also say bright'\nstudent: when I worked at school there I remember teachers using the word 'bright' much more\nteacher: OR e.g. 'switched on' etc etc etc\nteacher: Yes I think you're right - in normal everyday speaking bright is raelly common - maybe 'intelligent' sounds more formal\nstudent: more than 'intelligent', I mean\nteacher: well yes it is definitely\nstudent: yes, I think so\nstudent: Spanish people prefer (I guess) 'intelligent' because we have the same word in Spanish\nteacher: Yes sure I see what you mean\nteacher: Hey Emma Johnson do you remember the names of any supermarkets in the UK?\nstudent: yes! Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's, Iceland, Aldi..\nstudent: I love visiting supermarkets when I travel (I know, it sounds weird)\nteacher: Good memory! No it's not weird I;m the same! Well do you know which one is posh?\nteacher: Actually you didn't mention a posh one in your list!\nstudent: Yes, I don't know how to write it\nstudent: Waitrose\nstudent: something like that haha\nteacher: Yes that's it...Waitrose\nstudent: and Marks and Spencer\nteacher: And e.g. M and S (MArks and Spencers)\nstudent: Spencer\nteacher: Ha!\nstudent: yes, you can see it when you get in\nteacher: You remember them all\nstudent: Yes, I lived there for 5 years...\nteacher: So there really is a strict hierarchy according to how posh they are you know?\nstudent: And the school where I worked was quite posh\nteacher: oh right\nstudent: and one year for Christmas I got a voucher for Waitrose, imagine haha\nteacher: Well my daughter goes to a posh school (private) and once I saw the mum of a schoolfriend of hers in Asda and do you know what she did?  (Nice present!)\nteacher: She blushed!\nstudent: hahahaha\nteacher: ACtually i should say for the record that I shop at Waitrose normally!\nstudent: So, you are posh! ;)\nteacher: Not because I'm posh exactly but because I'm a food snob (i spend more than the average proportion of my income on nice food\nteacher: I suffer in England! (foodwise)\nstudent: I think here it's a bit different... Maybe Supercor is more posh than others supermarkets, but among the others there are not many differences\nteacher: Yes right - I think that was my point earlier ----there are fewer fine differences you know?\nteacher: Cos for example one person will feel comfortable in Sainsbury's but NOT in Asda!\nstudent: Yes, now I know what you mean... but here we also have certain things that set people apart. For example the gym you go, the restaurants, the cinema, the beauty salon (or whatever it is called)...\nteacher: The other day in a class Emma Johnson I had a look at a website with students which was funny - it had 'things overheard at Waitrose' things taht were funny because they demonstarted the snobbishness of the customers - put those search terms in Google or whatever and you 'll find it - it's good  - you'll see lots of idiomatic language etc\nstudent: It's so sad that people feel embarrassed to be seen at a supermarket, don't you think??\nteacher: Yes 'beauty salon' is fine - yes I see what you mean about those places - I guess i'd see more differences with more experience/knowledge\nteacher: Yes it is sad I guess - not every English person is like that of course BUT it is something that we're kind of born with you know? Well obviously not born with but quickly become aware o\nteacher: IT;s kind of funny too though!\nstudent: yes, I see...\nteacher: And we take the piss out of ourselves a lot over it so it's not that bad!\nstudent: I like the fun side of it\nteacher: IF you watch English TV e.g. comedy you'll see that a lot of the humor often comes from class differences - and in an affectionate way often\nteacher: you what i mean with affectionate right?\nstudent: I can't watch English TV from Spain unfortunately, I'd like to notice it\nteacher: Ah right - well, lots of stuff on youtube I guess...but maybe difficult to know what to choose....\nstudent: Yes, I think (with affectionate) you mean than it's not in an offensive way?\nteacher: no exactly - in fact quite the opposite - with feelings of fondness/love\nteacher: gentle love!\nstudent: now I know\nteacher: I'm planning to watch some Spanish stand-up - i watched some several years ago and i found it fascinating (both for language learning and the cultural side of things)\nteacher: even if i didn't always find it funny if you see what i mean\nstudent: El club de la comedia is very good\nteacher: Yes I saw some of that\nteacher: You know one bug thing about lots of British humour is of course that it's really black/sarcastic etc\nteacher: sorry big thin\nteacher: AAahhhh! big thing\nstudent: I don't enjoy watching stand-up, I find it very difficult to undestand\nteacher: you mean in English?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: right! just checking!\nstudent: I love comedy but in Spanish!\nstudent: Could you understand el club de la comedia??\nteacher: well some of it! I did get lost occasionally!\nteacher: I did spend 3 years in Spain (just a long time ago...)\nteacher: I played some students some stand-up by 'Stewart Lee' the other week and they didn't even recognise it as comedy - it's so dark - they thought it was just a man shouting!\nstudent: That's very good, I imagine it's not easy to understand because generally they use a lot of slang and they speak very quickly\nteacher: which it kind of is\nteacher: yes of course - it is very challenging - yes the speed seems to be a thing with comedy doesn't?\nstudent: hahaha that's funny (just a man shouting)\nstudent: yes, it's usually very fast\nteacher: You know what they say about English people? When they joke they're being serious and when they speak seriously they're joking\nteacher: not everyone - but me for example - yes it's often true\nstudent: I'm glad you reminded me of El club de la comedia, I should watch a bit everyday now that we are having difficult times :)\nteacher: yes you're right - maybe comedy is the way to go - just months of comedy - however stupid it is!\nteacher: All those dumb American comedies- bring it on\nstudent: Is that last sentence correct?? you reminded me??\nteacher: yes it was...but sorry no hold on - reminded me OF club = correct\nstudent: I'm trying to watch 'feel good' series, I don't want more drama after watching the news a few times a day...\nteacher: I think I put the preposition in by mistake if i try to say that IN spanish .....\nteacher: Yes I understand...'feel-good' = great adective\nstudent: So, I should have said 'I'm glad you reminded me of El club...\nteacher: yes exactly\nstudent: Thanks\nteacher: you must include 'of'\nteacher: I'm planning to learn more languages - when i have more time (very soon)\nstudent: I'd love to but I think I still have a lot of English to learn... I believe my idea is wrong because I could spend all my life learning just one language\nstudent: a lot of\nstudent: What languages would you like to learn?\nteacher: yes i see what you mean - although I reckon that maybe learning for example a third language might make you better at your second if you see what i mean? Well I want to have a go at Japanese\nstudent: really?? Japanese must be very hard...\nteacher: It's actually quite easy to get going because the pronunciation is quite straight-forward you see - i've learned some Arabic which is interesting but the pronunciation is a nightmare\nteacher: Of course some things in Japanese are not easy! the writing for ecample\nteacher: But if you learn a sentence you can just say it and the y will understand you which is very satisfying\nstudent: You are very brave! Arabic, Japanese... I see Japanese writing as drawing\nteacher: yes - just pictures - a challenge to rememember!\nstudent: Yes, I see what you mean. It's very frustrating when you say something and people don't understand you\nteacher: I'm good at remembering word forms in different languages but the pictures are tough! Arabic is just an alphabet so it's actually not really very hard you see?\nteacher: Yes sure....\nstudent: Well, if we have to stay at home for longer, you'll have plenty of time to draw your letters :)\nteacher: Yes there's lots of apps for it now ....OK Emma Johnson I guess we'll call it a day - I'l l emial you very soon with suggest times OK ? take care bye\nteacher: suggested times I mean\nstudent: Great, thank you very much!\nteacher: ok cheers\nstudent: bye",
    "student: Good afternoon Ms. Johnson.\nteacher: Good afternoon to you Emily Smith - all OK with you?\nstudent: how was your interview today?\nteacher: Ah well in the end it was cancelled so I've had a free hour ....\nteacher: I've been helping my daughter with her homework.\nstudent: yes, today the UK time has changed, I'm a little bit confused\nstudent: wow, that was great\nteacher: Oh yes of course - did you get the time wrong for your morning lesson?\nstudent: of course, I was an hour late.\nteacher: Oh no! Yes I thought of warning you by email about the time change...but i didn't of course\nteacher: The school should have thought of that I think!\nstudent: because the time difference has changed from 8 hours to 7 hours.\nteacher: Yes sure - So actually it's quite a late start for you\nstudent: yes..but it is ok, because I've changed the time on my computer into the UK time.\nteacher: OK good idea\nstudent: now I can be on time everyday.\nteacher: So you're still in quarantine right?\nstudent: it is a really effective way\nstudent: yes, I have one more a week\nteacher: Right - is it difficult or are you coping ok?\nstudent: I suppose I have had a better lifestyle during the quarantine, haha...\nteacher: Ha! Really? Because you have a healthier  diet?!\nstudent: Because nurses provide meals on time every day, and I can do everything on time, such as reading, learning and so on. Just one thing I have to obey, which is stay in my room\nteacher: Ah right - so you can be more self-disciplined - you have a structure to your day...I guess maybe all the English classes you;re having help maybe?\nstudent: I really have a healthier lifestyle than before. For example, I drink a lot of water every day and do more indoor physical activities.\nteacher: Sounds good - what kind of exercise are you doing?\nstudent: of course, in particular your English class is the best one\nstudent: sorry, I lost my internet\nteacher: no problem - I got your praise before it cut out!\nteacher: So Emily Smith - to get going can I give you an esay question and ask you to give me some synonyms you could use in your two-sentence intro?\nstudent: like push-ups..which can improve my muscles,..haha\nstudent: yes, let's start\nteacher: OK right! Well good luck with that  - although you have to keep going for more than a week I guess....\nteacher: OK here's the question hold on\nteacher: Our personalities are predetermined as a result of our genes and there is nothing we can do to change them. To what extent do you agree?\nstudent: personalities = characteristics\nstudent: predetermined = forecast\nteacher: ok keep going and I'll give you feedback on the group of words in a minute\nstudent: change = transform\nstudent: as a result = as a consequence\nstudent: can = be able to\nstudent: I think that's all\nteacher: OK thanks Emily Smith hold on a sec...\nteacher: change one of your ideas to 'fixed' - which one is it?\nstudent: change?\nstudent: I think it is a verb, so it is maybe 'charge'.\nstudent: change\nteacher: Ah ok - well 'fix' has two meanings ...1=repair something that's broken and 2= establish/set etc i.e. determine\nteacher: so you can say our personality is 'fixed'\nstudent: ok, I got it.\nteacher: as a synonym for 'predetermined'\nteacher: transform = good idea but...it means change completely ...can you think of a less extreme synonym ?\nteacher: beginning with 'a' ?!\nstudent: switch\nteacher: beginning with'a' ...?\nteacher: al...@?\nstudent: alter\nstudent: we learnt it in class\nteacher: yes OK - that's good as a general synonym for change\nteacher: and good here too\nstudent: ok\nteacher: switch ' is like one specific to another specific thing do you see ?\nteacher: like from your left hand to your right hand for example\nteacher: OK look at these two words: character and characteristic - which one is one particular presonality feature and which one is the whole group together and best as a synonym for 'personality'\nstudent: yes..\nteacher: Sorry that was a question before! Did you follow it?\nstudent: I suppose 'character' means one particular personality feature, while 'characteristic' means a group.\nstudent: so maybe it is character\nteacher: Well .... character = more general\nteacher: and best here as a general synonym\nstudent: ok..I understand thanks\nteacher: as a consequence = good! and be able to = fine but be careful ...remember it's the infinitive of 'can'\nteacher: what about this idea of 'genes' - this a noun what's the adjective?\nstudent: I think it is a noun\nteacher: yes you're right...what's the adjective?\nstudent: generous?\nstudent: it's just come to my mind\nteacher: Ha! I see the similarity in the spelling! THis is the adjective of 'generosity' = the opposite of selfish....but the adjective for 'gene' is 'genetic'\nstudent: ok, I'll write them down in my note book\nteacher: OK other useful words for this question Emily Smith might be e.g. : 'born with' , 'innate' (=adjective meaning born with!)\nteacher: Where do you get your genes from?!\nstudent: I think it must be from parents.\nteacher: yes absolutely! So your parents pass on their genes OK? Another way of saying this = You _____ your genes/character from you r parents(like money when they die!)\nteacher: sorry 'pass on' = phrasal verb in my example (maybe genetically maybe just information etc and the one-word verb i;m looking for in the second part = ?  )\nteacher: For example: 'When my father died I __________ a million pounds!'?\nteacher: inh_ _  _ _ '?\nstudent: when my father died I inherited a million pounds.\nteacher: Yes OK great! So you inherit particular characteristics from you parents (maybe!) including e.g. physical ones like e.g. eye colour or e.g. a musical talent or whatever OK?\nteacher: What would you say you have inherited from you parents (if anything?)\nstudent: yes,ok\nstudent: yes, ok\nstudent: I would say the ways to solve problems.\nteacher: Sorry internet out for a minute there....hol don\nstudent: ok\nteacher: Yes great example - so  the ability to solve problems or e.g. problem-solving ability/skills\nteacher: Any examples of ways in which you are DIFFERENT from your parents?!\nstudent: ok, so I'm really cautious with vocabulary when I want to describe some abilities which I inherited from my parents.\nteacher: Sorry  Emily Smith what do you mean here?\nteacher: YOu mean you don't want to say bad things about your parents??!\nstudent: I mean 'way' cannot be used here to explain something that came from parents\nteacher: Oh i see sorry - yes I guess you;re right! you inherit an ability/talent etc = the collocation!\nteacher: one more potentially useful word Emily Smith is connected to this idea of \u2018before you were born\u2019 in the question ...so \u2018when you were born\u2019 = your \u2018______\u2019? One-word noun needed here! What is it?\nteacher: For example...pregnant womenoften go to hospital to give _____?\nteacher: beginning with 'b_ _ _ _ '!\nstudent: begin\nteacher: Good try! 'birth' is the word here...\nstudent: ok\nteacher: so e.g. before birth/at birth/after birth\nteacher: OK Emily Smith - let's have a break...see you in 15 mins OK? Bye fo rnow\nteacher: for now!\nstudent: ok, see you",
    "teacher: Welcome back Samantha...\nstudent: hey, I am here\nteacher: OK a quick vocabulary exercise for you based on earlier ... hold on\nstudent: ok\nteacher: Just match up the letters and numbers and show me OK? Take a couple of minutes and if you aren't sure no problem: 1. change 2. personality (in general) 3. be born 4. predetermined 5. get from (e.g. parents) 6. give to (e.g. children) 7. characteristic (e.g. one particular example) 8. things that are the same  9. to be born with   a. pass on b. fixed c. alter d. similarities e. innate  f. birth g. character h. inherit i. quality\nteacher: Is that clear?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: ok\nstudent: 1- c / 2 - g / 3 - f / 4 - b / 5 - h / 6 - a / 7 -  e / 8 - d / 9 - f\nstudent: I am not sure of number 7\nteacher: OK thanks Samantha - very good overall hold on...\nteacher: ok\nteacher: so 'innate' = something your born with e.g. Children seem to have an innate sense of fairness. And e.g. patience, honesty, a sense of humour  are all examples of particular personal qualities or characteristics (OK?!)\nteacher: So 7 = i and 9 = e !\nstudent: ok, I'll write them down in my notebook\nteacher: OK great - OK can I give you one final test now - you will need one word from the second group to complete the following sentences\nteacher: 1. My father ___________ his love of fishing to me and my brother.. 2. Our personalities are __________, perhaps not from ________, but certainly when we reach adulthood. 3. Beethoven\u2019s musical talent was ________. He could compose symphonies from the age of four! 4. Honesty and kindness are very important __________. 5. It\u2019s very difficult or perhaps impossible to __________ your character \u2013 your genes play a very significant role.\nteacher: OK? One word from the SECOND group...\nstudent: ok, I know the second group is from a to i\nteacher: yes that's it\nstudent: 1. pass on  2. similarities / inherit 3. birth  4.character  5.  alter\nteacher: OK thanks Samantha - good answers for 1 and 5. let me make the other examples clearer\nstudent: ok\nteacher: So number you need an adjective which means 'something that is set/that you can't change...and the next word in number two means 'from the first day of you life'! NUmber 3: his talent was something he was born with e.g. 'an i_ _ _ _ _ 'talent'. and number 4: kindness etc ...these are particular characteristics or 'qu.........'?!\nteacher: Sorry the first comment connects to number 2 ok?\nstudent: innate quality\nteacher: OK Samantha ..so number 2: IF i say our personalities can't be changed I can say: 'Our personalities are 'f _ _ _ _ '?\nstudent: our personalities are fixed\nteacher: yes good ...and maybe not from ' b _ _ _ _ ' but quite soon afterwards?\nstudent: birth\nteacher: ok yes 'birth'\nteacher: AND number 3: Beethoven;s talent was 'i _ _ _ _ ' ?\nteacher: It means something he was born with!\nstudent: innate\nteacher: ok great! And e.g. patience/honesty/kindness/selfishness etc are ....?\nstudent: character\nteacher: you need a COUNTABLE noun here ...so e.g. 'character' is not possible (at least in this context) - a person's character is made up of different _______?\nteacher: Qu....' or 'ch...' = both possible\nstudent: qualities\nstudent: characters\nteacher: yes good ...or characteristics ...OK? Both are countable and mean particular features ...your CHARACTER or PERSONALITY = uncountable (at least for one person they are uncountable )\nteacher: So in other words a person's character or personality includes different specific qualities or characteristics (OK?)\nstudent: not ok\nteacher: Ha!\nteacher: Hold on...\nstudent: we can only write characteristics here\nteacher: No 'qualities' is OK too = the same thing\nteacher: Oh sorry yes you can't write character\nteacher: character is formed by a GROUP of characteristics\nstudent: ok, I got it. thanks\nteacher: OK cool - so final answers for the record = 1. My father PASSED ON  his love of fishing to me and my brother.. 2. Our personalities are FIXED perhaps not from BIRTH but certainly when we reach adulthood. 3. Beethoven\u2019s musical talent was INNATE He could compose symphonies from the age of four! 4. Honesty and kindness are very important QUALITIES. 5. It\u2019s very difficult or perhaps impossible to ALTER your character \u2013 your genes play a very significant role.\nteacher: Are you able to copy and paste from this box Samantha?\nteacher: I mean without writing with a pen\nstudent: Not easily, but I will practice to remember them in my mind\nteacher: OK fine - I'll consider using material that i can maybe send you in an email first OK? It might be easier for you...\nstudent: yes, that would be great, I think it can be easier too\nstudent: thanks\nteacher: So Samantha if you can, write a two-sentence introduction for the original essay question from earlier today OK? Don't worry too much about 'difficult' words OK? Just be direct and clear if you can....remember the question&gt; Here it is: Our personalities are predetermined as a result of our genes and there is nothing we can do to change them. To what extent do you agree?\nteacher: I'll give you a couple of minutes OK?\nteacher: Remember: one background sentence and one 'thesis sentence!\nstudent: ok\nteacher: ok\nstudent: It is argued that our characteristics are fixed  and we are not able to alter them. Although I strongly agree whit the idea that genes play a significant role, learning is more important.\nteacher: OK thanks a lot Samantha - you've really tried to copy the idea of the model we look at before with IELTS introductions in general and I think that's great so well done\nteacher: YOu might feel this is too short/simple but trust me it;s a good start!\nstudent: ok, thanks a lot\nteacher: Good use of keywords too....\nteacher: So it is argued that our characteristics are fixed and we are not able to alter _____ (plural pronoun?!). Although I strongly agree whit ('with' + noun - do you need it here? )that genes play a significant role, learning afterward is more important.\nteacher: significant role' + good too by the way!\nteacher: sorry = good I wanted to say\nstudent: It is argued that our characteristics are fixed and we are not able to alter our qualities.\nstudent: Although I strongly agree with the idea that genes play a significant role, learning is more important.\nteacher: OK thanks Samantha, so here's the two little changes I sas thinking of and also a suggestion for developing the end a little bit: It is sometimes argued that our characteristics are fixed and we are not able to alter them. Although I strongly agree that genes play a significant role, our learning and experience after birth is more important in forming our personalities. OK?!!\nstudent: yes, that is perfect\nteacher: So in other words 'them' instead of 'it' (because characteristics is plural) and delete 'with' because you're using a subject/verb structure so you on'y need : I agree that.....\nteacher: BUT a good intro overall Samantha - you;re on the right track OK?\nstudent: I think writing in this way is more academic than the way I wrote before.\nteacher: OK fine - I guess that's it for today Samantha - thanks. So I'll speak to you tomorrow from 14:00 ...bye\nstudent: ok, bye\nteacher: cheers...\nstudent: good night",
    "teacher: Hi Rachel Smith, ready when you are....\nstudent: Hi Ms. Thompson, I'm ready\nteacher: OK cool - I wondered if you fancied having a go at some CAE-type speaking questions? WE;; not exactly 'speaking' of course but you know what I mean....\nstudent: yes, let's try!!\nteacher: OK great..so in the exam you only have a couple of minutes but you can have longer for vocab purposes! What is the appeal of these jobs?: politician, football player, judge,surgeon , teacher\nteacher: I'll give you a minute to formulate an idea!\nstudent: By the way, I remember that when I filled the form to take part in this study one of the questions was about having speaking classes... Do you know if there will be those classes in the future?\nteacher: Um...I'm not sure about that actually .....let me get back to you on that OK? I'll ask...\nstudent: Ok thank you!!\nteacher: ok\nstudent: I'm sorry but I don't really understand the question... Do you mean 'what makes people feel attracted to working as a politician, football player, etc'?\nteacher: Yes that's it exactly...so 'appeal' in this context is as you say: what attracts them/what is the attraction etc to/of thi sjob\nstudent: I see, thanks\nteacher: the verb appeal = much more common than attract in this context by the way\nteacher: Structure : I'm attracted to x. = ok but 'x attracts me' correct but less normal\nteacher: x appeals to me' = normal\nstudent: I think that people who choose to become a politician are very interested in society, in how things work\nstudent: uff it's difficult to explain\nstudent: I'll try\nteacher: ok\nstudent: by the way 'people who choose to become politicians or a politician'?\nteacher: both= ok/possible!\nstudent: I think they feel they have better ideas about how to organise the way our society  works and want to be heard\nstudent: Really bad but I don't know how to express myself :(\nteacher: No that's ok...it's not an easy question! we'll come back to it if you like - carry on with another job if you want...\nstudent: sure\nteacher: ok\nteacher: by the way you don't have to do the jobs in order\nstudent: I guess that football players choose their professions because they are very talented and they really enjoy playing football.\nteacher: ok...why might they enjoy it for example?\nteacher: I know I know ...not something you go around thinking aboutnormally!\nstudent: I guess they love exercising, being part of a team, being outdoors ... I don't know\nteacher: Yes ok fine ...so I'll come back to those ideas with some language points in a bit ok? Keep going - any order...\nstudent: I also think that they know that if they are very good they could have a very good salary\nteacher: ok good point yeah!\nstudent: yes please, I'm sure there are a lot of 'language points' to review...\nteacher: :)\nstudent: About surgeons, I think that like any kind of doctor (or kind, not sure about the use of the plural of this word) they really care about people so that's why they choose that profession\nstudent: haha so difficult... don't know what else to say\nteacher: OK thanks...(kind = correct in singular after 'any' in this context)\nstudent: ahhh ok\nteacher: that's ok! judge or teacher next!\nstudent: Teacher!\nteacher: OK go for it!\nstudent: I also think that teachers choose their profession because they really care about people's well-being. I guess they enjoy learning and  passing on their knowledge\nteacher: yes of course, always :)\nstudent: Generally teachers are very sociable and I think that they also decide to teach as a way of being around people and getting to learn new thing from them\nteacher: yes good point\nstudent: I finished :)\nstudent: I've finished!\nstudent: both correct??\nteacher: I've finished = good I finished = not wrong but much much less common\nstudent: ok\nteacher: I'm finished = also OK but again, less common\nteacher: I thought that might be your next question- I was trying to be clever and pre-empt it (it's a common one!)\nstudent: pre-empt??\nstudent: predict\nteacher: yeah sorry =do something to prevent an anticipated event Thanks Rachel Smith - I know it's tough to think on the spot and also in this format  you feel like you should answer quickly etc well-being/want to be heard by the way I liked!\nstudent: Oh thank you... I found it very difficult, I felt stressed haha\nstudent: I think I would feel more comfortable talking about this topic than writing\nstudent: To be honest I don't know what to say about judges... what do you think??\nteacher: AAhhhhh! hold on\nstudent: ok\nteacher: OK no this box doesn;t like it - I don't know why - the keywords to serach are: BNC BYU corpus\nstudent: I'll have a look\nteacher: ok\nstudent: I wrote the word pre-empt\nteacher: Sorry Rachel Smith - clumsy computer use ...ok here we go...a c ouple of quick things before i forget: being in touch? being around other people = good/normal  passing on their knowledge\nteacher: Oh sorry yes OK - you're searching for something on the site ..good!\nstudent: taking about the site, are the sentences that are shown with the word from texts??\nstudent: Are all correct? I mean, the sentences...\nteacher: yes it's called a concordance - have you seen one before? It just has a massive database of spoken and written texts from different sources and searches them for you\nteacher: well, they're basically 'correct' yes - 'authentic' at least\nteacher: For me Rachel Smith it's like a dictionary but better you know\nteacher: I use them when i can if I learn a language\nstudent: I see, thank you! I generally use linguee, do you know this one?? I think it's the same idea but I always wonder if the texts they show are reliable...\nstudent: www.linguee.es\nteacher: If you want to know what a word 'means' then looking at a page like that ....THAT'S what it means! Hey, try one more word ...try e.g. 'vivid' what are collocations you get (what are the subsequent nouns I mean? the same handful again and again right? Yes I know linguee - yes it's similar ...maybe not quite as good in my opinion but definitely useful\nstudent: I'll use BNC from now, thank you\nteacher: not quite as good because I have the feeling it;s a smaller database/fewer example seem to apear - i like this bnc one because it just gives you a massive sheet - bit overwhelming for many students but you'll be OK :)\nstudent: Wow, amazing!! I just checked collocations for vivid\nteacher: yes go on...\nstudent: sorry, what shall I do now?\nteacher: Oh sorry - i thought you were going to say something about 'vivid' collcaotions...hold on a sec\nteacher: Befroe i forget: being in touch? being around other people = good/normal  passing on their knowledge\nteacher: is that clear? these were a couple of things you wrote earlier ...so you need to add 'on' e.g. pass on their knowledge\nstudent: Ohh sorry, I was lost\nstudent: Yes, clear\nteacher: OK so I;ve copied your answers from earlier so I;ll go back to them tomorrow ok?\nstudent: I wasn't sure about it and I even checked in the dictionary... So you pass on knowledge but you pass the salt at the table??\nteacher: Yes that's it\nstudent: Great, we'll speak about it tomorrow!\nteacher: ok ...speak to you soon bye\nstudent: Bye, thank you!!",
    "student: Good afternoon Ms. Roberts.\nteacher: Hi there Emily Johnson, how's it going?\nstudent: yes, I am fine\nstudent: and you?\nteacher: yes all good here thanks...how are you finding the lessons on Zoom - very different from the face to face classes?\nstudent: I suppose lessons on Zoom are worse than face-to-face classes\nteacher: Yeah? I guess it must be ....'less better' = nice idea...you mean 'worse' or 'less good/not as good' I think!\nstudent: because it is not an effective way to study subjects, such as feedbacks are not quick\nstudent: I guess less good is suitable.\nteacher: Yes I guess it's difficult to give feedback - I see what you mean\nteacher: Hey Emily Johnson - I've just emailed you a file with some an exercsie connected to the pie charts we were looking at last week - is it easy for you to open that an look at it at the same time as talking to me?\nstudent: but I really like lessons here with you\nstudent: yes, I got it now.\nteacher: OK that's great! If you want to have a go at those now  I will give you the first word or words you need to start each sentence - you just need to continue and put he words in the correct order....try number one if you like now OK? Here are the first words....1. Australia... 2. Coal was\u2026..  3. Fifty units...  4. Australia relied on \u2026 5. Coal\u2026. 6. Coal was \u2026.  7. By 2000, coal \u2026 8. The proportion of electricity \u2026.\nteacher: OK so the first word for Number 1 is 'Australia' as you can see I hope!\nstudent: yes, I saw it\nteacher: I;ve emailed you the pie charts as a pdf too by the way if you need it\nstudent: yes, it is really clear\nteacher: ok cool - i'll give you a minute for the first one....\nstudent: In Australia coal was a significant electricity fuel in 1980, producing fifty percent. Australia still relied on coal for electricity production by 2000. The proportion of electricity produced from coal was 130 out of 170 units.\nstudent: I will rewrite this sentence.\nteacher: OK Emily Johnson hold on hold!\nstudent: ok\nteacher: You can use exactly the words in each number OK? Just out them in a diffferent order...hold on\nteacher: so for example number : you have ALL the words you need here: 1. its used to 50% Australia of electricity produce coal\nteacher: number 1 I mean! I;m just giving you a little bit of help by telling you the first word you need from the list ('Australia')\nstudent: ok, could I use  'Australia used coal to produce 50% of its electricityl'?\nteacher: OK so: 'Australia used....(you continue JUST with the words I've given you)...'\nteacher: START with the word 'Australia' - this gives you a good structure - that's why I;m giving you the first word for each one\nteacher: So you need a subject then verb right? So 'Australia used....' word three = the thing Australia used! (the object)\nstudent: Australia used coal to produce 50 per cent of its electricity.\nstudent: Australia used coal to produce 50 per cent of its electricity.\nteacher: So hold on Emily Johnson - let's take this one step at a time - it;s OK this is what you need to do\nteacher: So think about the basic structure of English OK? hold on...\nstudent: ok\nteacher: So when we use a verb we often need an object right?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: So for example: I make dinner every day\nteacher: so the noun dinner is the object of the verb 'make'  - it is the thing I make\nstudent: yes\nteacher: What does France produce for example? Think aoout food and drink....\nteacher: one example if you can\nstudent: whisky is produced in France.\nstudent: France produces whisky.\nteacher: OK thanks ...so we can say (let's forget about the passive for now OK?) Scotland produces whisky or e.g. France produces wine...both good examples ...what does France use to produce wine? Milk? Oranges? no.... 'it uses____________ to make wine'.\nteacher: which fruit?!\nstudent: it uses grapes to make wine\nteacher: OK thanks - crop = good word for food grown by farmers in general yes ...in this case it is grapes OK?\nteacher: So we can say that the noun 'grapes' is the object of 'use' right? They go together!\nstudent: yes..\nteacher: France uses grapes.' = good\nteacher: And the noun 'wine' goes with the verb 'produce' yes?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: So you complete this sentence if you can: 'France uses ______ to _______ wine'.\nstudent: France uses grapes to produce wine.\nteacher: OK great thanks! hold on...\nteacher: So going back to the first pie chart sentence we can say: 'Australia used ______ to ______ 50% of its electricity' - can you finish it? of\nstudent: Australia used coal to produce 50 percent of its electricity.\nteacher: OK great that's it ('used coal to produce' = good only the first verb needs to be in the past tense) well done\nteacher: Emily Johnson , can you please try number 5 now ok?\nstudent: ok\nteacher: Remember you have all the words you need!\nteacher: So first word = 'coal' and then you need a past simple verb next...\nstudent: coal used?\nteacher: I'm happy you're not sure about this idea Emily Johnson because you;re right it's wrong! BUT hold on a minute - have you got the list of mixed up words?\nstudent: coal was used to produce 130 out of 170 units of electricity?\nstudent: no I have not got the list of mixed up words.\nteacher: check your email!\nteacher: the first file before the pdf  .... have you got it?\nstudent: wow, yes..\nstudent: it is the answers\nteacher: No it;s not the answers - look carefully, it;s the owrds you need but mixed up/in the wrong order\nteacher: the words you need!\nstudent: Coal accounted for 50 percent of electricity production in Australia\nstudent: is it  'for' ?\nstudent: but it is not a verb\nteacher: So Emily Johnson ..after the noun coal you need a past simple verb remember? Subject + verb ....yes I See your last comment! Exactly good! where is the verb?\nstudent: account\nstudent: coal accounted for 50 percent of electricity\nteacher: yes that's it good well done - 'electricity' or 'electricity production' both possible actually so fine\nstudent: ok\nteacher: ok one more: try number 2...let me give you a little bot of help....so the first word is 'Coal' and the last 4  words are: ....producing 50% of its electricity'\nteacher: Can you the complete the middle?!\nteacher: ONLY with the other words in the document remember!\nstudent: coal was the main fuel, producing 50 percent of electricity.\nteacher: OK good - that's the right idea and a good example sentence! Can you see the words I've given you for number 5 in the document I emailed you?\nteacher: Sorry NUmber 2 I mean!\nstudent: yes, I can see it\nteacher: So e.g. 'Coal was the main______ of electricity in France, ' what;s the missing word?\nstudent: fuel\nteacher: From the document i sent you? IS the word 'fuel' in number 2?\nstudent: it is 'source'\nteacher: OK great thanks! But you idea was fine too by the way! ('fuel' I mean)....\nstudent: ok, thanks\nteacher: Want to try one final number Emily Johnson? How about number 3? go for it....\nteacher: First word remember is 'Fifty units...'\nstudent: Fifty units of electricity were produced by/from coal\nteacher: Yes well done that's great ( the passive!)\nstudent: thanks\nteacher: OK Emily Johnson so I'll email you the answers OK? And you can look at them later before or after trying to do them yourself first - your decision!\nstudent: yes, I will practice them after class.\nstudent: thanks\nteacher: OK fine ...so i'll see yo u in 15 minutes ok ...bye for now\nstudent: see you",
    "teacher: Hey sorry Emily had to go out for a minute!\nstudent: ok\nstudent: no problem\nteacher: So you got my email with the answers right? You don't need to look at them now - just checking\nstudent: yes, I am checking them\nteacher: OK so can I move to some speaking questions? The topic I have here is 'Work' - before we start perhaps I can ask you a couple of more simple/direct questions Emily....what do you want to do in the future (i mean as a job)?\nstudent: I want to become an investment banker\nteacher: Sorry internet down there for a second....ok yes I think I remember your banking ambitions now\nteacher: So can I ask you why you want to do this job? Your main reasons....?\nstudent: As a matter of fact, I really want to found my own hedge fund company in the future. so I asked to my bother who woks in a really well-know investment banking. And he told to me, If I want do something I want, I need to have some experience in investment banking firstly.\nteacher: OK I understand - so your brother already has  career in this area? That's great! So yes I guess if you wan t to set up your own company you need some experience first - that makes sense. Do you have any experience at all? What about your academic background? Remind me!\nteacher: sorry 'a career' = correct\nstudent: yes I did some internships and worked as a part-time assistant.\nteacher: Oh right OK so you have a rough idea - and what was your degree in?\nteacher: Economics?\nstudent: I studied economics in Japan and I will study it in the UK\nstudent: yes\nteacher: yes I remember now sorry - the master's!\nstudent: no, I will study my first degree in the UK\nstudent: I have just left the university in Japan to become a freshman in the UK\nstudent: because I really want to study for my master's at LSE, it would be really difficult for me if I graduated in Japan.\nteacher: When you say 'freshman' you mean in your first year right ?Sorry, it's an American phrase...what's the word for a second-year student?\nteacher: Difficult because they don't want to accept the degree from Japan you mean?\nstudent: I do not know the word for a second year student\nstudent: yes ,because the education system is different, it's not easy\nstudent: but if I graduate in the UK, it will be easier to apply to LSE\nteacher: Yes I understand ...I'd forgotten the word too but I've just checked and I remember now! 'sophmore'\nteacher: sorry: 'sophomore'\nstudent: ok\nteacher: OK thanks Emily hold on....\nteacher: So I think we need to think about verb tenses a little bit...I\nstudent: yes..because my sentences are not logical I suppose.\nteacher: So you were talking about the past and then about the future in your answers just now....and I could understand I suppose but I had to work it out for myself because your tenses were not reliable!\nteacher: So hold on....\nteacher: So when you talk about university in the uK it's your PLAN right?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: So do we use 'will'' for plans?!\nteacher: E.g. I will go to to London at the weekend' = correct?\nstudent: yes...I think it is correct\nteacher: OK so Emily - we use 'will' for: PRomises/offers/decision we make right now this second and ...predictions BUT NOT plans OK?\nstudent: ok\nstudent: because the plans are not the truth,  right?\nteacher: So if you ask me aobut my plans for the weekend you say: 'HI Ms. Sara Martinez, what __________ at the weekend?' Can you complete this question in a natural way?  You need 3 words and one of them is 'doing'\nstudent: what are you going to do at the weekend?\nteacher: OK thanks ...or 5 words and that's good!\nteacher: The other way is: 'What are you doing at the weekend'\nstudent: ok\nteacher: So when we talk about plans we can use the present continuous or 'going to' but NOT will - this is the same in the question and answer (about plans)\nteacher: When it is a general plan (maybe without exact dates times etc then we often use 'going to' just like you did in your question\nteacher: So Emily can you quickly tell me your plans again but this time with the correct structure?\nteacher: E.g. 'going to'!\nstudent: I am going to establish my own hedge fund\nteacher: OK nice example!\nstudent: OR I am going to find a job in investment banking.\nstudent: be going to do something, right?\nstudent: do\nteacher: Yes thanks Emily - what comes after 'going to'? the infinitive or the gerund?\nteacher: Yes that's it you've got it!\nstudent: infinitive\nstudent: thanks..\nteacher: so I;m going to find' right?\nteacher: and the place/company Emily is 'an investment BANK'\nteacher: the area/career/activity is 'investment banking'\nteacher: so you can say: a job in investment banking OR a job in AN investment BANK' do you see?\nstudent: so...I am going to find a job in an investment bank\nteacher: because 'bank' is countable e.g. 'a bank' BUT banking is uncountable\nstudent: yes,thanks\nteacher: ok good\nteacher: And one last test: what are your plans after this lesson?\nstudent: I am going to revise everything I learned in class\nteacher: OK good answer - what a good student1\nteacher: OK so remember: 'going to' + infinitive (VERB right?) - so where's your verb?\nstudent: the verb is after  the 'going to'\nstudent: I am going to review what I learned in this class.\nteacher: so is 'revision' a verb? Remember the ending -ion is common for nouns\nteacher: Ah yes better!\nteacher: so 'review' is possible or 'revise'\nstudent: thanks, I got it\nteacher: OK the site froze for me for a minute there but OK I'm back...\nteacher: I think for you too right?\nstudent: thanks I got it\nstudent: sorry I lost my internet just now\nteacher: Anyway - I guess we'll stop there for today BUT good work with 'going to' - if you get this right in your IELTS speaking/writing you'll get a better score OK?\nstudent: yes, thank a lot\nteacher: Yes that's ok - I think it was the site actually and not ouy\nteacher: not you\nstudent: see you tomorrow\nteacher: OK thanks then - I'll speak to you tomorrow bye\nstudent: bye",
    "teacher: Hi Emma Jones, oops I guess the site is supposed to refresh but it isn't doing that even though we've logged out - um ...I guess we'll just carry on if that's OK\nstudent: Hi Ms. Lopez\nteacher: Hello!\nstudent: How are you?\nteacher: Yeah not too bad thanks - just been reading the news ...things are stabilising perhaps for you guys too?\nstudent: Yes, they say so... Hopefully!!\nstudent: How about over there??\nteacher: Well..yes it feels quite controlled still to be honest....infections/deaths haven't risen quite as steeply as they feared...\nteacher: due to the lockdown basically i guess\nteacher: the only question id how long it goes on for ...and whether people will continue to abide by the rules...\nstudent: abide??\nstudent: tolerate!\nstudent: New word :)\nteacher: ah yes ..accept or act in accordance with (follow basically e.g. rule)\nteacher: e.g. law-abiding citizens = set phrase\nteacher: as opposed to criminals\nteacher: in the negative (strangely) it means hate/can't tolerate so e.g. I can't abide people who...blah blah (quite common actually)\nstudent: I see!! thanks\nstudent: ahh interesting the negative...\nteacher: check it out on bnc corpus you'll see the collocations!\nstudent: I will\nstudent: now or later??\nstudent: I'm checking now :)\nteacher: I was thinking of later I guess but whatever..I just have (!) and unsurprisingly: rules/code/decision = following noun again and again (you get the last one right?)\nteacher: OK!\nteacher: judgement court order etc etc (these all relate to'decision' of course - as in the decision of the court))\nstudent: Sorry I'm lost! from your 'I just have (!) and...\nteacher: guidelines...oh my god  it's addictive! (if you're a nerd like me...)\nstudent: hahah\nteacher: Sorry - I was looking at the corpus ...the word relate to the collocations it's giving for 'abide'\nstudent: I tried to find the word on BCN but it says that to continue I have to register... so I'll do it later\nteacher: Oh no! yes it's free - sometimes it asks me and other times it doesn't - i registered, forgot my login and now just reload the page and it usually seems to work but yeah try later....\nteacher: OK so Emma Jones, thinking about the questions from yesterday about different jobs....so you were talking about football players and you said they have a very good salary ...hold on a sec\nstudent: haha I don't know much about football but players from Barcelona club or Real Madrid earn far too much money\nteacher: and this is fine and correct obviously ....any other phrases for this idea e.g. (Footballers) have a very good salary ...ah yes! in other words they are 'overpaid' right?\nstudent: yes\nstudent: overpaid\nteacher: OK cool - any more phrases you can think of in general?\nstudent: Could you tell me another way of saying that they might be motivated to choose their profession by the high salary?\nstudent: motivated by something is correct??\nteacher: Yes OK sure...so 'motivated to' is a good idea...I was going to suggest a couple of phrases for this...yes: motivated to (do something) and 'motivated by (+noun) = good hold on\nteacher: another good word here might be 'driven' OK?\nteacher: same structures - a bit stronger maybe but common\nteacher: so non-natives say 'salary, salary salary' and it's fine BUT of course we often use other words like...hold on sec ....\nstudent: I think if you are very good at playing football it must be fantastic to have the opportunity to turn your hobby into your profession (I know it's not correct but I'd like to know how to express this idea)\nstudent: I'm going to read now what you just wrote\nteacher: no it's not wrong but maybe 'turn your hobby into  your profession' is more normal\nteacher: well not maybe definitely!\nteacher: NOt make 'into' by the way just 'make'\nteacher: make something something else!'\nteacher: so the common everyday words are 'money' (of course) but also 'pay' - this is the one that non-natives never say\nstudent: I see, thank you!\nteacher: as  a noun I mean\nteacher: so e.g. 'What's the pay like?' is very common\nstudent: So, I could say 'footballers are motivated by their pay'?\nteacher: yes you can - the only thing is that specifically for football players we often say 'wages' -this is just arbitrary I'm afraid! You know the normal difference between wages and salary right?\nstudent: I've never used this word as a noun\nteacher: no i can imagine - it;s a common gap!\nstudent: I'll use it from now on\nteacher: ok!\nteacher: So by the way 'wage' is more generally associated with 'blue collar' jobs (a bit outdated this phrase but still useful here) and 'salary' more for 'white-colalr jobs'\nteacher: sorry 'collar'\nstudent: No idea about blue or white collar\nteacher: salary' agreed in advance and often monthly blah blah - wages maybe hourly for example another possible difference\nteacher: oh sorry ...which colour is e.g. unskilled manual work do you think?\nstudent: I don't have a clue, sorry\nteacher: that's ok...so traditionally 'white collar' = suit and tie working at a desk and 'blue collar' = physical work basically\nstudent: by the way, could you tell me the meaning of e.g and other abbreviations you use sometimes?\nstudent: Now I see!! very original\nteacher: yes sure -sorry internet went haywire there for a  minute\nteacher: um...yes e.g. just means 'for example' (from Latin 'exempli gratia) but very common\nteacher: if you say it you say the names of the letters 'ee jee'\nteacher: and yes you can say it too weirdly!\nteacher: not everyone!\nteacher: on;y highly intelligent educated folks like me\nstudent: I imagined it was that but sometimes you use other letters, don't you?\nteacher: any others - remind me (abbreviations I mean)\nteacher: um...maybe i.e.?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: it means in other words or that is (or less formally but common 'as in' ) from Latin 'id est' (but hardly anyone knows that of course)\nteacher: again you can say it (just say the letters indivaidually)\nstudent: Ok, thank you!!\nteacher: I can't think of any more I use in this format...\nstudent: No, I think that's all. I don't even want to use them, I just want to understand you ;)\nteacher: but those are common in writing (and speaking to some extent) - I guess this chat format is another example of the explosion in writing - just not as we know it i.e. (!) writing like speaking ( for texts/internet etc)\nteacher: Oh hold on - 'etc' - this is the same in Spanish right?!\nstudent: yes!! etc\nstudent: but I don't think we have i.e.\nteacher: ok right\nstudent: p.e. is your e.g.\nstudent: your\nstudent: Por ejemplo\nteacher: ah yes I see - i have a feeling less common though in use ...\nstudent: yes, it is less common, I think we use it for short messages or when we take notes..\nteacher: Hey Emma Jones I watched a bit of Masterchef Junior (Spanish version) last night with my daughter and was reminded of how common 'o sea' is!\nteacher: Just because one kid was saying it literally every other word\nstudent: haha yes, I don't use it but it is very common\nteacher: and my daughter commented on it\nstudent: really?? it's very good that your daughter is picking it up!\nstudent: does she speak Spanish??\nteacher: I guess it's similar to English 'like' - I mean in frequency use if not always exactly in meaning\nstudent: Yes, there is a new one in Spanish, let me think... I can't remember\nteacher: Yes ..well not exactly fluently...but she can understand a lot and has native pronunciation of course cos she learned it so young\nteacher: She goes to Spanish  'Saturday school'  - the other kids all have Spanish=speaking parents - we just got her to go cos my partner helped set it up (she's an expert in that kind of thing)\nstudent: That's great\nteacher: Yes it's nice - but it's annoying when she corrects/laughs at my pronunciation if i say a word!\nstudent: I love these clubs from England!! we talked about all these things to do a few weeks ago...\nteacher: Ha - here's something funny Emma Jones - I got my revenge over my daughter when she couldn't understand a boy last night because he was from Andalucia!\nteacher: Tengo die anos etc (she's like - HOW old ishe!)\nstudent: haha I can imagine! it's not nice when someones corrects you all the time\nteacher: no...\nstudent: ufff Andalucian accent is hard to understand!\nteacher: yes , you know when I first when to live in Spain (with basically zero Spanish) I went to Cadiz\nstudent: haha poor you\nteacher: I always equate it to a foreigner going to Glasgow to learn English\nteacher: I didn't really appreciate how weird it was until later - i was trying to survive and thought it was (kinda) normal\nstudent: I've never been to Glasgow but I won't go to take a course\nteacher: no!\nteacher: HA that's funny - I guess they have schools there I;m not sure...!\nteacher: Now I only speak to South Americans really so I really see the difference\nstudent: Ohh I'm back\nteacher: you ok?\nstudent: I lost the connection with the server\nteacher: sure\nteacher: sorry did you mean before Emma Jones that we have lots of clubs in the UK (compared to Spain)?\nstudent: Yes, South American accent is very different, I really like it! I love their words, the ones that are different from ours\nstudent: Answering your question about clubs, yes, you have a lot of clubs and schools or groups to practise languages, sports, etc.\nteacher: yes - i;m not really sure about the accent from where you are to be honest (is it 'sing-sing'? !)  sorry I think [Iveheard that!\nteacher: yes - I think we like these kind of organised activity to help regulate our socail interaction you know?\nstudent: what have you heard? sing-sing??\nteacher: sorry! 'sing-song'\nteacher: with a rising and falling rhythm - i;m digging myself a hole here!\nstudent: I think I know what you mean but is that a word to define an accent or you just made it up??\nteacher: no I didn;t make it up!\nstudent: It is said that our accent is much softer than the accent form the mainland\nteacher: yes I see - maybe a bit more like SOuth AMerica?\nstudent: Similar to the Venezuelan accent or Chilean\nteacher: right OK - I think i had that idea phew! OK so i'll come back to those CAE questions tomorrow ok!\nstudent: yes, when I travel to the mainland, people there ask me very often if I am from Venezuela\nstudent: Sorry!!\nteacher: oh right interesting\nteacher: OK Emma Jones speak tomorrow!\nstudent: Yes, we'll continue tomorrow\nteacher: OK cheers bye\nstudent: Thank you very much! bye",

Use the keywords and say it correctly if you  can\nstudent: ok, in good English I suppose -  I am going home by train and leaving at 9:30.\nteacher: OK thanks Sophia Liu - that's good yes...present continous to talk about your personal plans (especially when you have exact times etc) hold on...\nteacher: So you can say: ' I'm going home tomorrow ...' and the second half you wrote was possible/good...this way is also possible: ' My train ________ at 9:30' what's the missing word/words?\nstudent: my train leaves at 9:30\nstudent: or - my train's leaving time is 9:30.\nteacher: OK thanks...so you can describe your own plans with present continuous or 'going to' ...when we talk about courses/trains etc (things with timetables) we often use present simple...\nteacher: So: 'I'm going home tomorrow - my train _____ at 9:30' One word...what is it?\nstudent: my train leaves at 9:30.\nteacher: yes that's it  - that's a common way of saying it\nteacher: So, one more: 'I __________ my course at the end of this week.' OR 'My course__________ at the end of this week.' Use the verb finish for both - but you might need a different tense!\nstudent: ok - so just use present simple to describe the future in this sentence, right?\nteacher: Yes that's right!\nstudent: I finish my course at the end of this week. - or My course finishes at the end of this week.\nteacher: Yes good - remember for the present continuous you need the structure 'be + _______ing' can you do that second one again?\nstudent: My course is finishing at the end of this week.\nteacher: THat's it great\nstudent: thanks - I realised my mistakes in English grammar.\nteacher: I should say Sophia Liu at this point that I;m afraid these verb forms for the future are not always used consistently (you know what I mean? As in predictably or always in the same way) so you might see/hear English speakers mixing them up sometimes BUT I wanted to give you some general feedback\nteacher: In IELTS speaking parts 1 and 2 they might ask you about your plans so present contiuous/going to would l be useful in these parts of the test\nstudent: ok, that is great - I will focus on this\nteacher: OK good .....But it's true that the questions tend to be more about the past .....let's think about that now OK?\nteacher: Especially for speaking PArt 2\nstudent: because in Chinese we do not have tenses, so I always forget them when I am writing and speaking.\nteacher: So look at these points for Part 2 speaking: Describe a journey that didn't go as planned. You should say: (hold on!)\nstudent: yes , I am lacking part 2\nteacher: 1. Where you were going 2. How you were travelling 3.Who you were with 4.What went wrong 5. Explain what you would do differently\nteacher: have a think for a minute about a possible journey you could talk about and then start with Question 1 OK?\nstudent: ok\nteacher: It would be good if you had at least a couple of sentences for each part of the answer\nteacher: Sorry I've just see your comment above: 'cause in Chinese we do not have tenses, so I always forget them when I am writing and speaking.' ...Yes I understand!\nstudent: 1. I am going to describe a trip to London, which is the most popular city in the UK.\nteacher: OK thanks fine ..keep going...\nstudent: 2. I was very happy with the whole trip, even though we did not follow the plan that we had written before. Because we took the wrong train in the morning, we had to change the plan.\nteacher: OK understood ....continue...\nstudent: 3. And my classmates travelled together with me. As a matter of fact, there was my new friend who I had met in my class. You know, he is a Japanese, so it's quite easy to communite with him, because I can speak Japanese.\nteacher: ok great - got it ...keep going...\nstudent: 4. As I said before, the first thing that went wrong was the train that we took, which was slow. It was the first time we had travelled by train in the UK. And then, we had to cancel our plans. We made a lot of mistakes when we visited London. For example, took a wrong underground due to the fact that we did no have the Internet underground.\nteacher: OK! I get it ...and finally number 5....\nstudent: 5. Actually, I am a person who always relies on plans, so it was a very different trip for me. However, we went sightseeing somewhere I never planned. For example, the National Gallery, where there are a lot of paintings whose meaning I could not understand. It was also an interesting trip I believed and I suppose I am willing to attempt a new trip without a plan in the future.\nteacher: OK thanks Sophia Liu - i've copied all that - give me a second - i'll tell you some good stuff!\nstudent: ok, thanks a lot - when I was answering these questions, I felt I was writing in English, so I was focusing on tenses and sentences. But when I am speaking, I always forget about them...\nteacher: Yes I understand! Well anyway here's a few good things in your answer the whole trip / even through / we had to / as (a!) matter of fact / As I said before / Actually / rely on /for example, the National Gallery / I  am willing to attempt\nteacher: Some topic words and some nice general phrases\nteacher: I;ll go over some other things to think about when we come back after the break....\nstudent: ok, thanks- see you\nteacher: Ah yes ok  i;ve just noticed: ' even though ' is correct ( notthrough!)\nteacher: not even thRough!\nteacher: ok bye for now\nstudent: ok, I will modify it\nstudent: bye",
    "teacher: Hi Megan - can I just ask you ...did you log out of the site at the beginning of our break (more than 10 minutes ago)?\nstudent: yes..\nteacher: OK no problem - I think they are trying to fix the site so that the previous lesson disappears....\nstudent: my internet was lost, so I needed to reconnect\nteacher: You\u2019ve got 5 uses of the past simple which is basically very good (I mean you\u2019ve remembered!) BUT one of them is not quite right \u2013 I mean the idea of the past simple is correct but you haven\u2019t used it correctly\u2026.Which one?? Which verb I mean..so e.g. the first one \u2018was\u2019 is OK\u2026) Here is your answer: I was very happy of the whole trip, even through we were not obey the plan that we wrote before. because we took the wrong train in the morning, we had to change the plan.\nteacher: OK!\nstudent: no, I can see the records of the last class in this chat box (before the break)\nteacher: Yes me too - that's OK don't worry about it - try my question on the your past tenses ok?\nstudent: ok - I am very happy with the whole trip ( because the feeling is happening now ) - we did not follow the plan that we had written before.\nstudent: because the action of writing the plan happened before not following the plan, right?\nteacher: OK thanks Megan - well not impossible I guess your first idea (I am happy) BUT I was happy was good! What about 'we were not obey'?? What's the main verb here?\nstudent: ok - so the main verb was obey\nteacher: Yes that's right...so what's 'were' doing there??\nteacher: Do you need it?\nstudent: no..- so the answer is we did not follow the plan - or we deviated from the plan.\nstudent: is it the right answer?\nteacher: Yes that's right...'We didn't follow the plan' = good (the normal verb is 'follow' but don't worry about that too much now! the important thing is negative past simple you normally need 'didn't' right?\nteacher: Good\nstudent: yes, I got it\nteacher: So e.g. 'I_____ happy with my exam result even though I _________ get 100%'\nstudent: I was happy with my exam results even though I didn't get 100 percent.\nteacher: OK great\nteacher: Ok Megan , one more example from your answer....can you see whwere you forgot to use the past here? : And my classmates with me traveled together, as matter of fact, we were just a new friend who I meet in my class\nstudent: who I met in my class\nteacher: yes good!\nstudent: thanks\nteacher: OK Megan last example for the past simple...where is he verb in the following?? for example, the National Gallery where with many painting that I could not understand the meaning\nteacher: Sorry hold on..just this bit: or example, the National Gallery where with many painting\nteacher: Do you need a verb here somewhere??\nstudent: the National Gallery where there were many painting, right?\nteacher: OK thanks hold on - this is a useful question\nteacher: So if you talk about LOndon for example you can say: 'London has many museums.' Right?\nstudent: I think paintings are always there, so is it correct to use present simple?\nteacher: Yes present simple fine yes but look: OR you can say: ' _______  _______ many museums in London.'?\nteacher: ______ are ______ many museums in London - does that help?\nteacher: Sorry: '________  are many museums'\nteacher: just one word!\nteacher: You OK?! Bad internet connection?\nstudent: yes, I am back\nstudent: let me try\nteacher: ok!\nstudent: There are many museums in London. -\nteacher: OK cool hold on\nstudent: ok\nteacher: SO....you said: 'the National Gallery where have many painting.right?' You can say: The National Gallery, which ________ many paintings' OR 'The National Gallery where _____ are many paintings'\nstudent: The National Gallery, where there are many paintings - OR The National Gallery where there are many paintings.\nteacher: OK thanks Megan - second one = correct good. First one? remember the example before? 'London has many museums' so : The National Gallery, which ____ many paintings...'?\nstudent: The National Gallery, which has many paintings\nteacher: Yes good ('has' because it's singular but yes right verb!)\nstudent: yes! my mind is thinking slowly....\nteacher: Of course Megan you could also say 'there were lots of paintings' too\nstudent: ok, I'll write all of them down on my notebook.\nstudent: thanks\nteacher: It;s true that they are still there now so present simple OK BUT especailly because you weren't just saying that but you wree saying that you couldn't understand them so this is more specific and means the past simple would be better really by the way....\nteacher: sorry for my typing! 'especially' and 'were' is what I wanted to write!\nstudent: ok...it is true that it's difficult for me to understand but I will do my best to study them.\nteacher: Sorry ..it is ___ for me to understand?\nstudent: it is true that it is difficult for me to understand them, but I will do my best.\nteacher: truth' ?!\nstudent: fact\nstudent: fact\uff1f\nstudent: oh..it is my mistakes..\nteacher: Um..sorry not sure to be honest!\nteacher: use google translate if you like!\nteacher: I feel like I want to understand your point here!\nstudent: It is true that it is difficult for me to understand these points\nteacher: Ah OK ! Thanks - I could have worked it out I guess!\nstudent: I can't understand what I wrote before either...sorry\nteacher: yes I can see that these structures (there are/were, which has etc) are quite basic in a way in Egnlish but I can see they are very confusing if your first language is very different!\nteacher: OK Megan let me suggest you do some online exercises on past simple Megan - just to get those past simple forms in your head so you remember to use them and don't use the present tense when you need the past OK?\nstudent: yes..if I can use it correctly in my writing, I suppose I can get a high score in IELTS.\nstudent: ok\nteacher: Also, you could do some online stuff on the will v going to OK?\nstudent: ok , thanks\nteacher: E.g. 'Oh those bags look heavy. 'Don't worry, I ______ help you carry them.' Will or going to?!\nstudent: will\nteacher: OK good - will for an offer right?!\nstudent: yes\nteacher: OK one more: 'look at those black clouds..I think it ________ rain'\nstudent: is going to\nteacher: OK good = prediction BUT with evidence now (you see?)\nstudent: yes, I see it\nteacher: OK one more: If a child spends many hours a day practising the piano then it is possible he or she _____ become a great pianist'\nstudent: will\nteacher: ok good - for first conditional we usually use 'will'\nstudent: ok, thanks\nteacher: One final one: 'In my view, scientists _________ discover a cure for most diseases .'\nstudent: are going to\nteacher: Ok thanks - 'will' is also possible here - which one is best if you are making a general prediction (at some time in the future)\nteacher: the other word would be if you think the cure is coming soon/you are thinking of specific progress right now\nstudent: ok, I understand it\nteacher: OK so the more evidence you have (like the black clouds remember?!) the more we say 'going to' and the more general we say 'will'\nteacher: Usually!\nteacher: OK thanks Megan well done good work on tenses today  - bye for now - speak to you tomorrow....\nstudent: ok\nstudent: bye, see you tomorrow\nteacher: cheers\nstudent: cheers",
    "teacher: Hi Sophia Smith, getting on OK?\nstudent: Hy Mrs. Rodriguez! yes, it seems I'm getting used to it... How about you?\nteacher: Yes I'm OK too thanks. I'm a bit of an introvert/self-contained kind of person to be honest so actually I'm fine!\nstudent: Good news :)\nteacher: yes although I normally do a lot of exercise and that's tricky (i;ve hurt my leg so I can;t do my normal 50 miles a week - can't blame coronavirus for that though...)\nteacher: I'm going mad and just trying not to eat too much...\nteacher: cos normally I eat like 3,000 calories a day or whatever you know\nstudent: Ohh sorry to hear that... is it serious? your injury\nstudent: Yes, now we all have to eat less, I'm trying... not easy having food so available all the time\nteacher: Oh well I don't think so - I;ve had a couple of knee operations before so I;m kind of used to it psychologically - I'll never be an olympic athlete but i'm too competitive! Yes the food the food always there.....aahhh\nstudent: Well, I hope you get better very soon\nstudent: Could you go out for a run in the UK at the moment??\nteacher: Actually I went to the supermarket for the first time yesterday since the start of the new restrictions and it was a surreal experience  - yes you  are allowed to exercise still (limited time intheory and maintaining a distance!\nteacher: It's actually busier than normal where I live because I live in the countryside\nteacher: Normally it;s basically dead but lots of walkers at the moment (how i hate them)\nstudent: I see, here it was the same at the beginning... Supermarkets full of people, perfect situation to spread the virus... Now it's better\nstudent: haha you hate them??\nstudent: I hate dog owners... they are allowed to go out 3 times a day :(\nteacher: Right...well they've got a limiit on the number of people in a shop at any one time you know and everyone does their best to avoid each other (and queues outside at a distance - it's kind of funny...and not of course...)\nteacher: 3 times a day - yes I see that does seem unfair\nteacher: Well 'hate' is a bit strong but basically I like it being empty and quiet you know? So i;m just being grumpy / anti-social!\nstudent: Yes, I understand!!\nteacher: And it's because sometimes they trespass on the land where I live which is annoying\nstudent: trespass?? Do they get into your place?? Not sure about the meaning...\nstudent: Yes, I just checked\nteacher: sorry yes - trespass usually refers to land rather than buildings and it just means go on private land without permission\nteacher: right!\nteacher: Common sign = No Trespassing\nteacher: or: 'Trespassers will be prosecuted'\nstudent: Not very nice of the new countryside walkers...\nteacher: No! The thing is it's not my land but the landowner kind of wants me to do my bit in terms of telling people ....\nteacher: So i feel obliged to tell them if i see them ...but sometimes they get a bit funny\nstudent: These days you become a police officer around your land\nteacher: yes...I have to stay calm....otherwise you go mad\nstudent: haha\nstudent: It's much easier to go mad with all the restrictions...\nteacher: yes.... was thinking about where you are Sophia Smith and food....\nteacher: Do you have to import a lot of stuff normally?\nstudent: I guess so, but I'm not sure to be honest... I know we produce a lot of things on the islands but I guess we do\nteacher: right - but no problems with food supply at the moment?\nstudent: not so far... sometimes when we go to the supermarket there are some products missing but I'm not sure if it is about supply issues or just that people are going crazy these days buying too much of everything\nstudent: How do you say 'supply issues'?\nteacher: I see yes - because that was something that happened as from 2 weeks or so ago here - everyone started stockpiling/panic buying and the shelves were base (of a lot of stuff like tinned stuff/packets of dried food like pasta , pulses etc) whcih was alarming -\nteacher: No 'supply issues' was good!\nteacher: shelves were 'bare' I meant\nstudent: I like 'panic buying', it describes very well what is actually happening\nteacher: yes a neat Anglo-Saxon construction!\nteacher: OK Sophia Smith member 'salary/pay/wages' etc\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: so a couple of other phrases/words that occurred to me the other day were e..g make a fortune/lucrative\nteacher: familiar right?\nteacher: I was thinking about footballers for the first one - of course you can replace 'fortune' with other words like in a lot of these types of phrases e.g a ton / a packet etc\nstudent: Yes, I know 'make a fortune' but I don't quite know how to use 'lucrative'\nstudent: to describe an activity or a business\nteacher: so 'lucrative' can be for either\nstudent: Yes, I like it. I could say that footballers make a fortune just by having fun playing with a ball ;)\nteacher: and jobs in general\nteacher: yes absolutely\nstudent: yes\nstudent: but what about lucrative, how do you use it for footballers??\nteacher: rake it in' just occurred to me as another informal possilibity - do you know this tool (a rake? ) - sure well you could say e.g. 'for some football can be  a lucrative carrer'\nteacher: in fact the more I think about it the more I realize how common/normal  'rake it in' is...\nstudent: No, I don't know 'rake it in'. It's the first time I see it... I think\nstudent: accumulate says my dictionary\nteacher: the first time I'VE seen it' - well a rake is for gardening - a pole with metal end with kind of metal spikes that you use to sweep up  e.g. leaves/weeds etc (but not like a brush so you don't normally say 'sweep  - we say 'rake'!) - yes accumulate correct but rubbish!\nstudent: is that the meaning you are refering to??\nstudent: Oh thank you, (I've seen it)\nteacher: It's difficult to describe a rake! yes that's the meaning i.e. it's like you're sweeping up money\nteacher: BUt you can't say that!\nteacher: UNless it was real money on the floor!\nstudent: I see!!\nteacher: OK...Can I ask you now the second question for the CAE part 3 about he jobs which was....who should get paid the most (remember the jobs?)\nteacher: judge/footballer/politician/teacher/ and one more....?\nteacher: surgeon ! right?\nstudent: I'll try to answer that very difficult question\nteacher: ok!\nteacher: Just make it up - I won't quote you on it...\nstudent: I think that surgeons should be the best paid considering that they save lives\nteacher: understood.....\nstudent: I strongly disagree with the fortunes that footballers make\nteacher: ok....\nstudent: Is it correct?\nteacher: Yes its\nteacher: it is\nstudent: can you disagree with pay or maybe you use another better verb?\nteacher: You can disagree with the money they make - it's OK\nteacher: pay without article\nteacher: I disagree with their pay\nteacher: with how much they make/get etc\nteacher: Of course lots of other possiblities e.g. I think the amount of money they get is outrageous etc etc\nstudent: If politicians are serious, reliable and responsible, they should also get a good pay because they have a very important job, they make very crucial decisions\nstudent: decisions\nstudent: especially these days we can see how important doctors and politicians are\nteacher: Yes understood - they should get paid well (maybe with 'get' we normally say 'paid'. As a noun (no article remember) we often say e.g. THeir pay is justified... or e.g. What's the pay like? Yeah the pay's OK' etc\nstudent: Do you have a word that includes doctors, nurses, and the rest of people who look after our health? we call them 'sanitarios'\nteacher: Well healthcare workers is OK ...or of course we often  say people who work for the NHS\nteacher: or NHS staff\nstudent: I see! thanks\nstudent: Sorry but I'm not sure about the word 'pay'\nteacher: This is a huge thing right now of course - everyone is worshipping our national health service\nstudent: Is 'have a good pay' not correct?\nteacher: No it's OK  I can see it;s weird ...hold on a sec\nteacher: So number 1: as a noun 'pay' is uncountable so no 'a' OK?\nstudent: Yes, this is what I mean, I don't want to say weird things ;)\nteacher: ha well it's not weird for me ...hold on....\nteacher: and it doesn't really collocate with 'have' or 'get'\nteacher: well not 'have' - 'get' is more possible but...\nteacher: we often say e.g. 'THe pay is really good' or What's the pay like? you see\nteacher: or after a pronoun e.g. my/you pay etc\nteacher: your pay i mean\nteacher: So e.g. there's a problem with my pay - i need to talk to the finance department at work (ok?)\nstudent: I understand now. Thank you!\nteacher: Sorry one more I;ve realised is really common\nstudent: ok\nteacher: e.g. Doctors' pay is set to rise by more than 5%...\nteacher: Very common in the media\nteacher: Maybe because it's short!\nstudent: Does 'set to rise' mean that it is about to increase??\nstudent: to be increased?\nteacher: Yes that's it ..'to be set to' means 'going to' basically\nstudent: Ahh ok\nstudent: ok\nteacher: set to = a little bit formal by the way but really  really common in the media\nteacher: less in everyday conversation\nteacher: and you don't say e.g. I'm set to get fit!\nteacher: i.e. not for an intention/prediction\nstudent: I'm setting off for the park?? I guess it's not correct but in case\nteacher: no!\nstudent: Ok, you just answered my question\nteacher: but it's confusing as lots of other phrasal verbs with set\nstudent: you've just answered my question! sorry\nteacher: e.g. I set off for the park at 10\nstudent: I don't really know the meaning of these phrasal verbs, (I was about to ask you for some examples)\nstudent: Set off = start going to the park??\nteacher: OK right! Yes I'll include some next time! Also tomorrow Sophia Smith if possible  - I'll review these speaking questions and try to focus on comparative structures !\nteacher: yes set off just means 'leave'\nteacher: and common!\nteacher: set off for a destination\nstudent: something with \\set the alarm clock\\\"??\"\nteacher: not just leave as in get out!\nteacher: Ah that's just 'set' as in I set the alarm for 5 ....but there are other ones! tomorrow tomorrow OK?\nstudent: Yes, more tomorrow!\nstudent: Thank you very much!!\nteacher: OK fine - bye for now.....\nstudent: Bye bye",
    "student: Good afternoon Mrs. Patel.\nteacher: Hi Emily Smith how are you?\nteacher: I'm fine thanks yeah - trying to keep fit!\nstudent: yes, I am fine\nstudent: and you?\nteacher: good...are you still doing much indoor physical activity?!\nstudent: yeah, I am still doing some indoor exercises\nteacher: OK...'I am insist'? ..you mean like 'continue'?\nstudent: yes, I continue doing some indoor exercises.\nteacher: Ah right OK...'still' is best here (most common) so 'I'm still _______ some indoor exercise.'\nstudent: I am still doing some indoor exercises.\nteacher: yes OK - OR: 'I'm continuing to do indoor...' OR I'm continuing with indoor ...' (both in present continuous OK?)\nteacher: Because it's at the moment not as a normal/regular thing\nteacher: One final question on this Emily Smith: exercise or exercises? do you know the difference?!\nteacher: All right Emily Smith?\nstudent: I think exercise is plural\nstudent: exercises\nteacher: Well yes...they are both possible but they mean slightly different things! Which one means physical activity in general?\nteacher: So e.g. It's good to try to do regular __________?\nstudent: I think 'exercise' means physical activity\nteacher: OR 'Regular _________ is part of a healthy lifestyle' (there's a clue there with the verb after the gap!)\nstudent: it is good to try to do regular exercise\nteacher: Yes both exercise and exercises means phyiscal activity (ah I see what you mean yes - exercises can be for school or whatever yes)\nstudent: okay, I understand .\nteacher: So in the singular (exercise) means in general  yes good - and exercises then? (when you're talking about physical activity?)\nteacher: So in other words what is 'an exercise'??\nstudent: an exercise means one exercise I guess\nteacher: OK yes! Like e.g. a press up or something right? So if someone says ' I do exercises.'  they are talking abou t the group of different specific exercises they do you see? (like press ups, stretches and so on)\nteacher: So for IELTS 'exercise' is usually what you need to say because you will probably talk about exercise in general!\nstudent: wow..like character and characteristics\nteacher: yes I guess you're right actually - that's a good comparison\nstudent: thanks, I think I can understand now.\nteacher: OK good - Emily Smith, if you check your email hopefully you'll find an attachment with a TAsk 1 writing task in it!\nstudent: yes, I have received it\nteacher: OK great - if you open it you'll see it;s about sports/physical activities....Can I ask you to write ONE sentence for me to explain  the following data point please? Hold on...\nteacher: By the way you haven't seen this table before have you?\nstudent: in fact I saw it in the class that you taught\nteacher: Oh OK sorry - yes I suddenly thought that we did it before! OK, no problem we'll leave that then and do something different!\nstudent: ok~\nteacher: OK Emily Smith, before we start a big topic I just want to use this example sentence you just wrote to do another thing on tenses oK? in fact I have seen it in class when you teach us.\nteacher: So TWO tenses in here right? 'in fact I have seen it in class when you teach us.'\nteacher: What are the names of the tenses you used?\nstudent: yes\nstudent: past perfect?\nstudent: or present perfect\nteacher: So past perfect = 'had + past participle' ..this is..Yes! present perfect\nteacher: and the other one?\nstudent: present simple\nstudent: I guess...\nteacher: oK yes correct so hold on\nteacher: When do we use the present perfect? A big question i know - if you're not sure just tell me quickly!\nstudent: something has happened\nteacher: Um yes OK ...when?\nteacher: IN the past or in the present?!\nteacher: A stupid question I know - I;m just doing it step by step\nteacher: In the past right?\nstudent: something has happened\nstudent: I don't know why today the internet is so crazy.\nteacher: Yes it's annoying isn't it? Everyone's having problems -  think maybe because there are more people using it than normal?\nstudent: yes..maybe this is the reason\nteacher: OK so Emily Smith - if we know exactly when something happened do we use the present perfect e.g. 'Yesterday I have watched a film.' Correct?\nstudent: no...I think just the past tense is ok\nteacher: OK good - so if we have a specific past time then we need the past simple....So for example: ' Last year I ________ to France.'\nstudent: Last year I went to France\nstudent: went to\nteacher: OK thanks correct! BUT ...if we don't know or care about exactly when it's different in English. So that's why if I ask you the general (without a specific time)  question I ask: '_______ you ever _____ to France?' ?\nstudent: Have you ever been to France?\nteacher: oK good (Have you ever been to France...'gone' means you're still there now but don't worry about that now!)\nstudent: ok, thanks\nteacher: And the answer for example = 'Yes I _____________ there twice'\nstudent: Yes I have been there twice.\nteacher: OK great, correct! Did i say exactly when?\nstudent: NO, this action just happened and we don't know the time.\nteacher: OK good - so ...'I ___________ there when I was a student.' ??\nstudent: I was there when I was a student\nteacher: Did I say when?\nstudent: because the period of being a student is not specific time\nstudent: just in my opinion\nteacher: Ah i understand your idea BUT it's enough in English to change it!!\nteacher: Because if you say when I WAS a student it's definitely in the past and you're not a student now do you see?\nteacher: So we need to say: 'I _________ there when I was a student.' ??\nstudent: yes I see it\nstudent: I went there when I was a student\nteacher: OK good - this is the only correct answer OK? This is important!\nstudent: yes , I think I understand it clearly now.\nteacher: OK so going back to the original sentence....can you make it correct??  Look: 'in fact I have seen it in class when you teach us.'\nstudent: In fact, I saw it in class when you taught us\nteacher: Yes that's it great for the first one - this is a specific day when you saw it right?\nteacher: So....we need to think about the second one now!! Hold on.....\nstudent: yes, because I remember that day and just only one day, it is specific.\nteacher: Yes OK so it must be a particular day (because every day in the past is a specific day! it doesn't matter if you remember it or not)\nstudent: ok, I got it, thanks\nteacher: So Emily Smith I'll ask you about the second half of yours sentence after the break - but your sentence earlier was a really useful example!  IF you get these tenses right you'll make a big step in improving your score  in speaking and writing\nteacher: Did you manage to do any exercises online?\nstudent: ok, I realise it now, thanks\nstudent: see you\nteacher: OK see you after the break...\nteacher: Remember to log out if you can",
    "teacher: Hi there...\nstudent: hey, I am here\nteacher: OK so,  let's have a think about this again Natalie OK? Don't answer yet but here is what we're going to do:  'I saw this when you_______(teach) us.'\nteacher: So Natalie....what action happened first? you seeing the table or me teaching you?\nstudent: me seeing the table happened first\nteacher: Are you sure? Was i your teacher before that?!\nstudent: wow..you were teaching us first and then gave us the table chart\nteacher: OK good! And was I also your teacher After you saw the table?\nstudent: yes, you were also my teacher.\nteacher: OK fine! So we have two actions right? ONE of them ('seeing the table' ) happened 'inside' the other - the second one existed (me teaching you) existed before, during AND after the other\nteacher: So do we use the past simple for BOTH actions?\nstudent: no, I think one of them should be past perfect\nteacher: Ah ok I see your idea...well past perfect is some that happened BEFORE something else -BUT this is different because the other thing happened before, DURING and AFTER OK?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: OK Natalie so imagine: I look out of my window and I see a man i have never seen before OK? Maybe I ask myself: At the moment...what ________(do)?\nteacher: Choose a tense Natalie to complete the question!\nstudent: what are you doing?\nstudent: what should I do?\nteacher: OK yes good exactly: 'what's he doing? ' and the answer maybe is: 'Nothing special ...He ___ just ____ (walk) along the street'\nstudent: He is just walking along the street.\nteacher: OK good thanks hold on\nteacher: So two action right? Which one started first? (the seeing or the walking?)\nstudent: walking is the first action\nteacher: OK good fine so...we have two tenses: the present simple and the present continuous OK?\nstudent: While he was walking, I saw him. After I saw him, he was still walking along the street.\nteacher: yes exactly good! So the seeing is 'inside' the walking!\nstudent: yes,ok\nteacher: SO...your original sentence was : 'I saw this when you_______(teach) us.'\nteacher: THis is in the past it's true but the logic is the same...\nstudent: so...I saw the table when you were teaching us. Because you were my teacher before, you gave me the table\nteacher: So the first verb is in the past simple good ...and the second needs to be the....??\nteacher: Yes yes that's it!\nstudent: wow..I got it\nstudent: I never understood it before you taught me this stuff.\nteacher: Yes that's ok ...So you need the PAST CONTINUOUS - how do we make it? We need to two parts remember? the PRESENT continuous = is/are + ____ing and the PAST continuous?\nstudent: was/were + __ing\nteacher: OK great so...'I__________ it when you ____  ______ us.'??\nstudent: I saw it when you were teaching us.\nteacher: OK fantastic - you've got it\nstudent: yes!! thanks\nteacher: So Natalie let's just use this a bit before you forget it! Hold on....\nstudent: ok\nteacher: So I can say about myself for example: 1. I saw the first Lord of the Rings film when I was living in Spain. 2. yesterday I was driving to the supermarket when I saw a police car stop someone in their car. 3. I was going to school when I realized my phone was at home. etc etc ...Can you think of a couple of examples (true if possible - but they don't have to be interesting!) for yourself?)\nstudent: I  understood the present continuous when I was studying online.\nstudent: I understood present continuous when I was studying online.\nteacher: OK thanks - the second one = correct good\nteacher: Try one more if you can OK?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: ok...\nstudent: I was studying in Cambridge when I went to London with my friends.\nteacher: OK cool - you've got it I think...\nstudent: yes, I always need to think which action was long and which happened inside it\nteacher: yes OK i see - it'll get more automatic over time if you keep practising...\nteacher: Natalie - let me give you a couple of examples about how you can use the present perfect or present continuous in IELTS essays OK? Hold on a sec....\nstudent: ok, I will practise this sentence after class.\nteacher: OK good\nstudent: ok\nteacher: By the way ..you vcan save them and copy and paste your examples in our lesson tomorrow if you like ok?\nstudent: yes, I'd like to\nteacher: Hi sorry - internet went out there for a minute\nteacher: OK Natalie so let me give you a few typical sentences for essay introductions and we can think about the use of the present perfect/present continuous....hold on\nteacher: Remember the problem and solution essay we did in class about the lack of teachers?\nstudent: yes , it always happens...at first I was unhappy with that.. but I realized I need to calm down and feel positive about this problem.\nteacher: Yes you're right ...count to ten and keep calm....\nstudent: yes, I still remember the problem and solution.\nteacher: OK right...so in the intro maybe we might want to say (for the background sentence) something like: ' The number of teachers ___________ (go down) in recent decades.' Can you put the verb in the right tense?\nstudent: decline\nstudent: decrease\nteacher: So you copy the verb 'go down' - it's fine! But what tense??\nteacher: you can copy the verb\nstudent: declined/decreased/went down\nteacher: OK thanks so you;ve chosen the past simple which maybe seems logical BUT the time phrase 'in recent decades' means UP TO AND INCLUDING NOW so....we need the...??\nstudent: in this intro, do we need the structure of ' it is argued that...'\nstudent: we need the present continuous\nteacher: Um....not really beacuse the lack of teachers would be given as a fact not an opinion or disagree with you see?\nteacher: to agree or disagree with i mean\nstudent: ok, I understand\nteacher: OK so if i say 'this year' has the time finished?\nstudent: if we've got the exact date of this year, I think it's finished.\nteacher: Ah well if we say e.g. 24th March 2020 then yes it;s finished BUT if we ONLY say 'this year' has it finished?\nstudent: no ,it's not finished\nstudent: so we use present simple\nstudent: or present continuous\nteacher: OK good - so some time phrases AUTOMATICALLY need the past simple OR the present perfect OK? It depends on the phrase\nstudent: ok, I understand.\nteacher: So e.g. last year/last week/2018/ = ? (past simple or present perfect?)\nstudent: present simple because it is a specific time\nteacher: OK fine (you mean past simple right?!)\nstudent: yes\nteacher: OK!\nteacher: OK good! and one more...what about 'this morning'  ? Past simple or present perfect?\nteacher: IN real life today!\nstudent: this morning is...past simple I guess\nteacher: Yes good!\nstudent: because every day and every time is specific.\nteacher: Yes that's right - OK so finally: 'in recent decades'? Past simple or present perfect? Remember the logic of the essay question is : We have a problem NOW with a lack of teachers.\nstudent: let me think\nstudent: past simple!\nteacher: OK so remember the result will be either: 'In recent decades the number of teachers has gone down...' OR 'In recent decades the number of teachers went down....\nstudent: because in recent years is present perfect\nstudent: yes..\\in recent years\\\" indicates a long action, NOW is inside it\"\nteacher: YEs good! that keyword is 'recent' which makes us use the present perfect in English because ot means up to and including now you see? NOT a finished time with less connection to now...\nstudent: yes.. I think I can understand it now\nteacher: Yes I see what you mean about 'inside it' - i guess that;s true - in other words the number of teachers hasn't exactly STOPPED going down that's right\nteacher: We'll do more tomorrow with more essay intros ok?\nstudent: yes that is what I'd like to do\nteacher: OK great thanks Natalie see you tomorrow...\nstudent: see you\nstudent: cheers\nteacher: bye..\nstudent: thanks a lot\nstudent: bye..",
    "teacher: Hi Name: Emily Parker I'm ready to start whenever you are!\nstudent: Hi Mrs. Rodriguez.\nstudent: Sorry, I misunderstood your message\nteacher: hi there!\nteacher: No I realise - it's ok\nstudent: thanks\nteacher: Hi!\nteacher: How are you doing?\nstudent: I'm fine, just getting back from the supermarket... It's so not nice going there... The military controlling the entrance and exit\nstudent: How about you?\nteacher: Wow...right sounds pretty full on - Army workers like soldiers? ....yes i'm fine thanks - a bit more normal here so far\nstudent: yes, I guess they are soldiers, maybe sergeants or captains... Is there a word for all of them?\nstudent: About 'full on', I've seen it before but not sure about the meaning... I think it means that it sounds big (the situation)\nteacher: Um...well the ones you mention are officers .....soldiers in general are just...soldiers I guess in my English brain! Maybe military personnel is good here actually (more general - bit more formal too of course)\nstudent: Personal militar o militares en espa\u00f1ol :)\nteacher: Right yes - 'full-on' = informal but very common (depending on the speaker) just means intense/extreme etc\nstudent: could you give me some examples to see how you use it?? (full on)\nteacher: yes the we can't directly translate militares for people ...does it seem wrong to say soldados in Spanish in this context?\nstudent: If I was sure that they are 'soldados' I would say it but because I don't know I say 'militares'\nteacher: In following example I guess it includes the idea of (over the top - which is often true I realise!) 'He told me he loved me...I've only known him three weeks so it was all a bit full-on.'\nstudent: I see!\nstudent: It's an adjective then\nteacher: Also by the way it can just be a general intensifier like complete/total e.g. He's just a full-on dickhead (or whatever you want to say!) - yes adjective\nstudent: I understand\nteacher: But yes common for simple things like e.g. busy So really common actually would be ; ' it's pretty full-on at work  at the moment'\nteacher: Or anything demanding (school/work/course etc)\nstudent: A question\nstudent: well, 2 questions ;)\nteacher: Sorry one last one - often used about people as an individual adjective to just mean someone quite intense/energetic/extrovert (not always negative but could be)/\nteacher: Yes go ahead\nstudent: So, could you say that Anne is a bit full-on??\nteacher: YEs absolutely - just that..authentic!\nstudent: Ok, thanks\nteacher: ok...your questions....?\nstudent: I'm not sure about prepositions for ...full-on on the course\nstudent: I know... at school, at work but not sure about course\nteacher: Ok...you mean ...if you're doing one and it's full-on?\nteacher: Right I see yes..on the course we say\nstudent: Using the example you gave me earlier\nstudent: I see ON. I hate prepositions in English haha\nteacher: I guess similar idea = 'enrolled on' you see?\nteacher: Yes a common difficulty for people! But at least you have some to compare them with in Spanish (some of my students with more exotic first languages have no clue where to start!)\nstudent: And something I thought about this morning... You say I read in the morning/in the afternoon/ at night (no in the night, right?? do I have to say at night time?)\nteacher: yes good question hold on let me think!\nstudent: Yes, I completely agree, I shouldn't complain, luckily Spanish is not so different from English\nteacher: So ...my first thought is ..sometimes no difference...as in I keep waking up at night/in the night = both OK\nteacher: in the sense of 'during' both are possible\nteacher: BUT what time do you go to sleep at night = the only possibility ( a specific time = at\nteacher: so i woke up AT 5 a.m. you see?\nstudent: Yes, now I see the difference! Thanks\nteacher: No problem...fancy some examples of phrasal verbs with 'set'?!\nstudent: yes, please\nteacher: OK here are the words you need to choose from ....Up  Back Off By In Down About Off.....EXAMPLES coming!\nstudent: up, as in set up a company?\nteacher: 1. If we _________early, we should arrive in New York by lunchtime. 2. We need to ______ this task with great care. One mistake could cost us hours. 3.________ (me) just near the post office and I can walk from there. 4. What a lovely new car you've got! I bet that ________ (you) a huge amount of money. 5. The government needs to be careful that this recession doesn't ___________for many years or this country's economy will be permanently damaged. 6. My uncle is a bit eccentric and _________ (his watch) ______the first train of the day. He says it's never been late in thirty years! 7. They _______ business together only last August but then they argued over money and have now dissolved the company. 8. The broke open the safe, but they ________ the alarm and the police were waiting for them outside the bank.\nstudent: Wow\nteacher: Sorry is that too much!?\nstudent: No, it's great!\nteacher: you were right about set up a company by the way!\nteacher: ok ...do them in any order if you like\nstudent: So I have to use phrasal verbs only with SET??\nteacher: Yes that's right!\nstudent: Ok!\nstudent: 1 set off\nteacher: ok great (note you need the destination (or at least implicit)\nstudent: 2 no idea\nteacher: that's ok come back to it after elimination ok?\nstudent: ok\nstudent: Can I use a dictionary?? I don't know the meaning of the options so, no idea :(. I only know set up and set off\nteacher: yes sure hold on Name: Emily Parker - let me do something first...\nteacher: I had to buy a new laptop for online lessons recently \u2013 I got a good deal but it still set me back \u00a3700. Does this help for one of them?!\nteacher: It's better if I give you an example for context I think rather then use a dictionary OK?\nteacher: It's a real example!\nstudent: Yes, sure I prefer the examples. Thanks\nstudent: Does your example mean that you had to pay \u00a3700 extra?\nteacher: No just that it cost me \u00a3700. (but it implies in context a lot of money)\nteacher: Another one: When I get a taxi home I have to ask them to set me about 500m from my boat because the road gets too bad to drive on.\nteacher: sorry :set me down about 500m....\nstudent: So you use it when something is more expensive than you expected??\nteacher: Um..not really actually just to give the cost\nstudent: ok\nstudent: I understand 'set down' too\nstudent: you could say 'leave me 500..)\nteacher: as in: It cost me x = it set me back x ...(often for something that cost a lot - but not mroe than you expected!)\nstudent: ??\nteacher: Um...maybe not\nteacher: hold on - i;ve got Spanish interference..\nteacher: No weird - not impossible but...\nteacher: drop me here / drop me off here = common\nstudent: Then drop off = set down?\nteacher: Yes!\nteacher: Here's one Name: Emily Parker that I;ve changed a bit from the example above but is similar and a common example - You know I can\u2019t stop laughing when you do that impression. No don\u2019t do it! Don\u2019t set me off!\nteacher: Or e.g. My dad's got a real thing about GErmans- don't mention the war otherwise you'll set him off.\nstudent: I see. I think it means 'don't make me start'\nteacher: Yes actually - especially something like laughing or in the example i just sent?\nteacher: sorry exactly i meant not actually\nstudent: yes, I understand. Similar to 'activate'\nteacher: yes absolutely and in fact in the original example this would be a precise synonym  (less so for these recent examples but same idea)\nstudent: ok\nteacher: OK so one more: Although the situation in the uk is getting worse things are nuder control and panic has not yet set in\nteacher: under control\nteacher: Or maybe e.g. A cold spell of weather set in last week and it;s not going to warm up until the end of the month\nstudent: panic is not yet in the country??\nstudent: take place?? or something like that\nteacher: yes it hasn't started basically - in the second example is it going to or likely to continue/develop over time?\nteacher: start is the key idea\nteacher: is it likely to continue over time?\nstudent: In the second example it will continue I think, in the first one too but it may change\nteacher: yes OK fine - so often includes this idea of something starting and probably continuing\nstudent: ok\nteacher: typical collocations might be e.g. recession panic\nteacher: cold weather\nteacher: I;ve just repeated all three examples I know!\nteacher: but you get the idea i hope\nstudent: Yes, very useful thank you\nteacher: Name: Emily Parker do you want to quickly use the ones so far to give me a few answers before we finish?\nteacher: I;d say the ones we've done are the most common\nstudent: I'll try\nstudent: could you please paste it again here??\nteacher: OK ignore numbers 2 and 6!\nteacher: sorry yes here you are! 1. If we _________early, we should arrive in New York by lunchtime.  3.________ (me) just near the post office and I can walk from there. 4. What a lovely new car you've got! I bet that ________ (you) a huge amount of money. 5. The government needs to be careful that this recession doesn't ___________for many years or this country's economy will be permanently damaged.  7. They _______ business together only last August but then they argued over money and have now dissolved the company. 8. The broke open the safe, but they ________ the alarm and the police were waiting for them outside the bank.\nstudent: Thank you!\nstudent: 1. set off\nteacher: yep\nstudent: 3. set me down/   4. set you back\nteacher: yes good\nstudent: 5?? set in??\nstudent: It should be something like continue\nteacher: yes you're right\nteacher: start and continue (for many years)\nstudent: 7.set up\nteacher: yes\nstudent: set off\nstudent: or just set the alarm\nstudent: ?\u00e7\nteacher: yes ok great ...I'll give you a quick review tomorrow!  No here you need 'off' too - set the alarm is so it goes off later you know\nstudent: Ok, thank you very much!\nteacher: No probs - ok take care bye\nstudent: bye bye",
    "teacher: Hi Sophie Smith, all OK with you?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Been busy today?\nstudent: today nurses told to me my last quarantine day is  the 6th April.\nstudent: after that I can go back home.\nteacher: OK that's great right? I'm sure you;'e looking forward to going home?\nstudent: emm..I think it is fifty-fifty for me\nteacher: Um...sorry, how do you mean?\nstudent: 50% want to go home\nteacher: Oh i see what you mean sorry - half a percent = 0.5%!\nstudent: I will send to you my homework on yesterday's grammar\nteacher: Oh yes OK great - can you send it to me now?\nstudent: oh...I understand, it is my mistakes.\nstudent: yes\nteacher: ok\nstudent: I was hanging out in the city centre in Cambridge when I bought a second-hand book.\nstudent: I went to the National Gallery when I was visiting London.\nstudent: I majored in economics when I was studying in Japan.\nstudent: Students studied advanced mathematics when they were doing researches in economics.\nstudent: I was walking back home when I saw a UFO on the sky.\nstudent: I was reading poems when I tried to write some beautiful sentences.\nteacher: OK thanks Sophie Smith - yes that's good. You've definitely got the idea of the past simple/continuous relationship\nteacher: hold on - a couple of quick questions ....\nstudent: ok\nteacher: OK so graet grammar overall - just a couple of things to think about that I've marked with a '?'...any ideas on changes you need to make? Sophie Smith : I was hanging out at the city centre in Cambridge when I bought a second-hand book.  Sophie Smith : .I went to ____ ??National Gallery when I was trialing (??)to London. Sophie Smith : I majored in economics when I was studying in Japan. Sophie Smith : Students studied advanced mathematics when they were doing researches (??) on economics. Sophie Smith : .I was walking back home when I saw a UFO on(??) the sky. Sophie Smith : I was reading pomes when I trended (??) to write down some beautiful sentences.\nteacher: OK? Can you see the bits I'm asking about?\nstudent: the wrong past simple of words, right?\nteacher: Um..hold on a sec...\nteacher: Add a word in the gap and the second verb is not understandable....: I went to ____ ??National Gallery when I was trialing (??)to London.\nstudent: the\nteacher: yes good!.....\nstudent: because the National Gallery is specific,right?\nteacher: Well yes that's one way of looking at it - but this rule isn't always true I'm afraid!\nteacher: Hold on Sophie Smith - let's have a think about that now OK?\nstudent: ok, thanks\nteacher: We can caome back to your sentences later maybe - the important thing is that you have understood the past simple/continuous rule - well done\nstudent: yes, thanks a lot\nteacher: But the use of articles (the/a) is a grammar point that you should improve too - it will help your score...here we go....hold on!\nstudent: ok\nteacher: So Sophie Smith can you give me  sentence from the following keywords please?! :     Thames/London ? (You know what this is right?)   For example is I gave you these keywords :    Heathrow/London   you could say: Heathrow is an airport in London.  ...\nteacher: OK?\nteacher: So..Thames/London...give me a sentence if oyu can\nstudent: The Thames is a river in London.\nstudent: .\nteacher: OK thanks - I'll give you one back! 'The Yangtze is the longest river in China. Can you add a word in your example??'\nteacher: Just one little word!\nstudent: The Thames is a famous river in London.\nteacher: Hold on...my example was confusing I;m sorry - look at this one: 'The Yangtze River is in China.' Can you add a diffrent word!\nteacher: Sorry go ahead: for example:  '_______ River Thames is in London.'  ?\nstudent: The Yangtze River is the longest in China.\nteacher: OK cool ...so when we write/say the names of rivers we need/do not need 'the'?!\nstudent: The famous River Thames is in London\nstudent: we need I guess\nteacher: OK great so we always need to say 'the' with rivers OK?\nstudent: yes, I see\nteacher: One more Sophie Smith: Sahara/Africa ...give me a sentence!\nstudent: The Sahara is in Africa.\nteacher: Yes good - so we use 'the' with _____ and ______?\nstudent: The Sahara is the biggest desert in Africa.\nstudent: with rivers and deserts\uff1f\nstudent: or with place and name.\nteacher: Well hold on - a lot of the time yes BUT not always hold on....yes good with rivers and deserts...ok one more:       Pacific/world/biggest ...go for it!\nstudent: The Pacific is the biggest ocean in the world.\nstudent: so..with names and places?\nteacher: Yes perfect well done ...so we need 'the' with rivers/deserts/oceans!\nstudent: or something specific\nteacher: OK so....Remember my Heathrow example? Was there an article there?\nstudent: ok, I understand\nstudent: no..\nstudent: Heathrow is an airport in London.\nteacher: No! But Heathrow is a specific place of course - so it depends on the place I'm afraid. So Sophie Smith your example there ('The Heathrow....') is wrong...\nteacher: Look at these: Stansted is an airport just outside London./Cambridge University is very famous./King's Cross is a famous station in London. SO...we DO NOT use 'the' when we talk about 3 types of places (for example) : __________, __________ and ________??\nstudent: ok..I am confused about it.\nstudent: airport/university/station\nteacher: So YES we use the 'the' for rivers/deserts/oceans (for example) but we DO NOT use 'the' for example when we talk about .....yes, I see your answer! Correct - airports, universities/stations    You just have to remember these rules I;m afraid!\nstudent: ok, I got it - thanks\nteacher: OK Sophie Smith quick practice - so you might talk/write about these places in IELTS - give me an example of something you might say about each one of these 6 categories (rivers/deserts/oceans/stations/airports/universities)\nteacher: I mean with a specific example OK?\nteacher: With a name!\nstudent: ok.. I will try\nteacher: Sorry Sophie Smith I'll wait for your example but here's a quick idea to help you - Pollution is increasing in many rivers and oceans around hte world. For example, the Yangtze river in China is so polluted that there are no fish left'\nteacher: I'm sorry if that's not true! I should have chosen a different river!\nstudent: yes, I can understand\nteacher: ok....\nteacher: Try one before we have a break if you can....\nstudent: ok\nstudent: see you\nstudent: sorry, I am typing ...\nteacher: no problem ....I'll wait!\nstudent: The number of students' applications is increasing in many universities in the UK. For example, Cambridge University is the most popular university around the world with at least 100 thousand applications a year.\nstudent: popular\nteacher: OK thanks Sophie Smith - so you've got a grammatically correct example without 'the' = good! Lot sof other students will say 'The Cambridge University ' = wrong!! You will get a better mark than them!\nteacher: lots of other...i mean\nteacher: See you after the break...we'll do some essay intros OK?\nstudent: thanks a lot\nteacher: ok\nstudent: yes\nstudent: see you",
    "teacher: Hey welcome back\nstudent: yes, I am here\nteacher: OK cool - so Emily Smith let's imagine you get an essay about population OK?\nstudent: ok\nteacher: Probably it will be about population as a problem now right?\nteacher: NOT for example about population in the past!\nstudent: Population has been increasing around the world in recent years\nstudent: yes\nteacher: So for example (in bad English !!) the question might be something like ....Population big and up up up ..oh my god - what can we do to stop it? OK?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: OK fine - I've just seen your background sentence idea ...hold on\nteacher: OK so this is exactly what we need to practise Emily Smith!!\nteacher: So remember we said yesterday that if you say the word 'recent' this goes together with which verb tense??\nstudent: present continuous\nstudent: past continuous\nteacher: So for example the phrase 'in recent years' is talking about time beginning in the past (years ago) BUT up to now - so it's like a mixture of past and present you see? So which tense??\nstudent: was/were ___ing\nteacher: No past continuous has finished!\nteacher: I know it's before, during and after Emily Smith BUT only in relation to the past simple verb - it;s still finished you see?\nstudent: yes..\nteacher: So for example......The Black Death happened in the 14th century when population was increasing.\nteacher: So this is talking about the 14thcentury which ash definitely finished\nteacher: But for our essay intro we want (imagine) to talk about recent time - from past and up to NOW\nteacher: which tense??\nstudent: present perfect?\nteacher: YEs!\nteacher: So for example: 'Population _______  ________ significantly in recent decades.'??\nstudent: because time is not specific?\nteacher: Well remembered Emily Smith - this is an important use of the present perfect\nstudent: Population has increased significantly in recent decades.\nteacher: BUT there is another one!!\nstudent: so..because the action is continuing?\nteacher: Hold on sorry ....the point here is that the time has not finished you see - it ontinues up to the present so we need the present prefect ..yes! to your last question!\nstudent: You've got it!\nteacher: Yes your sentence was good: Population has increased significantly in recent decades.\nstudent: so.. if the action happened before but is still continuing, then we need to use present perfect to describe it, right?\nteacher: OR we can talk about population increasing now in our intro you see? We have these two options for our background sentence..For example : 'Population ____   _______ ing siginificantly (without the word 'recent' just in general at the moment!). Yes! to your last question by the way!.\nteacher: So here you need? Which tense?\nstudent: ok - Population has increased significantly.\nstudent: Population has increased significantly\nstudent: significantly.\nteacher: We're changing from the present perfect now because we are not using the word recent - we are just talking about population going up at the moment/now ...so which tense?\nteacher: So option 1: Population has increased in recent years. AND option 2: Population ___  _______ing ...\nteacher: (at the moment in general)\nstudent: present continuous\nteacher: Yes good! so...Population.....\nstudent: Population is increasing significantly.\nteacher: OK great! these are two common option for your background sentence OK?\nteacher: options\nstudent: yes!! I got it\nteacher: ok...hold on\nteacher: OK Emily Smith so here's another essay topic : Obesity (sorry that one again!) So..you can imagine they will say it;s a problem right?\nstudent: yes..\nteacher: OK so give me two versions of a background sentence about 'obesity' - one with present perfect and one with present continuous ..OK?\nstudent: ok\nteacher: ok...\nstudent: 1.Obesity has increased significantly in recent years.\nstudent: 2.Obesity is increasing significantly.\nstudent: could I use ' Obesity as an issue has...'  'Obesity as an issue is increasing..\nstudent: or just obesity itself is a problem?\nteacher: sorry internet went out....\nstudent: Don't worry, it always happens.\nteacher: well 'obesity' is automatically bad generally yes....You can just say 'obesity' or if you like 'The problem of obesity' but 'Obesity as a problem..' = less good\nteacher: Just say 'obesity' - it's best!\nstudent: ok, I understand - thanks\nteacher: ok..\nteacher: are you doing a present perfect background sentence for obesity?\nstudent: yes, Obesity has increased significantly in recent years.\nteacher: OK good yes! 'Obesity has increased significantly in recent years'. (without 'the')\nstudent: ok\nteacher: OK one more Emily Smith - I'' give you a title and you write a whole background sentence OK? hold on\nteacher: Discipline is an ever increasing problem in schools. Some people think this is the responsibilty of teachers and others the parents. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.\nteacher: You can try a whole intro if you like - or just the first sentence....\nstudent: ok\nteacher: ok...sorry the original is: 'some people think that discipline should be the responsibility..'.\nteacher: OK? so in other words it is NOT asking who is to blame/whose fault it is - it is only asking about who should be responsible!\nteacher: they do overlap in a way though it is true...ok sorry I'll stop and wait for you!\nstudent: It is increasingly argued that the most effective way to address the problem of discipline is responsibility. Although I strongly agree that responsibility plays a significant role, education system is more important.\nteacher: OK thanks Emily Smith ....so , in terms of language this is great......\nteacher: BUT...it doesn't really make sense I'm afraid!\nstudent: OR it is increasingly argued that responsibility is the most effective way to create a healthy education environment.\nteacher: So the question is asking who should be responsible for dealing with discipline problems ok? 'responsibilty' is not the solution to the problem - it is asking WHO should be responsible do you see? (your second example you;ve just written has the same problem - do you see? )\nteacher: Who should be responsible?' = who should deal with the problem right?\nstudent: yes..I see my mistakes\nteacher: ok...want to try again? You're not far away!\nstudent: yes\nteacher: ok...\nstudent: it is increasingly argued that teachers and parents should be responsible for solving discipline problems\nteacher: OK thanks Emily Smith ..hol don\nstudent: although I agree that teachers play an important role, parents are more necessary\nstudent: ok\nteacher: Ah OK..yes, this is better - nice and clear\nteacher: So your first sentence COULD just be an easy background done right? So the question says 'Disciple is an  ever increasing problem....'  so you could change this to the present perfect yousee?\nstudent: yes..but I know it is necessary to replace sentences and words to make it more normal.\nstudent: Discipline problems have increased significantly in recent years.\nteacher: Yes OK fine ...look: (for example) 'Standards of discipline in schools  have fallen significantly in recent years.'\nteacher: yes  ..your example is ok too!\nstudent: yes, it is best\nteacher: Mine is a bit better obviously :)\nteacher: OK thanks Emily Smith - we can review this on monday a bit ok?\nstudent: yes, I think so\nstudent: ok, I will do more thinking about it at the weekend\nteacher: OK speak soon ...thanks bye have a good weekend\nstudent: thanks a lot\nteacher: cheers!\nstudent: cheers",
    "teacher: Hi Emily Smith are you there?\nstudent: Hi Mr. Patel\nstudent: Are you alright?\nteacher: Hello - they've changed the settings for the timeout but it's still not working well enough obviously - I''ll follow this up again!  yes I'm fine thanks and you?\nstudent: I don't know what the problem is exactly...\nteacher: well basically it's supposed to start again after 10 mins of inactivity - it seemed to work yesterday ...\nstudent: Yes, I'm good... we have some good news on the islands... fewer cases!! so hopefully soon we'll be able to enjoy the outside\nteacher: I don't know what's exactly the problem...= I don't know what the problem is (sorry couldn't stop myself)\nteacher: OK that is good news - I hope the rules change soon then\nstudent: Ohh yes, thank you. Please don't stop yourself from correcting me!! I really appreciate it when you do it !\nteacher: I saw that things were calming down a bit...I think in some ways the world has handled/is handling this pretty well...\nstudent: yourself\nteacher: ok ok I will\nteacher: yes good correction\nteacher: sorry about my typos\nstudent: no worries\nteacher: Yes as i say ..in the movie version we'd 've  the total breakdown of law and order but in reality...\nteacher: we'd've' had i meant\nteacher: I know it's not exactly the plague though....\nstudent: I think I know what you mean but is 'in the movie version' a sentence or a expression?\nteacher: um...well not exactly a set expression but natural and easily understood ...i.e. i'f we were in a movie' but maybe a bit snappier...\nteacher: if they made a film of this stuff / about this it would...etc\nstudent: I understand, I like it!\nteacher: ok...\nteacher: I'm trying to make myself just use natural speech with a student of your level\nteacher: which sounds like a contradiction i know\nstudent: I think it's a good idea!! So many new things for me :)\nteacher: OK yes good ....Emily Smith listen ..making comparisons ...I wanted to focus on that a bit ok?\nstudent: Yes but\nstudent: a question about yesterday, can I?\nteacher: yes of  c urse go ahead\nstudent: I don't know the difference between 'set about' and 'set in'. Do both mean 'start or begin'?? Another question I just realised I'm not sure about is the difference between 'begin' and 'start'... Sorry, maybe too much?\nteacher: no that's ok! hold on a sec....\nteacher: I can't think of any significant difference re start and begin hold on\nteacher: both similar in terms of register (formality) and collocation\nteacher: one difference however that occurs to me is e.g. 'start' is for causation\nteacher: e.g. 'start a fire' not 'begin'\nteacher: ok?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: When i say 'similar' and 'no significant difference' by the way I mean NO, NO difference at all! except that last point...\nteacher: Hey did you see the abbreviation there before (meaning about?)\nteacher: meaning 'about'\nstudent: That's enough for me, I thought that maybe there were important differences I didn't know\nteacher: no - it feels like maybe there must be but no!\nstudent: Great, thanks\nteacher: ok\nteacher: and...set about and set in..hold on\nteacher: set about = start doing something, often with energy/determination i.e. set about dealing with a problem or (humurously) set about eating a large cake - you see?)\nteacher: so a PERSON sets about doing something\nteacher: but 'set in' = intranstive e.g. cold weather sets in AND also likely to continue for a while remember\nteacher: So you can't set in something\nteacher: OK?\nstudent: Yes, very clear now (I think). Thank you\nteacher: no probs\nteacher: Before i forget Emily Smith - did you see the abbreviation 're' before?\nstudent: No\nteacher: I can't think of any significant difference re start and begin\nteacher: see it?!\nstudent: yes, I didn't notice it before\nteacher: `any ideas?\nstudent: no idea, I think it means 'between'. Is it a Latin word or English?\nteacher: English! Imagine a letter and at the top it says 'Re: Job application 12755''\nteacher: It's short for....'regarding' or 'with regard to'\nstudent: reference\nteacher: Some people say it too (like e.g. and i.e.) so it sounds like 'ree' of course\nstudent: ahhh ok\nteacher: ok!\nteacher: good idea ...reference would be 'Ref:'\nstudent: ok\nteacher: sorry not 'of course' for the pronunciation exactly!\nteacher: it's arbitrary\nteacher: unlike e.g and i.e.\nteacher: Any other questions Emily Smith?\nstudent: No, thanks\nstudent: We can continue with your plan :)\nteacher: OK.....so imagine: comparing 2 tablets let's say (!)  Samsung = \u00a3100 and ipad = \u00a3825 (not exactly right I know but...so my question is : how can you compare those two things for example? A simple sentence...?)\nstudent: The Samsung tablet (is it correct) is cheaper than the ipad\nstudent: The ipad is considerably or much more expensive than the tablet\nstudent: considerably\nteacher: OK thanks so : The Samsung tablet (is it correct - yes!) ) is cheaper than the ipad  : The ipad is considerable= considerablY / much more expensive than the ipad\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: Considerably = correct of course ...a little bit formal - other formal options = signifcantly etc less formal options might include.....??\nstudent: meaning considerably/significantly??\nteacher: yes\nstudent: I don't know\nteacher: OK so, you know 'far' of course ..this is really common\nstudent: yes\nteacher: apart from 'a lot more' of course  (=the number one in informal frequency i guess)\nstudent: is far more expensive or far cheaper than\nstudent: ??\nteacher: Yes correct.....and how about 'way' ? as in 'it's way more expensive'  -\nstudent: Yes, I know them all but I don't use them (I should)\nteacher: OK yes I understand - this is kind of why I wanted o focus on it because with the CAE questions the tendency/temptation is to stick with basic structures\nteacher: OK and a couple more hold on...\nteacher: so I reckon that the negative forms probably come less quickly to your mind when speaking too ...for example: 'The Samsung tablet is nowhere ________  _________ expensive _______ the ipad'?\nstudent: near as as\nteacher: OK good - do you use this one when  speaking?\nstudent: no, never\nteacher: OK! common though ...so if you did it would sound good!\nteacher: What about the slightly more basic: 'x isn't as expensive/good/whatever as y'?\nstudent: yes, the basic is the only one I use\nstudent: as...as\nstudent: what I don't use is 'nowhere near as...as'\nteacher: ok i see yes...and remember the 'weak form' : e.g. \u0259zt\u0283\u026a\u02d0\u0259z\nteacher: sorry: \u0259zt\u0283\u026a\u02d0p\u0259z\nstudent: what??\nteacher: Ha hold on\nteacher: you know the 'scwha' right?\nteacher: the weak vowel sound?\nstudent: no, I don't\nstudent: I'm totally lost right now haha\nteacher: Oh sorry ....Um... difficult without audio! You know...an unstressed vowel in English is usually the same sound ...like in the phrase 'fish and chips' how do English people say 'and' in that phrase\nteacher: Not like this right: /\u00e6nd/\nteacher: we say: /\u0259n/ !\nteacher: Can you hear it in your head??\nteacher: like: 'fishenchips'!\nstudent: yes\nteacher: And e.g. how do we normally say the word 'are'? We don't say 'ahhhh' like we are at the dentist ..we just say the tiny sound /\u0259/ for the whole word ...like in : How\u0259you?\nteacher: OK sorry ..so ...the phrase e.g. 'it is not as cheap as' when said quickly is like:    'snot\u0259zcheap\u0259z' - that's what i meant ....\nteacher: Sorry , have i lost you?!\nteacher: Difficult to make this clear in this format!\nstudent: haha no, I finally know what you wanted to say earlier\nteacher: ok thank god\nstudent: Sure, very difficult to talk about pronunciation without having an opportunity to hear it\nteacher: yes of course...\nstudent: Very clear now! thanks\nteacher: OK cheers - well i guess our time is basically up...it seemedto go quickly today (maybe not for you!)\nstudent: Yes, very quickly!!\nstudent: Thank a lot!\nteacher: No probs - I'll emial you re(!) next week in a bit ok?\nstudent: See you next week! Have a good weekend\nteacher: OK cheers and you\nstudent: yes, please. Whenever is good for you after 4\nstudent: Bye bye",
    "teacher: Hi Emily, how's it going? Good weekend?\nstudent: Good afternoon Mr. Rodriguez, today I left the hotel where I had been quarantined for 14 days\nteacher: OK right! Where are you now then?\nstudent: I'm staying at a hotel near the airport in order to take a plane tomorrow.\nstudent: how was your weekend?\nteacher: Yes fine thanks - we are in 'lockdown' in the UK not too so we can't really go out...\nstudent: yes, it is necessary I believe.\nteacher: Yes - it seems to be working. The number of cases is falling (in China too I think right?)\nstudent: yes, it is really useful, because just a few people are testing positive for COVID-19 every day\nstudent: or for COVID-19..\nteacher: yes I see...(positive 'for' a disease - impossible to know sorry!)\nteacher: e.g. Hardly anyone is testing positive for Coronavirus now.\nstudent: ok, I can remember this stuff now.\nteacher: OK..Emily I thought I'd give you a topic and ask for a few main ideas OK?\nstudent: thanks for always helping me study basic grammar stuff!\nstudent: yes, let' start\nteacher: That's OK we can do more of the basic grammar stuff too all right?!\nstudent: yes!\nteacher: OK so the thi s is the idea: Video games have a range of negative effects and playing them should be discouraged. To what extent do you agree?\nteacher: Any main idea you could include for this? Don't worry about the language too much ...just a quick basic idea if you can...\nstudent: I agree with this idea\nteacher: OK...\nstudent: Because I wasted a huge amount of time on video games. As a result, I got a low mark in my term tests when I was a middle school student.\nstudent: I wasted - take out 'was'\nteacher: OK! Good example - so main idea = it's a waste of time right? Good to delete 'was' well done\nteacher: Were you addicted to them?\nstudent: yes\nstudent: when I was a middle school student I couldn't stop myself from playing them.\nteacher: OK, so maybe the danger of addiction is a better main idea than 'it's a waste of time' OK?\nteacher: Right, you mean: you couldn't stop thinking about them&gt;\nteacher: ?\nstudent: yes, because I was addicted to them\nteacher: OK thanks - can you put a verb in this sentence?\nteacher: addicted' = adjective\nstudent: because I was addicted to them\nteacher: ok good! So addiction is a possible problem - anything else?\nstudent: children tend to copy bad behaviours from games.\nteacher: OK thanks - quick example so I get the idea?\nstudent: because they don't know enough to recognise easily which behaviours are good or bad.\nteacher: OK understood - 'bad behaviour'...for example?\nstudent: they don't respect their parents or teachers possibly.\nteacher: ok...one more negative effect if you can (don't worry if not!)\nstudent: and they attempt to break regulations whether at schools or at home, because they just want to copy the behaviours that they see in games.\nstudent: they attempt ( I forgot the subject ).\nteacher: OK thanks Emily - so in other words the games have _______ content which has a bad __________ on young people.  adjective for first gap and then noun for second gap - any ideas?\nteacher: The games have _______ content which has a bad __________ on young people.'\nstudent: the games have violent content, which has a bad influence on young people.\nteacher: Yes very good, especially 'influence' - negative is possible .... how about: 'uns______' or 'inapp_________'?\nstudent: unsatisfactory\nteacher: unsuit_ _ _ _ '??\nstudent: unsuitable?\nteacher: yes good!\nteacher: And ...'inapprop_ _ _ _ _ '??\nstudent: and...inappropriate\nteacher: yes great...so either of these words would be good to use here OK?\nteacher: Can I suggest Emily that it would be good to have a clear idea of exactly what the bad behaviour is?!\nteacher: Do you mean 'vioence' for example?\nteacher: violence I mean!\nteacher: Would this be a good example do you think?\nstudent: the games have unsuitable/inapproppriate content which has a bad influence on young people.\nstudent: yes, violence\nteacher: OK cool ...so we've got two main ideas right: addiction and violence\nteacher: Anything else...? This would be enough but just wanted to ask...!\nstudent: some games are just for people who have negative emotions which they want to make disappear\nteacher: Do you mean: 'some games are just for people who have negative emotions which they want to make disappear'?\nstudent: Adults always understand the limits of a game, but children do not\nstudent: yes, I will find a word\nstudent: relieve one's feelings\nteacher: OK good idea...so , you can 'relieve pain' for example...in more common language we can say e.g. they play games to stop feeling depressed\nteacher: or lonely or bored etc\nstudent: ok\nteacher: Before you said: 'adults always can realise the game word, but children are not'...after the verb 'realise' you need to say '...that + clause (subject and verb)...' can you try it?\nstudent: so..they play games to stop feeling depressed/lonely/bored.\nteacher: yes ok...E.g. I realized that smoking was bad when I read the news.'\nteacher: Try your sentence with 'realise' again if you can ok?\nstudent: Adults can realise that they are playing a game, but children are not able to do so.\nteacher: OK thanks Emily ...you need a subject + present continous (2 extra words in total!)\nstudent: adults can realise that they are playing a game, but children are not able to do so.\nteacher: THanks Emily - sorry, but I want to test you on this... So you said: 'Adults can realise that they playing game.' You're using the present continuous but remember you need to use this structure 'be (is/are) + ______ing' Can you see the missing word in your sentence?\nstudent: they are playing games, but children are not.\nstudent: yes, i found my mistake\nteacher: ok....\nteacher: Yes sorry i see it -good!\nstudent: thanks\nteacher: Try to remember this OK? YOU make this mistake a lot!\nstudent: yes, I need to check this point every time when I want to use present continuous.\nteacher: OK so hold on...we have 2 ideas: addiction and violence...and the third (is it this negative emotions idea? ...or children don't realise it is not real idea? Are either of these ideas good for this idea do you think?\nstudent: children don't realise it is not real\nstudent: yes..\nteacher: OK ...but how is th is bad exactly? I;m just wondering how you can develop this into a paragraph you know?\nstudent: yes, I understand, so.. I need to replace words with synonyms, right?\nteacher: Well, I'm not sure about the idea itself to be honest....it's not wrong perhaps but ...hold on\nstudent: ok\nteacher: I just think it's good to think about main ideas which are easy to explain or give examples for....I know we might have different ideas about this but i feel that this idea is a bot more difficult to make successful in an essay - it's a bit vague/abstract do you see what i mean?\nteacher: THe addiction and violence ideas are easier to explain I think ..do you agree??!!\nstudent: yes I agree\nstudent: it is easy to give examples and reasons.\nteacher: yes exactly...what happens with ideas that are vague/abstract is that students just repeat the main idea again and again you see\nstudent: yes, I see it\nteacher: Can is suggest one more negative idea that I feel is possible (but not necessary) ? Sometimes poeple say that playign video games all the time stops kids from making friends/being social...OK?\nstudent: and with more repeated sentences the essay becomes more vague.\nstudent: yes, I agree with it\nteacher: Yes you're right...you're not developing your ideas/arguments ...also you tend to repeat the same language\nteacher: OK thanks Emily - we'll develop these ides after the break OK? bye for now...\nteacher: ideas!\nstudent: yes, thanks\nteacher: ok\nstudent: see you\nstudent: see you",
    "teacher: Hi there...\nstudent: hi\nstudent: I am here.\nteacher: OK Emily so let' s imagine you're written your intro for this essay already ok? LEt's start with a main paragraph...which one? Addiction? OK?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: IF you agree...give me your first sentence of you first main paragraph on this main idea? OK? I'll give you a minute.....\nstudent: one of the main reasons why playing video games has a negative influence on young people is that games are associated with them.\nstudent: addicted\nteacher: OK Emily thanks...OK great  - I can see you've really remembered about this idea of topic sentences....\nteacher: clear and direct with the main idea at the beginning...good!\nstudent: yes, I always review them after a class with you\nteacher: OK so now you can add some more right? An explanation (i.e. what does it mean to be addicted) ...an example...or whatever...(we'll come back to the exact language you've used a bit later OK?)\nteacher: So..next sentence..go for it!\nstudent: children are not easy to stop from playing games whether in the day or at night because they are attracted to the content of games.\nteacher: OK good...this is what means to be addicted i.e. you can't stop ...good! OK so a bit more about how/why this is bad.....!\nstudent: as a consequence, young people don't have the time to do some useful things, such as being sociable and  reading.\nteacher: OK great .... a clear reason about why this is bad ...hold on a sec....\nstudent: ok\nteacher: So that's 67 words - if you had three main paragraphs that could be enough....imagine you've got  2....can you add a final sentence?!\nstudent: in my opinion, although some video games can improve attention, they lead to a huge waste of time in children's life.\nstudent: attention\nteacher: OK Emily , thanks a lot for that paragraph!  Here it is!   'One of the main reasons why playing video games have negative influence on young people is that games are associated to them. Children are not easy to stop playing games whenever in a day or at night, because they were attracted by context of games. As a consequence, young people don't have time to do some useful things for their life, such as being social and reading. In my opinion, although some video games are able to improve some abilities of attrition, a lot time wasting children's life.'\nteacher: OK so basically this is a solid paragraph in terms of the main idea and its development. good!\nstudent: a lot of time is wasted in children's life - sorry I forgot to check the present continuous.\nstudent: present continuous\nteacher: You have 1. a topic sentence 2. Explanation of topic sentence 3. Result and 4. Summary with a bit on the other side (very good!).\nstudent: ok, thanks!!\nteacher: You've got some good 'chunks' of language...hold on!\nteacher: One of the main reasons why playing video games negative influence on young people is that .......can you add an article ('a') and think about the agreement of verb and subject?? i.e. it has/they have\nteacher: So add 'a' somewhere and change one verb to the singular!\nstudent: One of the reasons why it has a negative influence on young people\nteacher: OK Emily thanks for trying! Here you go: One of the main reasons why playing video games HAS A negative influence on young people is that\nteacher: Sorry I see I deleted the verb 'have' from your original when I copied it!\nteacher: Anyway...playing video games = singular ok!?\nstudent: ok..\nstudent: so 'video games' is singular, right?\nteacher: games are associated to them' ..this bit needs changing! Let me give you a model to help: 'Many people are addicted to drugs.' Can you try your bit again?\nteacher: One of the main reasons why playing video games has a negative influence on young people is that ......?\nstudent: Many children are addicted to the content of games.\nteacher: OK so your original was: '...is that games are addicted to them'....You need to say   '.....is that they ______ addicted ______ them.'  ??\nstudent: one of the main reasons why playing games has a negative influence on young people is that they get addicted to them.\nteacher: OK yes perfect! You can say something (e.g. playing video games) is 'addictive' OK?\nteacher: So '....is that it is addictive.'  is also possible\nteacher: OK Emily...you said: 'Children are not easy to stop playing games...' hold on\nstudent: yes, ok\nstudent: thanks\nstudent: ok\nstudent: sorry... internet issues\nteacher: A model to help: You have two choices (both possible/correct) - copy one of them to change you bit OK? Here are the two models: 1. I find it easy to get up early. 2. IT is not easy for me to get up early.\nteacher: OK?\nstudent: ok\nstudent: it is not easy for children to give up games.\nteacher: OK cool..you've got it!\nstudent: children find it is not easy to give up games.\nstudent: yea..thanks\nteacher: Yes ....Children do not find it easy to ....=better OK? (negative with first verb = normal)\nteacher: OK Emily ...let's jump to this bit OK? Look: although some video games are able to improve some abilities of attrition\nteacher: What's this word? 'attrition'??\nstudent: I think it means concentrate on something\nteacher: Ah ok - you mean 'attention'!\nstudent: yes,\nstudent: it is spelling mistakes.\nteacher: OK fine no problem so...now, these two: can/be able to...\nteacher: They are both possible for ABILITY e.g. I can /I am able to read\nstudent: ok\nteacher: BUT in your example you don't mean ABILITY you mean POSSIBILTY OK?\nteacher: This is the way we often use modal verbs (can/might/could etc) in IELTS essays ....so here you need 'can' OK?\nstudent: ok, so...although some video games can improve attention.\nteacher: Yes OK better!  with  these words : ability/attention/concentration the follow'ng are possible/best:  'the ability to concentrate/pay attention' OR improve attention/concentration' OK?!\nteacher: So in other words 1. the ability to + verb OR 2. improve + noun\nstudent: yes, I understand them, thanks\nteacher: OK cool! Final chunk Emily = 'a lot time wasting children's life'.\nteacher: THe full version was although some video games are able to improve some abilities of attrition, a lot time wasting children's life.\nteacher: So after the comma you need a clause OK?!  (a subject and verb)\nteacher: E.g. 'Although I am rich, I am unhappy' do you see the two clauses after 'although'\nteacher: Can you add a subject/verb in  'a lot time wasting children's life' to make it correct?\nstudent: spending a lot of time playing video games is wasting children's life\nstudent: children are wasting a lot of time on games.\nteacher: OK thanks Emily - So 1. Spending a lot of time playing them is a waste of children's life = possible good. And 2. do you need the passive? IF children is the subject?\nstudent: Children are wasting a lot of time playing them.\nstudent: Children are wasting a lot if time playing them.\nteacher: Um so passive not needed here! Children are the subject and what do they do? THey waste time! OK?\nteacher: OK thanks a lot Emily ...let me show your final paragraph with our changes! You're not far away - just keep going! One of the main reasons why playing video games has a negative influence on young people is that that they are addicted to them. Children do not find it easy to stop playing games whether during the day or at night, because they are so attracted by these games. As a consequence, young people don't have time to do more useful things, such as being social or reading. In my opinion, although some video games can improve concentration, children often waste their time on them.\nteacher: It's still got that great structure just with some more accurate language - you're on the right track!\nteacher: OK we'll stop there for today - I'll speak to you on Wednesday right? Have a good journey! Bye\nstudent: thanks!!!  but I think another problem for me is that it is not easy to find keywords in each sentences\nstudent: yes,,see you on Wednesday!!\nstudent: bye\nteacher: Yes of course I understand ....keep building up vocabulary ...you'll get there!\nteacher: OK bye!\nstudent: ok, thanks a lot",
    "teacher: Hi there...I just started your name in the user name box instead of mine...I must be tired!\nstudent: haha Hi Ms. Jasmine Patel! I was surprised to see Jamie there... that's what my parents call me\nstudent: surprised\nteacher: OK I see - yes I got Ms. Johnson\nteacher: That's WHAT my parents call me  I mean\nstudent: Nice :)\nteacher: Is Mr. Martin Johnson a normal name in Spain? Because it's quite unusual here...\nstudent: Yes, it is normal but just for old people haha. I find it very funny to hear how names have different uses in different countries\nteacher: Oh really? I see - so it must sound old-fashioned! Is it more religious maybe?\nstudent: Do you know what I mean?? For example, most popular names for newborn children in Spain are considered old-fashioned names (grandparents' names) in Argentina\nstudent: and the other way round\nstudent: Yes maybe religion explains why Mr. Martin Johnson was a popular name 60 years ago\nteacher: Yes I see what you mean - it's a constant cycle ....but slightly out of sync in different places yes....do you know the names for little kids in the UK noW?\nteacher: Maybe you do actually cos you worked with kids right?\nstudent: I've forgotten... Tell me! I'm curious\nteacher: Ha good question hold on a sec\nstudent: Leo, Oliver, Daniel, Mark, Isabella...\nstudent: Leo, Oliver, Daniel, Mark, Isabella...I remember these ones\nstudent: Ohh sorry, it didn't work the first time I pressed\nteacher: Yes ....maybe a bit posh (Leo!) yours,..\nteacher: Other posh ones from my daughter's school = Oliver/Harry/George/Charles\nteacher: Actually not only posh though - that's not quite ttrue!\nstudent: Yes they were... and then very unusual names from other countries, Ishita, Haruka....\nteacher: And for girls stuff like: Olivia/ Amelia/isla/Freya/Rosia?Ellie\nstudent: In my class  there was a very posh Camila\nteacher: Less traditional ones for boys that are popular now = e.g. Archie\nstudent: And Isla (I like this one, very original) and Freya\nteacher: Most of them end in vowels and are a bit 'babyish' that's the fashion!\nteacher: Yes Camilla = posh!\nteacher: It's funny when some non-natives think of John as a common name - if I imagine a baby in a pram called John I imagine a deep gravelly voice coming out like in MOnty Python or seomthing!\nstudent: Yes, her family were (I would say was but I think it's plural??) very posh, her grandparents took her to school everyday wearing a suit and tie and granny wore dresses very similar to the ones that the queen wears...\nteacher: Ha that's funny! 'family' can be both but more common in plural in normal speaking\nteacher: er grandparents took her to school everyday wearing suit and tie and granny wore dresses very similar to the ones that  the queen wears.\nstudent: ha ha about John, yes it's funny because I'd imagine that is a very common name...\nteacher: a suit and tie\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: Not any more! I think there's hardly anyone under the age of 40 called John! (I mean literally anyone!)\nteacher: Happy with this change Emily Johnson? Her Gran was wearing dresses like the Queen = Her Gran wore...?\nstudent: Sorry, I'm lost now... Would it be correct to say 'they took her... every day wearing a suit and tie and grandma wearing dresses like the Queen'?\nteacher: Sure sorry ...hold on! So, not it's a getting a bit Spanish there...hold on sec!\nstudent: Or maybe better 'when they took her to school, the grandfather wore a suit and tie and grandma wore dresses like the Queen's\nstudent: haha A lot of Spanish there for sure!!!\nteacher: Yes better. So normal would be: ' They would/used to take her to a school in a suit and tie and her grandma used to/wore a dress\nteacher: sorry: would/used to wear or just wore\nteacher: Or e.g. 'they'd go to school with her in a/wearing a  suit and tie and her grandma in a dress\nstudent: I see, thank you\nteacher: But you need 'with' to make the 'wearing' possible you see?\nstudent: No, let me see\nstudent: So, you mean that I couldn't say 'they'd take her to school wearing...???\nteacher: No sorry you're right - that's fine too\nstudent: ok\nstudent: by the way, what's your daughter's name??\nteacher: Amy\nstudent: Nice, I like it\nteacher: Unconsciously influenced by the existence of Amy Winehouse I realise in retrospect - not the best model perhaps\nstudent: It's so short, in Spain names are much longer I think\nteacher: Yes I see - it's true that we like short names\nstudent: hahah maybe not the best model but a great singer\nteacher: Yes a great singer - you know it;s weird right that the influences on names are mostly unconscious - people don't intentionally name kids after a famous person often\nstudent: I think in Spain we usually use names with 3 syllabus\nteacher: For example?\nteacher: Choose = best by the way for 'names'\nstudent: Mar\u00eda, Natalia, Noelia, Elena,\nteacher: Use' with name sounds like e.g. a false name\nstudent: I understand (choose)\nteacher: yes or maybe e.g. use a nickname or something\nteacher: not  the original choice!\nstudent: Maybe shorter names for boys... just 2 syllabus David, Daniel, Mart\u00edn, Hugo...\nstudent: Yes, veryyyy common nicknames here\nteacher: Yes I see your examples for girls - the famous MAria (still as popular as ever?!)\nteacher: By the way MAry feels very old-fashioned in English now\nstudent: Yes, it is... but just Mar\u00eda. In the past it was Mar\u00eda something else (Mar\u00eda Candelaria, Mar\u00eda Vanesa, Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9, Mar\u00eda del Carmen) haha very long\nstudent: Well, you also have 2 names in the UK, don't you? Why do some people have 2 and some have just 1?\nstudent: I mean first and middle name\nteacher: Yes I remember in Spain I had to remember the names of the kids in the class and it was tough because they did often share the same/similar names\nteacher: Um..yeah the two names thing - I have a feeling that middle names are just less important in the UK\nstudent: What do you mean by 'did often share the same names?\nteacher: 5 MArias, 4 Juans etc!\nstudent: haha I see (Juanes)\nstudent: poor you, I've been there trying to learn names like Haruka\nteacher: Yes...this is the phantom auxiliary ...so the did (looking back) was just for emphasis (just a touch) as in: 'WE mentioned before that some names are very common e.g. Maria and yes it it true actually that when  I was in Spain they WERE all called MAria (OK?)\nteacher: So instead of just: THey shared the same name = They DID all share the same name...\nteacher: But not really strong!\nstudent: No sorry, what I didn't get was the meaning of 'share' to talk about people with the same name... I thought you could share a sandwich or a flat but not a name... Now I know that my friend and I share the same name (because we are both called Sophia Chen)\nstudent: Am I right??\nteacher: Sorry I'm with you! Yes that's right, you can 'share' the same name in English (normal /common verb here) Yes you know Emily Johnson that in my job in the UK now I have to learn a classful of names from all over the world virtually every week! It's funny when the CHinese students (god bless them) choose an 'English' name - they often choosevery odd examples ...either very obscure/old-fashioned ones or words that aren't really names like 'Jacket' (for example!)\nstudent: hahahah that's very funny\nteacher: You're happy with 'share' for other things too right? Like New York and London share the same number of art galleries (stupid example but you get the idea?)\nstudent: I'm laughing\nteacher: Ha! Yes there are many many more...\nstudent: no, I didn't know that use either...\nteacher: Ah OK interesting ...maybe less overlap than I thought with the verb share then (I mean with Spanish) ...\nteacher: How about e.g. They share the distinction of being the only authors to win the Booker Prize twice?\nstudent: I think so, we would use the verb 'to have' for that\nteacher: Bit random - just popped in there!\nteacher: OK yes i see\nteacher: So Emily Johnson - basically my name (back to me again) is what i like to think of as a cool name in the UK BUT if i go to Spain/Italy etc it's just boring/normal or even old-fashioned! Upsetting...\nstudent: hahah Yes, I'm sorry to tell you\nteacher: But yours is unusual right?\nstudent: Not on the Canary Islands, it's originally from here so there are a lot of Sophia Chen but not on (in?) the mainland.\nteacher: Ah OK i see - I didn't consider you had kind of indigenous names etc! 'On the mainland' = good ..on an island etc\nstudent: There are many Canarian? names: Yeray, Gara, Jonay, Yaiza,\nstudent: Yes, that's the only thing we've kept from the language of the first population on the islands... their names\nteacher: Wow - yes I see, really distinctive (it seems to me) ...yes Canarian =correct but I guess most English people would probably say 'from the Canary Islands' due to lack of familiarity I'm afraid!\nteacher: OK amazing - any basic info on this population?!\nstudent: They came from the north of Africa and they lived in caves\nteacher: OK I see - I've never considered this...\nteacher: So Arabic-speaking?\nstudent: They were farmers and also grew vegetables\nteacher: This is inspiring me to visit...\nteacher: some time after the apocalypse\nstudent: About the language, we always say that they spoke 'guanche', that's the name of the culture\nstudent: their culture I mean and their language\nstudent: Yes, I think the islands are nice!\nstudent: I think it's time! Thank you very much\nstudent: See you tomorrow\nteacher: Ok i see - I'm going to have a look a this online so I'm less ignorant next time...yes I'm sure they are lovely! OK yes  I guess we'll stop there then ok cheers bye\nteacher: it's time\nteacher: sorry\nstudent: Ok thanks\nstudent: bye bye",
    "teacher: Afternoon Emily Johnson....\nstudent: Hello Ms. Garcia.\nteacher: How's it going? Still stuck indoors I guess?\nstudent: I'm well, yes, still at home\nstudent: How are you?\nteacher: Yeah me too - well not great really ...ironically I would be indoors anyway cos of my dodgy leg...but today I am going a bit potty to be honest .....can't wait to get better!\nstudent: ohh sorry to hear that\nstudent: what does potty mean??\nteacher: It means....doolally!\nteacher: bonkers?\nteacher: mad!\nstudent: Ha mad, I know mad!!\nteacher: Lots of synonyms! The same in Spanish I guess!\nteacher: I think potty and doolally are British only by the way\nteacher: As in not used in the US I think\nstudent: Yes, a lot of synonyms in Spanish too for mad\nteacher: Just to be clear - you can probably guess but they are kind of light-hearted/humorous words - not like psycho etc which often implies a real problem/violence etc\nteacher: Although 'psycho' = noun for a person of course\nteacher: So no, I'm not a psycho - just going a bit potty!\nstudent: haha Ok, good to know\nteacher: OK....how about....not being able to do exercise is 'doing my head in'?\nteacher: Familiar?\nstudent: no\nteacher: Ah ok...this one really is common (informal but common)\nstudent: making me crazy'??\nteacher: Yes exactly (driving me crazy = more common by the way)\nstudent: ok\nteacher: Also - driving me nuts/mad/crazy = very common\nstudent: Why nuts??\nteacher: Ah I don't know...again, British only I think..but common synonym for mad ....your nut can be your head ...which is probably the origin\nteacher: but nuts as adjective (in phrase drive me nuts)  is much more normal that using nut as noun for head\nstudent: I see\nteacher: Or just 'he's nuts' /'it was nuts' or whatever\nstudent: It sounds very funny to me because I think of nuts as walnuts and almonds...\nteacher: yes I see! I guess that connection doesn't occur to us really  of course\nteacher: Hey Emily Johnson...what does your head in?\nstudent: No, of course not\nteacher: Random examples for me: tailgaters (you know?)\nstudent: My neighbours talking on the phone very loudly on their balcony (happening right now and very often these days)\nteacher: My wife calls them 'haemorrhoids' (on the road)\nstudent: tailgaters?\nstudent: I know, I just checked!\nteacher: yes I've always though of this as American English but it just means 'people who drive right up behind you' - hence the haemorrrhoids' idea (as joke obviously)\nteacher: Ah you know that the phrase 'right up my arse' is common right? Vulgar (sorry) but common informally\nteacher: As in 'right behind me'\nstudent: haha funny name your wife gives them\nteacher: Yes...she'll just say now : 'I've got one!' if it happens\nteacher: Yes I get the thing about talking loudly on the phone - common in Spain I imagine!\nstudent: it doesn't do my head in when driving (I know it's wrong but I don't know how to...)\nteacher: Um..how do you mean? YOu mean the tailgaters?\nteacher: E.g. 'It doesn't do my head in when people drive right behind me.'?\nstudent: yes, but my question is about 'get my head in' is it right??\nteacher: No....\nteacher: get'?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: No you can't say 'get my head in' but hold on...what do you want to say?\nstudent: I'm speaking in general... there are people who easily get annoyed with other drivers for many reasons (for example tailgaters). What I was trying to say is that I'm generally very calm when I drive maybe because our roads are different\nteacher: OK right...so you mean stay calm...um yeah I guess the phrases with 'head' aren't really possible here then...let me think of one  (but continue if you like...!)\nteacher: By the way..'get my head together' - do you know that one?\nstudent: Not sure\nstudent: I've heard it but not sure about the exact meaning\nteacher: As in...'I'm all over the place/I can't concentrate/ or more generally in my life I feel out of control etc we can say e.g. I need to 'get it together' or I need to get my head together ' etc\nteacher: The negative adjective is 'untogether'\nstudent: I've heard something similar with a bad word very often\nteacher: Very common actually..as in 'he's really untogether' = disorganised etc (more formal though!)\nstudent: put you s*** together\nstudent: or get??\nteacher: Oh right yes I see! 'get your ___ together' (yes you've got it)\nstudent: yes\nstudent: so for that sentence, we use get but not put??\nteacher: More common in US that one with that extra word for some reason - but possible in UK too\nteacher: Yes only 'get'\nteacher: Same with get it together - only get\nstudent: ahh\nteacher: But i see the idea of 'put' like the parts of a machine - as in 'assemble' - Ha that's funny when I think of it like that\nteacher: Logical\nteacher: though\nstudent: yes, the verb to get is too abstract for me\nstudent: Also in Spain we use 'put' much more than you do\nteacher: yes I know what you mean .... tough aspect of English - have/get/ etc meaningless half the time !\nteacher: You use 'put ' more yeah? For example?\nstudent: we put the washing machine, we put the table, we put food on the table, ...\nteacher: Yes i see! (last one ok though in English!)\nstudent: and more that I don't remember now\nteacher: Yes sure\nteacher: Put common in English for....phrasal verbs....aaahhhh\nstudent: I think I only know put on and off\nteacher: Well these are good ones to know! Hold on a sec....(but you can continue if you like!)\nteacher: tolerate/insult or kill!/delay/ suggest/install\nteacher: can you think of a phrsal verb with put for these meanings?!  (you can use the 'logic' of the preposition as a rough guide(!)\nstudent: No idea but I'll try\nteacher: You know the 'tolerate' one right? I can't put ___ with it any more!'\nstudent: Put away=delay\nstudent: Put up=tolerate\nteacher: Yes - put up with = good\nteacher: always the 3 words\nteacher: delay = put back or put forward?\nstudent: ok\nstudent: put back I think\nteacher: Yes e.g. a meeting/also the clocks in autumn!\nstudent: I see\nteacher: the opposite = bring forward by the way\nstudent: Interesting! thanks\nteacher: insult = put up or put down?\nstudent: so we bring forward the clock??\nteacher: Ah yes good question...for the clocks we do say 'put forward' actually (nightmare sorry)\nstudent: I guess put down for insult... is put up the opposite??\nstudent: hahah English language is a great long nightmare!\nteacher: Although we often say the clocks 'go forward' (by themselves as it were) but yes: put them forward = possible/correct\nteacher: Yes! so put down for insult .... for the opposite (as in 'praise/'compliment' etc) no! put up not possible!\nstudent: ok\nteacher: Also put down - 'kill' an animal (especially a pet) because of illness etc\nteacher: YOu can't say: 'Please kill my cat!'\nteacher: Well you could I guess\nstudent: ahh also put him or her to sleep, right? I've never understood why\nteacher: And install = put ____ ?\nteacher: Ah yes you're right - good point...\nstudent: haha it sounds terrible, kill my cat!\nteacher: Put to sleep = common\nteacher: Yes ...I think a non-native student up to around upper intermediate might have to say that?!\nstudent: what do you mean with your last sentence?? sorry\nteacher: Sorry I meant if they went to the vet they might have to say 'please kill my cat'\nteacher: Because they wouldn't know any other possiblity\nstudent: I understand now thanks\nstudent: In Spanish we say 'sacrifice an animal'\nstudent: Does it work in English? We say 'we had to sacrifice our dog because of his terrible illness when he was 12'\nstudent: illness\nteacher: Oh my god - I didn't know that..no, that sounds worse then kill!\nstudent: hahah\nstudent: it's horrible I know\nteacher: I must ask a vet in a multicultural area about their experience of people asking about this!\nteacher: I would never have thought of that (sacrifice!)\nstudent: now that I think about it, it doesn't make sense...\nteacher: Emily Johnson ..have we finished the 5 verbs with 'put' ? The ones left (I think) are suggest/install\nteacher: No ..I don't see the logic!\nstudent: no idea about suggest and install!!\nstudent: sorry\nteacher: No that's ok! As in: ' Put ______ an idea/suggestion' (put in or put forward..what do you think?) and Put ____ a new alarm system (or whatever) (put in or put on..what do you think? )\nstudent: I'll try but not sure at all... Put forward an idea\nstudent: put in a new alarm\nteacher: Thanks Emily Johnson, well....choose the other option for each answer and you'll be correct!\nstudent: haha\nstudent: great I will\nstudent: Thank you very much!\nteacher: As in put forward an idea and put in an alarm system = correct! I've got a quick test for you - i'll leave it for tomorrow OK?!\nstudent: Yes!!\nstudent: I'll study all night ;)\nstudent: See you tomorrow! thanks\nteacher: OK cool - bye for now then...yes all night good!",
    "student: Good afternoon Ms. Rodriguez\nteacher: Hi there Sophia Davis - how's it going?\nstudent: yeah..I have returned to my hometown\nstudent: and the local government required me to do a second test for COVID-19\nteacher: Yes I see - you said before that weren't looking forward to that too much!\nteacher: Oh no! Another test!\nstudent: I am still negative on COVID-19\nteacher: Will this be a quick one?\nteacher: Oh right so you got a quick result\nteacher: I read that that there are basically no new cases in China now - is that right?\nstudent: but..the government informed me that I still need to quarantine at the hotel for 14 days again!!!\nstudent: or  'I still need to'\nstudent: yes,  maybe just a few people, I haven't checked the data\nstudent: so..after 14 days, I need to do that test again. after the results are all negative, I will be free\nteacher: Sorry internet went down and I lost my reply! So I;m sorry to hear that - another two weeks in a hotel... I still need = correct (need not really used in continuous form)\nstudent: I can't understand why I need to quarantine for 28 days....if I add up all the time since I left the UK, it makes 30 days, a month!! a very long time for me\nteacher: so hopefully in 2 weeks you'll finally be _______ (freedom = noun! You need the adjective here...)?\nstudent: yes..free?\nteacher: Yes I see that - it must be some kind of record - well you;ll be able to tell this story to your grandchildren!\nteacher: YEs 'free' = good!\nteacher: data' without 's' by the way.....\nstudent: yes..it is a very memorable experience.\nteacher: Yes, 'memorable' is a good word for i'm sure! One quick question Sophia Davis: What is more normal: 'I haven't checked the data.' OR 'I didn't check the data.' ??\nstudent: ok..when I am not sure whether a noun is countable or not, I always add's'\nteacher: Yes I see...well actually the word 'data' is very confusing even for English people hold on...\nstudent: in a normal way...I think that I haven't looked at the data.\nteacher: Well....do you have a specific time in mind about when you didn't check it? OR do you just really mean that you don't know the data NOW??\nteacher: And therefore it doesn't matter when you didn't check it..\nstudent: yes,, I don't know the data\nteacher: Yes exactly...so, you're not really reporting an action in the past with a specific time you see...\nteacher: it's true that not checking is in the past BUT it's connected to NOW really\nteacher: So the present perfect is the normal tense here\nstudent: so.. I haven't checked the data, because it isn't a specific time, I can't use past simple\nteacher: Yes e that's it exactly (it's not absolutely 100% rule always followed I;m afraid but basically yes that's it!) One quick test Sophia Davis: Ms. Rodriguez: 'I ___________ (lose) my glasses.' Sophia Davis: 'Oh no, do you want to help me find them?'\nstudent: if I say, 'I haven't checked the data in the morning', is it correct?\nteacher: Fill in the gap with past simple or present perfect!\nteacher: Oh sorry ...No because the morning is finished\nstudent: I have lost my glasses\nteacher: So here you do have a specific time you see? Not eaxctly like 11:17 a.m. it;s true but a definite finished period you see?\nteacher: Yes that's it good! So what I;m really saying is that I don;t have my glasses  NOW!\nstudent: so if I change 'in the morning' to 'on 07th April/ 11:17 a.m/in recent days', I can use past simple, right?\nteacher: If you say to me: 'I lost my glasses.' I care less because it feels like you;re telling me about something that is finished and maybe not important now you see\nteacher: If you say e.g. this morning/7th April 11:17 am.then YES you need the past simple!\nteacher: BUT in recent days?\nstudent: I got it!! so.. the most important thing here  is NOW I don't have the glasses, and it's having an impact on me.\nteacher: Yes that's it!\nstudent: oh!! 'in recent days' is present perfect\nstudent: like in recent years, it isn't a specific time.\nteacher: yes that's right just because in my English brain it includes time right up to now that's why\nstudent: I got it again, and it's becoming clearer to me\nteacher: it's unfinished that;s the important thing (more than the idea that;s it;s not specific)\nteacher: OK good! 'It has become more ______ in my mind.'?\nstudent: it has become clearer in my mind.\nstudent: mind\nteacher: Hold on Sophia Davis....so the idea of clearly is OK in terms of vocabulary BUT is not correct grammatically - you need to change it but just a little but!\nteacher: E.g. 'The idea is c_______ to me now.'\nstudent: the idea is clear to me now\nstudent: because we need an adjective\nteacher: Yes OK good! And the same with after the verb 'become' too\nteacher: become clear' OK?\nstudent: not ok,..because become is a verb\nteacher: I know that 'become' is a verb but you do not need an adverb (clearly) because you are not describing HOW it became clear you see? You are describing the idea - this is the thing that is clear - so you need an adjective!\nteacher: Quick test Sophia Davis...hold on a sec....\nstudent: ok\nteacher: Sorry no - my idea for the test doesn't work actually ....hold on!\nteacher: A different final test for the present perfect v past simply is on its way!\nteacher: simple\nstudent: ok, I am ready\nteacher: So .... It's your birthday and I come in the room and I say: 'Happy birthday Sophia Davis, I made/I have made you a cake!'\nteacher: What do you think?\nstudent: I have made you a cake\nstudent: no no...i made you a cake\nstudent: because the action is finished\nteacher: Aahhhh! hold on....well in both cases the cake is finished/made BUT is the result NOW important? OR...is it reporting the action in the past?\nstudent: no..I think we are talking about NOW when we have a cake which I have made for you.\nteacher: Yes OK great! So even though of course 'the making' happened in the past in a way we are focused on NOW\nteacher: That's why it's called the 'present' perfect\nteacher: OK one final final test(!): 'Video games have become/became more and more popular....' Which one is best?\nstudent: wow... I think I understand the logic of 'present'\nteacher: OK good....\nteacher: Which intro is probably best for an IELTS essay?\nstudent: Video games have become more and more popular\nstudent: because they are still popular NOW\nstudent: just because it began some time before.\nstudent: so..we use 'present' perfect\nteacher: ok cool ..yes what you are really saying is that they are popular now! good..\nstudent: I think present perfect is better in an IELTS essay.\nteacher: Often yes...because you're not writing a history essay...you're writing about a current problem\nstudent: because we are discussing a problem which has existed for a long time\nteacher: Yes\nteacher: Of course you can use the past simple sometimes with specific examples or when you use a definite past time phrase\nteacher: e.g. I was addicted to video games when I was a child\nstudent: yes.. thanks a lot.. I think I really understand this stuff, which I had never learned in any of the English classes in China.\nteacher: No problem - i;m glad it seems to make sense! You'll forget sometimes and have to relearn again a bit but you've made a good start! hey Sophia Davis remember your lovely paragraph from Monday?\nstudent: because 'when I was a child' is a specific time\nteacher: Yes exactly right\nteacher: One of the main reasons why playing video games has a negative influence on young people is that that they are addicted to them. Children do not find it easy to stop playing games whether during the day or at night, because they are so attracted by these games. As a consequence, young people don't have time to do more useful things, such as being social or reading. In my opinion, although some video games can improve concentration, children often waste their time on them.\nstudent: yes...a very long paragraph\nteacher: Do you fancy having a go at another main paragraph ? Remember your other main ideas?\nstudent: yes..\nteacher: Violence and ...aahhh i've forgotten!\nteacher: Do you remember? No worries if not...\nstudent: sorry I forgot\nteacher: No that's ok...I think the third idea was possible less good anyway!\nteacher: So if you like you can have a go at the first sentence of the 'violence' paragraph OK? I'll give you a minute....\nstudent: One of the most significant reasons why playing video games is harmful for children is that it makes them more violent.\nteacher: Just checking Sophia Davis: you mean....'one of the most significant negative effects of of children playing video games....' Right?\nstudent: yes..\nteacher: OK fine so: 'One of the most significant negative effects of children playing video games is that it  makes them more ________ (you need an adjective here!)'.\nteacher: v________' ?\nstudent: One of the most significant negative effects of playing video games on children is that it makes them more violent\nteacher: ok good adjective!\nteacher: Remember Sophia Davis in academic writing it's common to see modal verbs like 'may' or 'can' to soften our statements right?\nteacher: Because for example I guess video games don't ALWAYS make children violent?\nstudent: so, it may make them more violent.\nteacher: OK yes great!\nteacher: may' = slightly less sure maybe and 'can ' a bit more sure ok?\nteacher: So if you want to say 'can' ...you can!\nstudent: yes, ok\nstudent: but 'may' is maybe softer\nteacher: But ok fine great first sentence - clear/direct/sets up main idea effectively: e of the most significant negative effects of children playing video games is that it can make them more violent\nteacher: One of....it can make them more violent.' is good OR for example: .'....can lead to v______  beh_______'??\nstudent: can lead to violent behaviour\nteacher: yes good! Correct adjective and noun combination well done....'behaviours' possible but more normal as uncountable noun ('behaviour')\nteacher: OK see you after the break Sophia Davis ....\nstudent: ok, see you, thanks\nteacher: :)",
    "student: hi\nteacher: HI...\nstudent: I am here\nteacher: So: 'one of the most significant negative effects children playing video games is that they can lead to violent behaviour.' = good!\nteacher: ...effects of... I mean sorry\nteacher: Ready to carry on?\nstudent: so..after 'OF' we can write the whole clause with a subject, verb and object, right?\nstudent: object\nstudent: I think sometimes we write a noun after 'of'\nteacher: Well bot are possible but we use 'that' before a clause (subject + verb) so ...you can say e.g. 'The effect of smoking is cancer.'. Or e.g. The effect of smoking is that the chances of cancer are higher. 'OK?\nstudent: ok, thanks\nteacher: so the effect of x is NOUN ...OR the effect of x is that + CLAUSE (subject and verb)\nteacher: or e.g. the effect of x is ADJECTIVE (common actually)\nteacher: So for example : 'the effects of smoking are terrible.'\nstudent: I understand...thanks\nteacher: OK no problem..so ready to try the next sentence?\nstudent: yes, I am ready\nteacher: ok go for it....i'll wait....\nstudent: it is difficult for children to distinguish between the world of a game and reality.\nstudent: because some games are designed for adults to relieve stress, and sometimes they may have many violent content.\nteacher: OK thanks Sarah...I'll come back to the language here later OK? So next you're going to say that children copy the violence in some way?\nstudent: yes,,as a result of..............\nstudent: As a result of this, young people can easily copy violent behaviour, such as bullying their classmates.\nteacher: OK thanks Sarah - have you finished? Here is your paragraph - I'll give you a minute to see if you want to change anything OK? Don't worry if you can't think of anything and try not to make really big changes OK?1\nteacher: It is difficult for children to realise between games word and reality. because some games is for adults to forget pressure, and sometime it may have many violent contexts. as a result of, young people really easy to copy the violence in some ways, such as teas classmates.\nstudent: yes, that's all\nteacher: OK thanks hold on...\nteacher: OK thanks Sarah....I get the idea of your first sentence:  \u201cIt is difficult for children to realise between games word and reality.\u201d\u2026...so to make this clearer in English we have a few options ok?! One choice would be to add the words 'the difference' e.g. the difference between e.g.  \u201cIt is difficult for children to tell the difference between video games and reality.\u201d A more formal verb is \u2018distinguish\u2019 e.g. \u201cIt is difficult for children to distinguish between video games and reality\u201d. OR you could also say:  \u201cIt is difficult for children to realise that video games are not real.\u201d!\nteacher: But you can't say; ...'realise between...'\nteacher: Which one do you want to choose now?\nstudent: it is difficult for children to distinguish between video games and reality.\nteacher: OK nice! Here's your next one coming up ...can i ask you to think about your use ofsingular and plural here please? Because some games is for adults to forget pressure, and sometime it may have many violent content.\nteacher: By te way you can see I have changed contexts to 'content' - this is a good noun here ok?\nstudent: ok, I saw it...I think adult is maybe singular\nteacher: Um...'adults' is ok if you're talking about adults in general! hold on\nteacher: Your noun is 'some games' and this is fine...but what comes next? Singular or plural?\nstudent: are\nteacher: ok good\nteacher: and the next word you have to change to the plural??\nteacher: Again it connects back to 'some games'\nteacher: a tiny little word...!\nteacher: You OK Sarah?\nteacher: OK sorry - I'll help!\nteacher: you need to change 'it' to  'they'\nteacher: Oh maybe you're having internet issues?!\nstudent: sorry..\nstudent: so...because some games are designed for adults to relieve stress and  they may have violent content.\nteacher: OK good ...thanks Sarah ...small grammar changes it's true but I want you to get into the habit of seeing these mistakes so you change them (and eventually not make them in the first place!)\nstudent: yes, I will make a habit of it, thanks\nteacher: Ok so your last sentence was: 'As a result of, young people really easy to copy the violence in some ways, such as teas classmates.' What does 'teas' mean here??\nteacher: Ah sorry i get it now !\nteacher: You mean the verb 'tease' right?\nstudent: I think the meaning here is that they fight with other students who are not as strong in class.\nteacher: Yes ok ok ...maybe 'bully' is a good verb here - do you know that word?\nstudent: no... but I'll learn it now\nteacher: OK fine...yes  so e.g. 'Some children bully others.' 'Some children are bullies.' (noun for person)\nteacher: Some children are bullied at school  = passive\nteacher: And finally ....the name of the problem = bullying ....so.....bullying is a serious problem in some schools\nteacher: OK?!\nstudent: yes, so...as a result bullying is a serious problem in some schools\nteacher: Yes ok good! check for singular/plural mistakes Sarah if you can please!!\nstudent: schools!!\nstudent: as a result, bullying is a serious problem in some schools.\nteacher: OK good wel ldone\nteacher: Ok Sarah \u2026the bit in CAPITAL letters needs changing OK? \u201cAs a result, young people REALLY EASY TO copy the violence in some ways, and bullying is a serious problem in some schools.\u201d\nteacher: This is a structure you have used before and we need to get this right!\nteacher: If you're not sure of an idea of how to change it tell me and we'll do it together OK?\nstudent: I am not sure...\nteacher: That's OK! Hold on...\nteacher: So for example we could use lots of possible phrases to explain the connection between seeing the violence and copying it ok?\nstudent: ok'\nteacher: One question: If I roll two dice the chances of me getting a double six are _______? Any ideas for the adjective?\nteacher: Don't worry if not! Just tell me...\nteacher: High or low?\nstudent: impossible\nstudent: low\nteacher: OK thanks!\nteacher: So another way of saying this could be: 'It is very _______ that you will get a double six.'?\nteacher: unl_ _ _ _ _ _ '??\nstudent: unl....\nteacher: unlikely!\nteacher: So if children play violent video games they are _______ to copy the behaviour they see.'\nteacher: Likely or unlikely?\nstudent: wow..\nstudent: it is very unlikely that you will get a double six\nstudent: sorry.....\nteacher: OK yes good! and the next example? That's ok!\nstudent: likely\nteacher: OK good ...so this is one way you can explain that connection OK? INstead of using 'easy'\nstudent: yes, it becomes more academic\nteacher: OK fine....Sarah I'll copy the final complete paragraph and we can give it a final review tomorrow OK?  Thanks for your concentration and hard work today!\nteacher: Enjoy your hotel (sorry!)\nstudent: yes..thank you very much.\nteacher: OK thanks bye for now\nstudent: see you tomorrow.",
    "teacher: Hi there Emma Smith...\nstudent: Hi Mrs. Thompson\nteacher: Everything OK?\nstudent: How are you doing today?? less mad?\nteacher: Um..yes I think so! I'll try and be a bit more upbeat today and avoid coming across like i;m off my head\nteacher: Which of course I'm not\nstudent: Good plan! Is it working?\nteacher: Oooops - yes so far - I've had a strict timetable of sane productive activities\nstudent: I think that works very well (having a structure I mean)\nteacher: Yes..do you try to have one?\nstudent: Yes, I try to be organised but in my plan there are productive activities and non-productive activities for example lying in the sun is one of my daily activities (is 'lying' correct?)\nstudent: organised\nstudent: My balcony gets the sun for just a few hours a day so I try to make sure I go out on time!\nteacher: Right I see ...ooh I'm a bit jealous of that one (though it is sunny right now actually) ..lying IN the sun...Yes lying = good (or e.g. sunbathing on my balcony)\nteacher: You have to say 'my balcony gets the sun' not the sun gets...by the way\nteacher: Otherwise it makes think of the sun climbing up your building\nstudent: I guess you could sunbathe in your boat all day (if it is sunny) much more comfortably than I do\nstudent: I see haha IN\nteacher: Yes true ...out on the deck\nteacher: By the way this reminds me of a programme I watched last night from Spanish TV (indirectly inspired by communicating with you I think \u2013 it keeps the idea/existence of Spain in my head!) that I\u2019ll translate as \u2018Quarantine Diaries\u2019 to stay in English \u2026 actually after having boasted to you about how I could understand Spanish stand-up etc I realise how rusty I\u2019m getting, even with comprehension let alone with speaking\u2026\nteacher: HAve you seen it? Sorry if i interrupted you writing something longer...\nteacher: Keep going if you like..\nstudent: No, I was waiting for you to write something... No problem\nstudent: I didn't watch it... Did you like it??\nstudent: I heard a politician criticising the idea of making a funny programme about such a dramatic situation (what would you call a programme like that, a comedy??)\nteacher: Well the bits I followed were funny in places...I can never work out whether it is lways les funny because of the language processing or the cultural differences you know?\nteacher: sorry always less i mean\nstudent: I see\nteacher: yes hol don\nteacher: So just checking ...does dramatic mean 'bad'/serious in your head /Spanish?\nstudent: Yes\nstudent: situaci\u00f3n dram\u00e1tica en espa\u00f1ol\nstudent: I guess it is different in English\nteacher: YEs thought so...yes it's a bot of a false friend reallly..\nstudent: I love false friends!!\nteacher: as it doesn't exactly automatically mean bad\nteacher: yes they're interesting i know\nteacher: basically here you'd say 'serious' situation\nteacher: or worrying etc\nteacher: terrible!\nstudent: I understand\nteacher: etc\nteacher: Do you know the phrase 'make light of'\nstudent: when would you use dramatic then??\nstudent: no, I don't know that phrase\nteacher: That's what the politician was criticising : somebody making light of such a serious thing\nteacher: treating it as a joke basically as you can imagine\nstudent: I see\nstudent: and was the programme like that??\nteacher: Um..so 'dramatic' = relating to drama e.g. a dramatic pause doesn't mean anything bad just something big is going to happen (maybe something exciting!)\nteacher: Or of course just BIG as in a dramatic increase/decrease ...but again could be something positive or neagtive\nstudent: I see the difference!\nteacher: As in a dramatic increase in survival (not possible in Spanish I guess? )\nteacher: And sorry yes..the programme was definitely taking the piss (affectionately) out of people's dysfunctional responses to being stuck inside\nstudent: I see... there are so many jokes about that on social networks... (correct?) and I think if you or your loved ones are ill or dead, it must be painful to see everyone taking the piss out of the situation\nteacher: E.g. family tension/argument between couples/trying to work from home/old people not understanding Skype etc (very similar to UK examples! - Actually I don't know if there's a similar programme in the uK (i don't have normal TV) but it could work with British black humour etc)  If i was TV producer I'd copy it!\nteacher: Ah I feel bad now having just seen your comment!\nteacher: Of course ...I guess it must be difficult for people who've really been affected - much to close to the bone at this stage\nstudent: noo, don't feel bad but I don't know why we make so many jokes... I think it's a way of surviving at home all day\nteacher: Yes on social network = good (on social media also common ..maybe a bit more common i'd say) ...yes the humour thing is definitely a survival strategy ...black humour/sarcasm is my default mode i'm afraid\nstudent: Do you do the same in England? Jokes, memes, videos....\nteacher: Yes ...all very common here too ..i got sent (a stupid one) one today revealing 'zoom' as the hidden baddie behind the virus (like in SCooby Doo) which made me chuckle for a second\nstudent: that's interesting, I thought it was a Spanish thing\nstudent: I said that I think it must hurt but I laugh a lot!\nteacher: OK! I feel a bit less bad now...\nstudent: hahaha\nteacher: Hey Emma Smith can i give you a quick phrasal verb test from yesterday?\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: ok here goes: 1. I\u2019m having a new kitchen __________ at the weekend. 2. I don\u2019t know how you _________ your noisy neighbours. 3. He\u2019s a terrible boss. He\u2019s always __________ his employees.  4. The government has ___________ the idea of lifting the lockdown next month. 5. The date for completing the new rail link has been ___________ 6 months due to coronavirus.\nteacher: sorry number 4 should be: ...'until next month'\nstudent: 6 put back\nteacher: Aahhhhh! no forget that...it's fine as it is\nteacher: Yes number 5 correct!\nstudent: 1 put in?? can you install a kitchen??\nteacher: yes absolutely (not in Spanish I guess!)\nstudent: nooo\nteacher: fit' would be common here to actually\nteacher: maybe a bit  more normal\nteacher: that's probably new to you too right?\nteacher: So the job is: 'a kitchen fitter'!\nstudent: ok. We would say 'put' poner una cocina. Yes 'fit' for a kitchen is new too.\nteacher: And the advert: 'we'll your fit your kitchen for a low price blah balah\nstudent: 2.put up\nteacher: Yes 2 good...always followed by 'with' remember!\nstudent: ohh yes!! sorry\nstudent: 3. He\u2019s a terrible boss. He\u2019s always __________ his employees. 4. The government has ___________ the idea of lifting the lockdown next month.\nstudent: I copied to be able to see it, sorry\nteacher: no probs\nstudent: 3.putting down\nstudent: 4. put forward\nteacher: OK great yes\nteacher: You know a common experience Emma Smith taht maybe you have as a language teacher is when you cover something in a lesson you hear/see it everywhere on the same day you know what i mean?\nteacher: I swear I've heard about 100 phrasal verbs with put since yesterday !\nstudent: haha that's funny!\nstudent: I don't get that because I don't teach Spanish...\nteacher: No of course - I see..\nstudent: But when I watch series in English I pay more attention in case there is something we've practised recently...\nstudent: By the way, have you watched the Spanish series 'La casa de papel'? It's very popular here\nteacher: yes good that's the key right? It's called 'noticing' in language teaching (not a very technical term i know!)\nteacher: Ah no I haven't heard of that but I'll look out for it\nstudent: It's on Netflix\nteacher: I don't normally watch Spanish TV by the way - it's only because we recently upgraded the tech on our boat (due to having work from home)\nteacher: so I can now get a good enough signal to constantly stream unlimited data\nstudent: I understand!\nstudent: And where do you watch Spanish programmes??\nstudent: rtve.es??\nteacher: it has its pros and cons - we'd kind of shielded ourselves (and our daughter) a bit from the onslaught of the internet etc\nteacher: Yes that's it rtve\nteacher: I can't seem to get LA 2 to work though only LA 1 which is annoying\nstudent: It's great, especially now there are a lot of films on\nteacher: yes are they still dubbed (the English language ones?)\nstudent: Yes, always!! :( But the ones that are on because of the quarantine are all popular Spanish films\nstudent: do you say 'dubbed'? I thought it was doubled\nteacher: OK I might give them a go then...you know that's one thing that's been revolutionized by the internet of course - kids all over the world watch more stuff in English\nteacher: Ah really? No 'dubbed' is correct!\nstudent: sure!!\nstudent: and the verb is to dub??\nteacher: so ....to dub a film into Spanish ...but obviously common in the passive\nstudent: good\nteacher: and 'dubbing' as the noun\nteacher: yes so i've seen the average english level go up a lot in my time as a teacher\nteacher: especially with listening and speaking skills\nstudent: That's great!\nteacher: By the way Emma Smith a small thing: you're writing 'especially' without the initial 'e' which is certainly possible and can sound like this (and be this too) but NOT standard to see it like this\nstudent: ok\nstudent: thanks! especially then\nteacher: Yes it is good ..so for example we get loads of kids from Brazil/Argentina in the winter (their summer holidays) and a lot of them are virtually bilingual (cos of Netflix etc)\nteacher: Just to be clear after the especially thing :I'm writing 'cos' out of sheer laziness and this is only normally for texts etc ok?\nstudent: yes I know about Argentina, I have friends there and they always watch things in original version! Good for them :)\nstudent: we are terrible for that in Spain\nteacher: yes..a bit of TV is almost enough for kids! I'm jealous .... yes it's a shame about Spain...\nstudent: Ok about 'cos'. Thanks\nteacher: ok!\nteacher: So yes the format dictates the content doesn't it? I've succumbed to text speak on this site!\nteacher: A bit anyway\nstudent: Sorry, I don't understand what you mean\nstudent: I think you mean that because we are typing you use normal things like 'cos'\nteacher: Sorry I mean that because I'm using this format to communicate with you I have started writing - yes you're right!\nteacher: THat's all i meant\nteacher: I don't normally write loads of texts you see..i'm old really\nstudent: I see, it's normal\nteacher: Yes but i'm not suited to this type of communication - I always find myself deleting huge blocks of text because i'm just waffling (by text message standards anyway)\nstudent: No, you are not old. Do you know the old Spanish expression 'vieja es la ropa'?\nteacher: No i don't know that  - and i Can't work it out either!\nstudent: it means 'clothes are old'. We use it when someone says that they are old\nstudent: trying to say that old is not an adjective for people... it's a joke.\nteacher: ah I see ( i think) you mean the person inside isn't?\nteacher: Oh ok I see...\nstudent: I guess...\nstudent: Something like 'people don't get older, they get wiser'\nteacher: Yes I see....in English you'd stress the word CLOTHES to get same effect I guess as we're less flexible with word order\nstudent: Not always though...\nteacher: Yes i'm not sure if i'm wiser! no probably i am...\nstudent: What do you mean by 'stress the word clothes'??\nstudent: Ohh it's time... If you want we can continue tomorrow\nteacher: I mean in speech (longer and louder) OK yes cheers Emma Smith - speak to you tomorrow ..hang in there....\nstudent: Ahh I understand! thank you very much\nteacher: all right bye!\nstudent: See you tomorrow!",
    "student: Good afternoon Ms. Rodriguez\nteacher: Hi Amelia - how are you?\nstudent: Today is the second day of my new quarantine.\nstudent: I suppose I'm used to living in isolation because my schedule is like in the previous 14 days.\nteacher: Yes I guess you must be used to it by now! Is there anything different about where you are now compared to before?\nstudent: no!! maybe it is just living in different hotels.\nstudent: But sometimes I really want to go for a run.\nteacher: Right I see...yes I'd really like to go for a run too. I normally run a lot but I have a knee injury at the moment. Ironically, I'd be stuck inside anyway even without this virus!\nteacher: So you just have to stay in a room all day?\nteacher: How do you get your meals?\nstudent: yes, I know you said it before.\nstudent: without a doubt, it will be my most memorable 28 days,\nteacher: Yes,,you'll look back on it with nostalgia ....\nstudent: every day nurses give me normal meals.\nteacher: the nurses give you normal meals yeah? Do they wear full protective equipment?\nstudent: But they are all different. Yes!!! They all wear full protective equipment.\nstudent: and I am required to take my body temperature twice a day.\nteacher: It must be like something out of a movie!? Sorry Amelia but: 'they all wearing full protective equipment.' Happy with this??\nstudent: when I first was in a hospital for a day, I thought everything was 100%  like out of a movie.\nteacher: Yes I can imagine!\nstudent: yes....I was happy with that because I was far away from my parents...haha\nteacher: Oh right I see! But what I meant was: are you happy with the grammar in English of your sentence??!! 'they all wearing full protective equipment.'\nstudent: maybe I need to use present perfect\nteacher: Ah ...well if you're talking about right now then the present continuous is OK but have you used it correctly here?\nteacher: THis is the same mistake you made before (that's why I'm asking you again!)\nstudent: no..I think I'm talking about a period of time.\nteacher: OK Amelia ...hold on\nteacher: Don't worry about changing the tense...it's not the problem here\nteacher: You can use the presnent continuous but you have to make it correctly!\nteacher: With two words remember!!\nstudent: yes!!\nteacher: They _____ wearing ...'?\nstudent: they are  wearing\nteacher: Yes ok good thanks!\nstudent: I think I need to punish myself.\nteacher: You could also use present simple here: 'They all wear protective ...' = correct too\nstudent: I always forget it\nteacher: Yes don't worry ...it's normal ..not only you! 2 steps forward one step back ..it's normal!\nteacher: Amelia let me give you your paragraph from yesterday....\nteacher: One of the most significant negative effects of playing video games is that they can lead to violent behaviour. It is difficult for children to distinguish between video games and reality. Because many games are designed for adults, they may often contain violent content. As a result, young people are likely to copy the violence they see, and this can result in them bullying classmates for example.\nstudent: yes.. I learn a new word of 'copy' is 'imitate'\nteacher: Yes that's a very good idea! You could definitely use it here\nteacher: This is quite good in many ways...but I wonder: there are 4 sentences here. Can you put them in a different order so the paragraph is a bit more logical? You only have to change one sentence (I mean put it in a different place) Which one ?\nteacher: 1,2,3, or 4?\nteacher: Don't worry if you're not sure...\nstudent: apply 2 to 1\nteacher: So hold on..you mean the first sentence should be different?\nteacher: I like that first sentence!!\nstudent: ok..I am not sure\nteacher: No problem...well for me Amelia changing round 2 and 3 seems a bit better\nteacher: So...One of the most significant negative effects of playing video games is that they can lead to violent behaviour. Because many games are designed for adults, they may often contain violent content. It is difficult for children to distinguish between video games and reality. As a result, young people are likely to copy the violence they see, and this can result in them bullying classmates for example.\nteacher: So the 'as a result' directly follows the fact that they can't tell it isn't real do you see?\nstudent: yes.. I see it\nteacher: OK cool ...\nstudent: it becomes more logical 1. topic sentence 2. an explanation of the main idea 3. consequence\nteacher: Yes i think so\nteacher: But don't worry too much ..i think your priority Amelia is still gettgin the language right ...your understanding of paragraph/essay structure is pretty good i think\nstudent: so..this structure is normal and academic in English writing, right?\nteacher: Yes absolutely - it's fine\nstudent: I like it\nteacher: Ok Amelia - can i give you a choice..do you want to try answering some part 3 speaking questions or would you prefer trying another paragraph (on a different topic)\nstudent: I'd prefer to try another paragraph\nteacher: OK fine...hold on a sec (by the way, you can suggest a topic if you want to practise a particular one..if not i'll choose for you!)\nstudent: I don't have any ideas.....\nteacher: OK no probs hold on\nstudent: ok\nteacher: In some countries people prefer renting their homes to buying them. What are the advantages and disadvantages of renting?\nteacher: OK make sense? Give me a couple of main ideas just with basic keywords if you like...i'll give you a minute OK?\nstudent: 1. cheaper  2.easy to move 3. good houses are expensive to rent, but it is still cheaper than buying a normal house\nstudent: and a disadvantage is\nteacher: OK yes understood thanks...ok i'll wait!\nstudent: 1. you can't buy big and expensive furniture   2. sometimes it doesn't feel like home.\nteacher: OK thanks Amelia! Can i just check your first disadvantage? The 'furniture' one? What do you mean here?\nstudent: like... tables, beds, refrigerator ......\nteacher: Ok yes I understand what furniture means! (not a fridge by the way) ...but why can't you buy a large table for example if you;re renting?\nstudent: because when you move to another city or place, it is very inconvenient to move them.\nteacher: Ah ok I'm with you! Yes of course (just checking though because you'll have to explain this if you use it as a main idea right?) Quick question: 'it is very unconvenience ' What kind of word do you need after 'very'? (noun/verb/adjective?\nstudent: adjective I think..\nteacher: OK good yes! Can you change your word to an adjective?\nteacher: incon_ _ _ _ _ _ _ '\nstudent: very inconvenient\nteacher: Hold on Amelia....'importance' = adjective or noun?\nstudent: noun\nstudent: because important is an adjective.\nteacher: OK good! Can you apply this rule to your two words from just before?\nteacher: So 'inconvenience' = Noun/adjective?\nstudent: is a noun\nteacher: OK good..and the adjective you need is?\nstudent: inconvenient\nteacher: OK good!\nteacher: So Amelia ...getting verb tenses and getting nouns/verb/adjective forms right are two big things you can improve for a better score ok?\nstudent: ok,thanks\nteacher: Quick test coming up OK? Choose the right option for each sentence : We need silence/silent in the room please. It\u2019s difficult to tell the difference/different between twins. Lung cancer is a common consequence/consequent of smoking.\nstudent: silent/difference/consequence\nteacher: THanks Amelia...you need to change one of your answers! Which one?\nstudent: slience\nteacher: Yes ok good!\nteacher: You need 'something' right (a noun in other words) .... you can say need TO + verb\nstudent: need to be silent\nstudent: silent\nteacher: Ah well.....need to + verb so....where's the verb in your last example??\nteacher: You would need to add one! 'We need to ____ silent now.'??\nstudent: we need to be silent now.\nteacher: OK good! good to focus on this stuff! OK Amelia speak to you after the break..bye for now...\nstudent: ok, bye ...see you",
    "teacher: Hi there...\nstudent: hi\nteacher: Right Tiffany Smith - Would you like to try beginning of a main paragraph for the essay question?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Choose an advantage of renting  and go for it!\nteacher: How about the financial one you mentioned?\nstudent: yes, that's ok\nteacher: OK fine...I'll wait\nstudent: one positive aspect of renting a home is that it is easy to rent a good house and it would still be cheaper than buying a normal one.\nteacher: OK got that thanks...keep going when you're ready...\nstudent: House prices are sky-high in many well-known urban areas because they are financial and political centres. For people who live there, renting is one of the best ways to save money.\nteacher: OK! A big juicy one there....I'll start working on this one if you can continue on the next one (last sentence if you like)\nstudent: maybe I can add a name of the city such as London\nstudent: ok\nstudent: in addition, young professionals often do not have the amount of money to buy a house to have a career in those cities.\nteacher: Thanks Tiffany Smith hold on a sec\nstudent: in other word, renting can make it easy to live in such expensive cities\nstudent: ok,  I am finished.\nstudent: I have finished.\nteacher: Yep thanks...here's your paragraph then: 'One positive aspect of renting home is that it is easy to rent a high quality house and even cheaper than buy a normal one. The house prices are sky-high in many well-known urban areas, because they are always the financial or policy centre. For people who are living there, renting is one of the best way to saving money. In addition, for young working people, they don't have amount of money to buy a house for careers in those cities.'\nteacher: Not bad! Can i ask you switch one sentence to a different place??\nteacher: So again you have 4 sentences. Which one would you move? 1,2,3, or 4?\nstudent: move 2\nteacher: To where?\nstudent: before  because...\nstudent: I am not sure about the logic here.\nteacher: In my English brain Tiffany Smith the most logical is: 1. It's cheaper to rent. 2. House prices are sky high. 3. YOung people can't afford to buy. 4. Therefore renting is the only option/a good way to save money.\nteacher: IN other words, change 3 and 4\nteacher: What do you think?\nstudent: yes.. I agree with it.\nstudent: it make the logic clearer\nteacher: OK....anyway lots of good stuff in your paragraph Tiffany Smith ...for example:\nteacher: \u201cone positive aspect of renting a home is that\u201d = good topic sentence chunk! \u2026.\u201cit is easy to rent\u201d = good correct structure with to + infinitive!....  \u201ca high quality house\u201d = nice adjective to use instead of just \u2018good\u2019 !\nteacher: Two small things though to change...: \u201cone positive aspect of renting ____ home is that it is easy to rent a high quality house\u2026\u201d OK?\nteacher: Missing word?\nstudent: yes. I studied the topic sentence  when you were teaching us in class.\nstudent: a\nteacher: OK thanks great..one more...: \u201c\u2026and even cheaper than _____ a normal one\u201d. What kind of word do you need in the gap? Noun or verb?\nstudent: buy\nstudent: verb\nteacher: So for example: 'Water is cheaper than whisky.' Correct?\nteacher: So what comes after 'than' if you comparing things normally?\nteacher: if you ARE comparing things (sorry)\nteacher: I made the mistake you make by accident when typing quickly!\nstudent: haha.. I can understand, because I always make mistakes in spelling.\nteacher: :) Whisky = noun right? So: \u201c\u2026and even cheaper than _____ a normal one\u201d. What kind of word do you need in the gap? Noun or verb?\nstudent: I think it might be water is cheaper than buying whisky.\nstudent: ..and even cheaper than buying a normal one.\nteacher: OK great!\nteacher: OK so your next sentence had some great stuff in it\u2026Good words/phrases = sky-high/urban areas/financial centre/people who are living there/\nteacher: Nice!\nstudent: yes..thanks\nteacher: One question: Policy centre? How do you mean? Where the government is based? Connected to politics? What\u2019s the adjective? Politics is the noun\u2026\nteacher: And 'policy' is also a noun by the way\nstudent: yes..maybe it is the capital of one country.\nteacher: OK well...'political' is the adjective...so financial and political centre is grammatically correct anyway\nstudent: I don't know the noun.\nteacher: One more: \u201cOne of the best ____ \u201c(singular or plural noun next)?\nstudent: plural\nteacher: Sorry you mean you didn't know the word policy was a noun?\nstudent: ways\nteacher: Yes good!\nstudent: yes.. but I've learned just now it's political.\nteacher: Yes sorry Tiffany Smith just to be clear - you know the word  policy means 'plan' right?\nteacher: But a specific plan (that a government of company/organisation has)\nstudent: yes..many ways to solve problems\nstudent: ways\nteacher: Yes good! So actually a useful word for IELTS\nteacher: So for example: the government should change its energy policy and stop relying on fossil fuels...'\nteacher: or: 'Most schools nowadays have clear anti-bullying policies...' OK?!\nstudent: so..this is a plan\nteacher: Yes like a plan or a at least an agreed way of responding to a situation\nstudent: I got it\nteacher: OK finally for this sentence: One of the best ways to ______ verb or noun next?\nstudent: verb\nstudent: like one of the best ways to solve this problem.\nstudent: waysssssssss\nteacher: OK great! So remember the two little changes you need here?! : 'For people who are living there, renting is one of the best way to saving money.'\nstudent: I can't get rid of this mistake.\nstudent: so....after 'to' we can use ....ing?\nteacher: No! this was your original! But you need to change it as you just suggested...\nteacher: So: 'For people who are living there, renting is one of the best wayS to SAVE money.'  = good!\nstudent: ok...For people who live there, renting is one of the best ways to save money.'\nteacher: Yes exactly good!\nteacher: OK last sentence: Can you change this bit: \u201cthey don't have amount of money to buy\u201d to this by adding just one word:   = they don't have _______ money to buy\nstudent: they don't have enough money to buy.\nteacher: Yes ok good\nteacher: Or maybe: 'They can't ______ to live there.'?\nstudent: they cannot afford to live there.\nteacher: you mean 'afford' right?!\nstudent: yes..afford\nteacher: ok! So if you can't afford something then thing is 'unaff_ _ _ _ _ _ '??\nteacher: do you know this adjective?\nteacher: it ends in '-able'!\nstudent: unaffordable\nteacher: ok great\nstudent: it is unaffordable for young people to live there.\nteacher: OK Tiffany Smith - here's your paragraph with our changes OK? (plus a couple more little ones I've put in sorry!) One positive aspect of renting a home is that it is easy to rent a high quality house and even cheaper than buying a normal one. House prices are sky-high in many well-known urban areas, because they are always the financial or political centre. Young working people don't have enough money to buy a house for careers in those cities. Consequently, for people who are living there, renting is one of the best ways to save money.\nteacher: Pretty good overall!\nstudent: thanks..\nstudent: I hope one day I can write easily like this without mistakes and logic problems.\nteacher: Yes you're on the right track just keep going! Can i suggest the following words might be useful for a paragraph/topic like this: property'temporary/short-term/unaffordable/housing market /\nstudent: yes !!\nstudent: I have added these to my vocabulary\nteacher: especially 'property' actually\nteacher: OK great use of present perfect (i've added them)\nstudent: it might mean wealth I guess\nteacher: Ah! property is just another word for e.g. buildings/houses/flats etc\nstudent: and including houses and other things\nteacher: Actually 'accommodation' would be good here too maybe right?\nstudent: ok...thanks\nteacher: AND your use of wealth is interesting\nteacher: You could definitely include that somehow!\nteacher: or similar words...wealth = adjective or noun?\nteacher: OK Tiffany Smith I have to go now I'm afraid - I van see you're having internet problems! I'll speak to you tomorrow..bye!\nstudent: ok\nteacher: ok cheers bye\nstudent: see you m thanks a lot\nstudent: cheers",
    "teacher: Hi there Emily...\nstudent: Hi Mr. Thompson\nstudent: How is it going?\nteacher: Yeah fine thanks... I've been doing yoga today\nstudent: Very good! Do you usually do yoga?\nteacher: No! I'm not the right sort of person - the stuff I normally do is basically high intensity\nstudent: I see\nteacher: Yes...I'm too impatient for yoga but here we are...\nteacher: I guess I will need to calm down at some point - I need to change my personality and accept the inevitability of yoga as main form of exercise going forward!\nstudent: haha before I tried yoga I thought it was too slow and relaxing... when I went to my first class I suffered so much that it completely changed my idea of it\nteacher: Ultimately it will make a happier person\nteacher: Yes I see..No, I know it's not 'easy' in that sense\nteacher: I'm exaggerating a bit ...some of the core exercise stuff i do is kind of similar really....\nteacher: Maybe without so much focus on the 'breathing' etc\nstudent: Yes, I undestand... once you've tried yoga, you realise that many of the exercises you do in other sports (correct?) are similar or the same\nteacher: Yes correct (well, 'many of THE exercises you do in other sports are...') Can I ask you Emily: in the following sentence can you use the verb suffer in the present informally?  when I went to my first class I suffer so much that I completely changed my idea about it\nstudent: maybe better 'many exercises you do when you practise other sports'...\nteacher: Oh i see! NO no 'do' is what you need! hold on\nteacher: so 'practise'  - the main meaning is to do something repeatedly to get better right?\nstudent: I see\nstudent: (en espa\u00f1ol decimos 'practicar deporte')\nteacher: Yes I understand So e.g. If an English person says I practise football' do they mean i play football\nteacher: ?\nstudent: no, I think that means that you repeat something you want to improve?\nstudent: something to do with football\nteacher: In fact that's a terrible example really because basically we never say 'practise football' .... yes exactly to your last comment! So we could say I practise penalties (e.g. you take 100 again and again you see?\nstudent: yes I see\nstudent: what about 'suffer'? By the way is it suffer or sufer??\nteacher: And for music? If you 'practise' the guitar' it means you play the same piece of music again and again - in fact again we usually say I'm going to practise this piece etcy\nteacher: suffer!\nteacher: So i just wondered: You wrote the word 'suffer' in the present before and I was curious if that was just a slip as it were or whether you were kind of saying it deliberately you know?\nstudent: ok\nteacher: THe verb is OK - i meant the tense\nteacher: when I went to my first class I suffer so much that I completely changed my idea about it\nstudent: I suffered a lot when I went to the first class\nstudent: sorry\nstudent: simple past\nstudent: right?\nteacher: No that's ok! But would it be OK to say all of this in the present in Spanish?\nteacher: Yes you're right! Past simple is correct\nstudent: No, it woudn't be alright in Spanish either\nstudent: Yo sufr\u00ed mucho cuando fui a la primera clase\nteacher: informally you hear people say e.g. So I go to the yoga class and it's so hard etc\nteacher: But i had the feeling it was more common in Spanish ..but maybe not from what you're sugegsting\nstudent: informally you hear people say e.g. So I go to the yoga class and it's so hard etc/ Do these people mean that they go every day or every week and suffer?\nteacher: By the way, the structure:  'I changed my idea' is a bit weird...normal - e.g. it (the experience) changed my idea\nstudent: Would 'I changed my mind' sound better??\nteacher: Ah well that would be normal in that meaning but no - i mean to describe a specific past situation\nteacher: when telling a story for example\nteacher: So i go into the bar and this guy comes up to me and says etc etc yousee?\nstudent: yes, it could happen in Spanish!! when you tell a story you can use the present\nteacher: Yes good -  'i changed my mind'= also normal\nteacher: OK right yes - i thought so ( i had a feeling it was not always that informal in Spanish like it is in English really but that's OK - I;m getting too picky about it!)\nstudent: But it would't be correct (the use of present) to talk about a habit in the past, just to talk about an event (like I go to the bar and the guy tells me '....')\nteacher: Yes same in English\nstudent: I see!\nstudent: Thanks\nteacher: They're quite similar really!\nstudent: Yes, luckily!!\nteacher: OK...Hey Emily I went to Waitrose this morning and it reminded me of our conversation about supermarkets and being posh...\nstudent: haha did you see a lot of posh people buying caviar?\nteacher: Well i definitely saw some posh people! I was looking at a website with a student the other say called: 'things overheard in Waitrose..'\nteacher: the other day i mean\nteacher: I was thinking I'd show you some extracts ...\nstudent: that's fun\nstudent: Yes please!\nstudent: Do people go to supermarkets to hear what people say?? haha\nteacher: Ha! well  i guess it;s the main way (apart from clothes etc) to tell if they're posh (accent and vocabulary etc) Randon example coming up..can you spot the two things that signal poshness? Overheard in Waitrose: Sebastian stop hitting your sister, or you won't get any Brioche!\nstudent: Brioche instead of chocolate sounds posh to me\nstudent: or sausages\nstudent: haha\nteacher: Yes definitely - a clear sign  of a middle class child! Also the name 'Sebastian' is a bit posh too!\nstudent: I can't see the second one!\nteacher: Going back to our conversation about names you see\nstudent: ahh ok... I didn't know that name before I went to England... there I met at least 3 SebastiEns from France... One was really posh but the others were not, so I didn't think it was a posh name\nteacher: Ah right yes i see - yes, I don't know if it's posh in France actually but a bit in the uK ...One more (with two indications again) : 'Why do you always have coffee in Waitrose? I have you darling, that's why Mummy needs coffee.'\nstudent: Ohh I don't understand this one... is it a couple talking?\nteacher: Oh sorry ...a child and parent\nstudent: so mummy needs coffee because the child is a pain\nstudent: ??\nteacher: Yes that's the idea/meaning\nstudent: Maybe darling and Mummy are the indications of poshness?? not sure\nteacher: But...the reason it's funny (not that funny I admit) is because 'darling and 'Mummy' are posh...yes you;ve got it!\nteacher: Yes so most kids stop saying mummy and daddy after a bit\nteacher: but for some reason posh kids carry on (into adulthood)\nstudent: difficult if you are not English because as a foreigner I don't really see why mummy and darling are the indications of poshness..\nteacher: Just to be clear, i'm absolutely not judging this negatively by the way!!\nstudent: No, don't worry! I really like the sentences, I think it's a fun activity!\nteacher: No sure, it's all a bit arbitrary of course - i guess it might kind of be realted to posh kids being more spoiled by their parents (and being treated like babies , hence the babyish names) but this feels quite simplistic !\nteacher: As in, that;s a massive stereotype that's often not true (about them being spoiled..)\nteacher: OK one more then: \u2018Daddy does lego have a silent \u2018T\u2019, like merlot?\u2019\nstudent: good one! we pronounce that T in Spanish (of course)\nteacher: I guess this one is kind of obvious really!\nteacher: Ah yes of course you would wouldn't you - I won't laugh...\nstudent: yes, daddy and merlot, and a child caring about silent letters...\nstudent: Do you have the same about other supermarkets??\nstudent: I would like to see some sentences overheard in Asda!\nteacher: yes that's it...But actually of course pronouncing various French words/phrases (e.g. croissant = common example) in a more 'french' way is a sign of being higher up the class ladder\nteacher: or just pretentious of course\nstudent: Same in Spanish\nteacher: Yes i can imagine...You know Emily that my daughter for example says 'chorizo' with correct Spanish pronunciation NOt like the standard English choritzo or whatever\nstudent: the sad thing is that also if you pronounce spiderman correctly in Spain you sound pretentious too :(\nteacher: So she could be put on the website!\nteacher: Yes the ASDA ones would be interesting in their own way too of course\nstudent: haha Sure, she says chorizo and she goes to Waitrose\nteacher: Yes 'fraid so...ha! i've found an Asda one online! First example: 'Oi Dad, get us some fags! Forget my fake ID.'\nteacher: forgot i mean\nteacher: Do you get it?\nstudent: Noo I don't\nstudent: yess\nstudent: I knew you told me the meaning of fag before, I just checked!!\nstudent: Very funny and terrible at the same time\nteacher: Well 1. 'oi' = working class 2. 'us' for 'me' = same 3. fags = OK you've got it i see!\nstudent: What does 'Oi' mean? something like 'hey'\nteacher: Yes exactly\nteacher: a direct (rude for some) way of getting attention\nstudent: how do you pronounce it?\nteacher: oy'\nstudent: like today in Spanish? weird\nteacher: yes true - i hadn't thought of that!\nteacher: Oi Emily one more: Another post about an aubergine sees a boy ask his mum if the vegetable is a cucumber, to which she answers: 'No, it\u2019s a courgette dumb s***.'\nstudent: hahahaha\nstudent: Terribleeee!!\nstudent: More from Asda, please!\nteacher: yes,,,,i can add to this that if you go in e.g. Tesco/Asda and buy an aubergine the checkout assistant sometimes doesn't know which button to press in the till for the price\nstudent: hahaha sorry, I should't laugh\nteacher: Chantelle put that f****** vodka back you already got a bottle for ya 16th birthday last week!!'\nstudent: I had an experience related to that (the vegetable thing)\nteacher: Chantelle = working class name/swearing in public obviously/underage drinking\nteacher: yes go ahead...you mean in the uk?\nstudent: When I worked as a waitress at Pembroke College, we had to serve a lot of different vegetables and students had to choose\nteacher: yes...\nstudent: I studied the names of all of them before they got in the canteen\nstudent: But when they had to ask, most of then said 'the green stuff', 'the orange stuff'.. and so on\nteacher: Ha! really? that's funny - they should know if they're at Cambridge!\nstudent: No, they didn't...\nstudent: Sorry, I'll read the sentence!\nstudent: Seriously! Do people talk like that? I\nteacher: Again, just to be clear Emily, there is ALSO a stereotype about posh teenagers is that they drink a lot and take drugs (and swear etc) - just in more private/exclusive surroundings!\nstudent: Sure!! Same here\nteacher: Ah you mean the 'Chantelle' thing?\nstudent: Yes, all the words her friend says to her\nteacher: Well sometimes! (at least in Asda - that's why i go to Waitrose - i;m a snob!)\nteacher: I think maybe some people are more anti-social in the UK than in SPain - but maybe i just havent' experienced enough places in Spain i don't know..\nstudent: Imagine poor Asda workers... they have to hear terrible things everyday and deal with very rude people\nteacher: I know there's also the stereotype about 'polite' English people which is kind of true\nteacher: Yes - it must be difficult for them sometimes i'm sure\nstudent: Maybe also difficult for Waitrose workers when they have to deal with  not very nice posh people\nteacher: I guess the people swearing don't exactly feel it's rude  you know? i.e. it's not meant in a personally aggressive/offensive way\nstudent: Sure, that's the saddest thing\nteacher: Yes absolutely! POsh people can be REALLY horrible when they're complaining to service workers!\nstudent: I mean when someone is rude and they don't even know they are...\nteacher: yes  sure -that's just upbringing i guess\nstudent: yes I think so\nteacher: OK thanks Emily - speak to you tomorrow!\nstudent: Yes, thank you very much\nteacher: cheers...\nstudent: I'll send you an email about next week hours...\nstudent: Bye bye",
    "teacher: Hi Sophia Smith...\nstudent: Good afternoon Mrs. Garcia.\nteacher: Hi, surviving? Not going crazy?\nstudent: today I found a very good website named Coursera\nstudent: there are various courses which I can choose\nteacher: Oh right.. you mean you looked at/found this website?\nstudent: yes.. I suppose it is very useful for me to learn something new\nteacher: yes of course - that's great...i've heard of it before ... is it free?\nteacher: Are the courses free?\nstudent: no.. a few courses are free\nteacher: Right OK ... but they look good? Like they;re worth paying for!\nteacher: What courses are you thinking of doing?\nstudent: I want to study 'Python'\nstudent: I suppose it is a new world for me.\nteacher: Oh right cool - so you haven't done much stuff with computers before?\nstudent: and I attempted to write an introduction for yesterday's question.\nstudent: no..I just studied the basics at school.\nteacher: OK good ... you attempted to write an intro .. show me if you're ready!\nstudent: yes\nstudent: It is often argued that the most effective way to lead a less stressful lifestyle is to rent a house. Obviously, it is difficult to assess the pros and cons of renting a house. In my opinion, although renting a house is convenient, some uncomfortable experiences can occur.\nteacher: OK... ('basic' knowledge better by the way)\nstudent: ok, thanks\nteacher: OK Sophia Smith .. give me a sec\nstudent: ok\nteacher: OK Sophia Smith so you have lots of great elements in here.. for example: It is often argued that the most effective way to lead a \u2026 lifestyle it is difficult to assess the pos and cons /  of renting a house / In my opinion, / although / plays a significant role /  occur\nteacher: pros and cons\nteacher: So yes.. lots of good bits.. a couple of things to think about coming up.... hold on!\nstudent: thanks, I really wanted to use the words which you were teaching me.\nteacher: Use an adjective beginning with 's' for the first gap and add a tiny little word for the second gap...can you do it?! It is often argued that the most effective way to lead a less ________  lifestyle is __ rent a house.\nstudent: depress   and   that\nteacher: stress = noun ... and the adjective is ______?\nstudent: stressful ?\nteacher: good try! 'Stressful' is what you need here! Good general word to know!\nstudent: wow..thanks\nstudent: so I can always use something like 'lead a (adjective) lifestyle' in the introduction,right?\nstudent: can\nteacher: well yes .. lead a healthy lifestyle/lead a glamorous lifestyle etc = good phrases yes\nteacher: or lead a stressful lifestyle = good too!\nteacher: relaxed lifestyle = good!\nteacher: OK so the next little word you need for the gap... let me give you this bit of help: the best way to get rich is + NOUN ..OR the best way to get rich is + TO + VERB: \u2026 The best way to get rich is starting your own business. The best way to get rich is to start your own business.\nteacher: So: It is often argued that the most effective way to lead a less stressful lifestyle is __ rent a house.??\nstudent: to OR house rental.\nteacher: OK thanks Sophia Smith - yes good\nteacher: This sentence coming up was great actually .. just one small thing: The words \u2018pros\u2019 and \u2018cons\u2019 are nouns, so delete one word from the sentence coming up to make it correct! \u201cObviously, it is difficult to assess the pros and cons effects of renting a house.\u201d\nstudent: yes, I see it... I need to delete the 'to'.\nstudent: maybe not...\nteacher: Hold on...! You've used the noun 'effects' right?\nstudent: I suppose it might be ' the'\nstudent: yes\nteacher: So the word(s) before 'effects' should be what? Adjectives/nouns/verbs? e.g. positive effect\nstudent: adjective\nteacher: the words 'positive' and 'negative' are adjectives - yes OK you've got it!\nteacher: So...if you use the nouns 'pros and cons' ?\nteacher: You DON'T need the noun 'effects'\nteacher: OK?\nstudent: so...I think I can delete 'effects'\nteacher: Yes good!\nteacher: pros and cons' already includes that idea\nteacher: OK last sentence = pretty good\u2026 two things: First gap = a general word for houses/flats etc beginning with \u2018p\u2019. Second gap = a modal verb please beginning with \u2018m\u2019! \u201cIn my opinion, although __________ rental plays a significant role, some uncomfortable experience _________ occur.\u201d\nteacher: you OK Sophia Smith?\nteacher: Let me know if you' re not sure! Or maybe internet problems....?\nstudent: sorry....\nstudent: I'm having Internet problems again.\nstudent: again\nstudent: so..if I'm willing to use 'effects', I can write 'it is difficult to assess the positive and negative effects of renting a house'.\nteacher: Yes perfect!\nstudent: first gap I think is paying\nteacher: Ah hold on ...so this is a word from yesterday that means buildings/houses/flats OK?\nteacher: prop_ _ _ _ ?\nstudent: I must admit I am not sure about the answers to these two gaps\nstudent: oh! property\nteacher: OK no probs...so 'property' - yes you;ve got it (almost!)\nteacher: OK Sophia Smith so i think the second gap is important  hold on..\nstudent: thanks..so the second one is maybe/might\nteacher: OK yes that's it!\nteacher: Because you CAN'T say : 'possible occur' together\nteacher: because occur is a verb right?\nteacher: OK so final intro pretty good for language...here it is: It is often argued that the most effective way to lead a less stressful lifestyle is to rent a house. Obviously, it is difficult to assess the pros and cons of renting a house. In my opinion, although property rental plays a significant role, some uncomfortable experiences may occur.\nstudent: so I can say possibly occur.\nteacher: yes good!\nstudent: yes... it's  perfect overall, thanks\nteacher: I'm impressed you worked that out for yourself...\nteacher: BUT Sophia Smith, there is one thing I want to check ...hold on\nstudent: haha...you always give me a lot of tips.\nstudent: ok\nteacher: The essay question yesterday was something like: 'What are the advantages of renting a home.' .... and the intro you've written feels like an intro to an essay question like this: 'How can we lead more relaxed lives?' Or maybe: 'Some people argue that the best way to lead a more relaxed life is to rent your home. Do you agree?' Do you see?!\nteacher: Don't worry about it now but i just wanted to point that out ok?\nstudent: yes...I think it maybe far away from the question.\nstudent: ok, thanks a lot\nteacher: OK no probs - but it was a good way to practise language anyway...\nteacher: A quick test coming up for you Sophia Smith OK? Hold on...\nstudent: yes... more practice, more improvement\nstudent: ok, I am ready\nteacher: Choose the best option in each example:  1. Watching films and television can lead to violence/violent.   2. Rising sea levels is a serious consequent/consequence of climate change.   3. Political/politics agreement is necessary to fight climate change.  4. Coronovirus has caused serious economy/economic problems.  5. People often argue about politics/political.\nteacher: OK?\nstudent: ok\nstudent: ok\nteacher: OK...I'll wait\nstudent: 1. violent   2. consequence of  3. political  4. economic  5.politics\nteacher: OK very good overall Sophia Smith thanks - just one wrong! Which one do you think?\nteacher: Follow the logic of your 4 correct answers and you should see it!\nstudent: number 1?  maybe it is what leads to violence.\nteacher: yes ok good!\nteacher: so we say  lead to SOMETHING (noun) right?\nteacher: violence = uncountable so we just say 'lead to violence'\nteacher: I'll give you a second quick test after the break with a few words we've seen this week!\nstudent: yes, no problem\nteacher: I think if you can get these nouns and adjectives in the right place you'll be doing well\nteacher: It's good to learn words together right?\nstudent: thanks, and it is necessary to identify whether a word is an adjective or a noun.\nstudent: it is necessary to identify whether a words is an adjective or a noun.\nteacher: I mean: try to remember the phrase (for example) 'positive effect' as two words together  so you don't have to always think too much (but sometimes you have to when you;re checking or learning it's true..)\nteacher: OK cheers - speak to you soon!\nstudent: wow, this is an easier way to study new words\nstudent: cheers - see you",
    "teacher: Hey there\nstudent: hi\nstudent: I am here\nteacher: OK! So I' ve got a quick vocabualary test coming up Emily Smith but first I just wondered if you could give me a few examples of useful words that have come up in the last few dayd\nteacher: days\nteacher: things that you've noticed and thought oh that;s good i 'll try to use that...\nstudent: innate/ fix/ birth/ inherit\nstudent: and...\nteacher: ok thanks - yes I remember these - all good words ..yes keep going great\nstudent: unaffordable\nstudent: imitate\nstudent: violent\nteacher: ok good good\nteacher: Finished?!\nstudent: yes\nteacher: OK thanks... well, I've made 10 questions for you and i've included some of your choices... i'll let you see the list of answers first quickly...here it is:\nteacher: set a good example readership  imitate bullying policies  unaffordable violent inherited innate birth\nteacher: OK? So you'll need one of these words to answer what's coming!\nteacher: Try to remember the options as best you can!\nteacher: OK are you ready?\nstudent: yes.. I got it\nteacher: OK cool so first  I'm going to waste some space so that you can't see the option on the screen\nteacher: OK cool so first  I'm going to waste some space so that you can't see the option on the screen\nteacher: OK cool so first I'm going to waste some space so that you can't see the option on the screen\nteacher: OK cool so first I'm going to waste some space so that you can't see the option on the screen\nteacher: OK cool so first I'm going to waste some space so that you can't see the option on the screen\nteacher: OK cool so first I'm going to waste some space so that you can't see the option on the screen\nteacher: OK cool so first I'm going to waste some space so that you can't see the option on the screen\nteacher: OK cool so first I'm going to waste some space so that you can't see the option on the screen\nteacher: OK cool so first I'm going to waste some space so that you can't see the option on the screen\nteacher: OK cool so first I'm going to waste some space so that you can't see the option on the screen\nteacher: OK cool so first I'm going to waste some space so that you can't see the option on the screen\nteacher: Here we go! Don't look up!\nteacher: 1. Governments need to develop more effective ___________ to fight climate change.  2. Many rich people __________ their wealth from their parents.  3. The New York Times is an important newspaper with a very large__________.  4. Unfortunately, some young people may ___________ violence they see in the media. 5. Humans seems to have an innate capacity for language. We start \u2018speaking\u2019 at _______.  6. Parents need to set a good __________ so that their children behave well.  7.

This can include verbal and physical aggression of various kinds.  9. Some individuals seem to have an ________ musical talent.  10. Some video games are very __________ and are completely inappropriate for younger children.\nteacher: You can do them in any order ok? And you can just give me one answer at a time or I'll wait for all ten - I don't mind OK?\nstudent: ok.. I will write all answers\nteacher: OK\nstudent: 1. policy   2.inherit   3.readership   4.bullying   5.birth   6.example   7.unaffordable   8.violence   9.innate   10.\nstudent: 10.violent\nteacher: OK thanks a lot Emily Smith - very good. So I agree that 10. = violent.....so number 4 = ?\nstudent: I think  4. imitate\nteacher: yes that's it good\nteacher: And number 8?\nstudent: yes!!\nstudent: 8. bullying\nteacher: ok well done\nstudent: thanks\nteacher: Emily Smith - you can imagine you might get an essay question on bullying( i know one my students got this question in the exam a few months ago) - a cause and solution question\nteacher: in other words: what the causes of bullying (in schools) and what are the solutions\nstudent: ok, I'm willing to attempt\nteacher: OK  fine - can I ask you first quickly: is bullying a problem in Chinese schools\nteacher: ?\nstudent: yes, without a doubt.\nteacher: Right I;m sorry to hear that ... what kind of thing happens?\nstudent: sometimes a student who doesn't like studying or is much stronger than others\nstudent: stronger\nstudent: will bully people.\nteacher: OK .. you mean physically?\nstudent: yes!! especially in some poorer areas.\nteacher: Right.. you mean poorer areas?\nstudent: yes... and some students who were bullied then change school, but they possibly become new bullies\nteacher: Yes i see (good use of the passive by the way!)  - 'bully' = the person too\nstudent: ok..so they may become new bullies\nstudent: but it is difficult to come up with ways to solve this problem.\nteacher: Yes correct - Just to be clear Emily Smith : so bullying can include hitting or calling people names or making fun of others\nteacher: making them feel bad in any way/excluding them for example\nstudent: because they are all minors. We can't use laws sometimes.\nteacher: Ah yes good point - you can't call the police for example\nteacher: So who is responsible for dealing with it then?\nstudent: ok...so if it includes laughing at someone, I think it happens all the time.\nstudent: I think the biggest proportion of responsibility lies with parents\nstudent: and then is the country's education system.\nteacher: Ha! I see what you mean... well i guess it means laughting at someone a lot over time  with the result that they feel humiliated and their self-esteem may duffer you know?\nstudent: yes... I understand it now.\nteacher: OK thanks so schools and parents have the biggest responsibility for dealing with it\nteacher: One final question Emily Smith: do you think bullying is worse than in the past?\nstudent: no.. I don't think so, as time goes by, the number of educated people grows\nstudent: as a result, they become teachers and parents.\nstudent: they have a softer way of dealing with this problem.\nteacher: OK right understood... people often talk about the impact of social media in connection with this problem nowadays - do you think that's significant?\nstudent: ways\nteacher: ok: they deal with this problem more sensitively = good\nstudent: yes!!! absolutely\nteacher: or: they are more sympathetic\nstudent: social media is the biggest problem\nstudent: ok, thanks\nteacher: or: they are more aware of the problem/they have a greater awareness of the harm that bullying can do\nteacher: OK so you agree that social media is a big problem? UNderstood...so Emily Smith if I can ask you then for the main causes of bullying you would identify in your essay what would they be (in quick keywords if you like!)\nteacher: ?\nstudent: social media\nteacher: ok fine....one more?\nstudent: and  the approach of parents and schools.\nstudent: schools\nteacher: OK great - so you mean that schools and parents don't....??\nstudent: they don't have more sympathetic approaches to deal with it.\nteacher: OK ...is that a cause? I suppose it could be! At least it explains why it doesn't stop ....\nteacher: Maybe slightly clearer as a cause would be the idea that schools/parents don't teach children that bullying is wrong?\nstudent: for example, they just punish them and do not give them any psychological support\nteacher: What do you think?\nteacher: OK understood: they don't provide them with counselling for example\nstudent: yes...\nteacher: or 'therapy' is another good word OK? (for counselling i mean)\nstudent: maybe it would be that schools and parents don't have a good example to deal with it.\nteacher: OK yes understood - fine. And the solution(s) therefore Emily Smith (again in quick keywords if you like) ?\nstudent: and it becomes a vicious circle.\nteacher: Yes good idea - a 'vicious circle' = the phrase you need here (and a good one!)\nstudent: the solution here is that  more companies / introduce a law that allows to track unsuitable behaviour on social media for minors.\nteacher: OK i get it - I'm saving that one for Monday - one more quickly?!\nstudent: introduce a law to punish behaviours which are bad for minors.\nstudent: yes.\nstudent: one more is that they should create many curricula for children's hearts.\nteacher: OK.. thanks Emily Smith i've got all that - we can continue on Monday OK? Same time if that's still OK with you ....have a good weekend if you can!\nstudent: yes, I am looking forward to seeing you on Monday.\nstudent: on Monday\nteacher: OK cool...bye for now\nstudent: bye.",
    "teacher: Hey Emily...\nstudent: Hello!\nteacher: HOw are you? Surviving?\nstudent: Yes, here I am :) still alive...\nstudent: Can you feel that it is Easter? do you say 'Easter' or 'Easter time'?\nstudent: I think that question is wrong...\nstudent: Here it feels like a normal week! no Easter atmosphere at all\nteacher: Um...does it feel like Easter to you? is OK!\nstudent: Sure!! Thanks\nteacher: Easter time = possible (just Easter = more normal)\nstudent: I see\nteacher: well it doesn't 'feel like' Easter to me no to be honest but...\nteacher: I think Easter in the UK is pretty much a non-event really (1% of Christmas)\nteacher: Time off work it's true (though that's not really relevant now of course)\nstudent: I see... it's quite different in Spain, especially in Andalusia. Did you like Easter events when you lived there?\nteacher: Yes I remember Semana Santa in Granada the first year I was in Spain - 'full on' is the word I'd use here!\nstudent: The idea I have about Easter in England is time off work and a lot of chocolate stuff at supermarkets (far more than here)\nteacher: By the way using the Spanish there is allowed I'd say...Holy Week is the official translation  but English people who'd seen it on holiday might use the Spanish...\nteacher: without 'La' though!\nteacher: Yes you're right of course about Easter here - just for selling Easter eggs really\nstudent: Yes  totally 'full on'! It must look a bit crazy to foreigners (procesiones)\nteacher: apart from the small minority who are actively religious\nteacher: yes the processions are ab it crazy for us i think!   One of the more 'foreign' things about Spain\nteacher: Flamenco is another thing that's definitely 'different'\nstudent: (One of the more 'foreign' things about Spain) not sure I understand the meaning of 'foreign' in this sentence\nstudent: Foreign= different\nteacher: I mean 'foreign' as in from an outsider's perspective (an English person's perspective - just different)\nstudent: I see\nteacher: But I guess there is a hint of it being a bit kind of primitive actually - i mean that's probably why i used the word 'foreign' unconsciously\nstudent: To be honest, processions are a bit or very crazy for me too... I used to be very scared of them when I was little. Now I just avoid them\nteacher: which is a bit revealing about Western European prejudices!\nteacher: Really? That's interesting - just because of the crowds or...?\nstudent: Not because of the crowds... because of the music, so sad and dark. Also the images of saints, not very nice, and the worst are the 'capuchinos' (people with weird hats hiding their faces)\nteacher: OK so just because you're Spanish it doesn't mean you can cope with it!  Yes Of course I agree with all you say really! I guess though that the kind of hard-core religious element must be gradually being toned down isn't it?\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: I'm still a bit unclear really about the whole Catholic culture thing - you know that younger people aren't really religious just 'culturally' Catholic...I mean i understand intellectually but i feel like i don't really get it you know?\nstudent: yes, I know. I don't get it at all\nteacher: Sorry Emily, just picking up on a little Spanishy sounding thing from before ( i think I've noticed this before too) : '...not very nice and the worst are the 'capuchinos'    So, more normal = e.g. the worst thing/bit is...OR the worst of it is ....\nstudent: I understand that, my grandma was very religious but nowadays I am not... But I respect people who believe\nstudent: going back to 'the worst'... you mean I have to use a third person verb right?\nteacher: Yes sure - I have no problem with it on a personal level (although I guess I'm very much not attracted to it and feel - oK I'll stop there actually!) - the whole new atheism thing gets quite a lot of attention here in the UK i'd say\nteacher: Um yes that's true but the important thing is that we normally add those little words to the phrase\nteacher: i.e. bit/thing or 'of it' NOT just 'worst'\nstudent: (the whole new atheism thing gets quite a lot of attention here) In which sense??\nteacher: or 'part' is very common too\nstudent: Ok I see the correction, thank you!\nteacher: ok!\nteacher: You know one really odd thing that's survived the UK? Religious assemblies in school!\nteacher: Bizzare given the vast majority of parents never go to church or whatever - just a hangover from the past\nteacher: You know that use of hangover right?\nstudent: Sure, we had them in the school I worked\nstudent: No I didn't! I like it (hangover use)\nteacher: yes i guessed it might be new!\nteacher: Just had a look on the corpus and there are several examples mixed in with the more frequent normal meaning\nstudent: OK, I'll have a look\nteacher: Three examples: There is something of a hangover from the last election at the moment. / This rule seems to be a hangover from the time when \u2026/ Being strong and silent um is a kind of is a kind of nineteenth century hangover \u2026\nteacher: examples 2 and 3 a bit clearer i guess\nstudent: Please, help me to understand the Corpus thingy...\nteacher: Ok...in what way? You mean the site? Or what it is? Or the specific examples?\nstudent: I get on the website, I write the word and then I have to click on something but there are a lot of options...     List  Chart  Collocates  Compare  KWIC\nteacher: Ah i see\nteacher: OK so if you just out in 'list' then in just gives you the one word that you enter in any context\nstudent: SEARCH FREQUENCY CONTEXT OVERVIEW more options\nteacher: But e.g. if you choose 'colocates' then e.g. put in 'vivid' (i think that was an example we used before?) and then press 1...\nteacher: This means that the results will give you the most common words just one word away i.e. nect to\nstudent: ohh I get this message ' You must do that to finish the registration, before logging in to use the corpora.\nteacher: so you get a list of words (highest frequency first) and it's:   MOST 44   96938 0.05 4.47  2    MEMORIES 39   2498 1.56 9.57  3    MORE 34   207227 0.02 3.00  4    BLUE 32   9941 0.32 7.29  5    PICTURE 25   10474 0.24 6.86  6    IMAGINATION 24   2459 0.98 8.89  7    ACCOUNT 20   15971 0.13 5.93  8    VERY 20   118500 0.02 3.04  9    MEMORY 19   7156 0.27 7.02  10    COLOURS 17   4313 0.39 7.59  11    ILLUSTRATION 13   1120 1.16 9.14  12    RED 13   14374 0.09 5.46  13    DREAM 12   4408 0.27 7.05  14    GREEN 12   14059 0.09 5.38  15    EXAMPLE 11   35735 0.03 3.91  16    DREAMS\nteacher: Sorry about the last entry - went a bit haywire!\nteacher: forget that!\nstudent: I'm lost! :(\nteacher: Um... right I'm not sure what's going on there for you...\nstudent: Are you talking about searching for 'chocolates' and 'vivid' at the same time??\nteacher: Oh no! not 'chocolates' ... 'collocates'!\nteacher: Can you see that heading?\nteacher: So this gives you all the words that collocate (go together) in order of frequency with a particular word you see?\nstudent: ahh sorry hahah How come I read chocolate??\nteacher: Well I didn't spell it exactly right! (i put colocates) which probably didn't help\nteacher: and chocolate is a about a ten  thousand times more common\nteacher: than 'collcates'\nteacher: Oh my god i spelled it wrong again sorry\nstudent: yes, (more common) and more attractive especially in quarantine\nstudent: Sorry, now I understand what you mean\nteacher: yes i guess so! Have you managed to control your food and drink consumption?!\nteacher: Right OK - you mean you're using the function on the site?\nstudent: I'm very lucky because I don't enjoy drinking... but I'm definitely eating more than I should... And you?\nstudent: (Right OK - you mean you're using the function on the site?) Yes I understood what you just explained to me\nteacher: Yes...I;m eating and drinking more...to be honest it's a double whammy for me because i'm not running either\nteacher: ok cool!\nstudent: whammy?\nstudent: we can't move much here either... a disaster!!\nteacher: Yeah 'whammy' only exists (as far as i know) in the phrase 'double whammy' - when two bad things happen at the same time\nstudent: Our president said yesterday that probably the lockdown (do you call it that? here it is 'confinamiento') might be extended until the 10th of May\nteacher: informal but normal\nteacher: well not every day but unremarkable phrase\nstudent: Interesting!\nteacher: yes 'lockdown' is the word! I only learned your word this week watching the news\nteacher: and all the other terms\nteacher: i mean translation for pandemic/contagious etc etc\nteacher: I don't mean they are all new words but you know - the actual translation being used\nteacher: Have you followed any of the news in English?\nstudent: Yes, I follow BBC News on Facebook, so I read something every day, at least the headlines\nstudent: Finally your president is not in intensive care, whatever, haha I don't know the words\nteacher: OK right - very conscientious of you - so yeah , you'll have picked up all the phrases we use....it's all good vocabulary\nteacher: no , intensive care = perfectly correct\nteacher: yes he's out now...so i guess he'll recover\nstudent: So you say, he is not in intensive care any more\nteacher: Probably be a while before he's back at work as it were - i suspect longer than people think\nstudent: In Spanish we would say that now he is 'in plant'\nteacher: he is not in intensive care any more = yes correct!\nteacher: oh yes all that stuff - and that mysterious phrase dar de alta\nteacher: I get it but it never comes naturally to me you know?\nstudent: Sure, he won't be working soon but at least he is not dying (verb to die with ing??) either\nteacher: you know the translation for it in English?\nstudent: dar de alta y dar de baja haha funny sentences... Alta m\u00e9dica y baja m\u00e9dica\nteacher: he's not dying soon = correct but a bit weird ... he's not going to die soon = normal\nstudent: (you know the translation for it in English?) Please, tell me!\nteacher: discharge'\nteacher: usually passive...as in : he's been discharged (from hospital)\nstudent: Does 'discharged' mean that the person went home?\nteacher: Yes exactly ..Actually i;m not sure if he's been discharged yet (?) - maybe he's just out of intensive care right?\nstudent: No, I heard on Spanish news that he is 'en planta'\nstudent: which means that he is in a normal room in a hospital\nstudent: normal\nteacher: ok i see\nteacher: i wonder whether he'll be more popular as a result of having been ill?\nteacher: early days i guess...(too soon to tell  i mean)\nstudent: haha maybe\nteacher: OK thanks Emily ... so i'll speak to you on Tuesday at 5 right? Have a good one!\nstudent: yes, thank you very much\nteacher: cheers then..\nstudent: Have a nice weekend at home\nteacher: :)",
    "student: good afternoon Mr. Cooper.\nteacher: Hi there Sarah, how's it going?\nstudent: yes... I just feel tired when I want to study a massive amount of new information\nstudent: it is difficult to see any improvement because it is all hard for me\nteacher: OK...you mean you feel overwhelmed by the huge task in front of you? You mean improving your English?\nteacher: Or other things?\nteacher: Python??!\nstudent: yes... including improving my English.\nstudent: I also spend a long time to learn each piece of information, which is overwhelming.\nteacher: Yes I see,,,it can seem very hard I know... it is a long process...you've just got to keep going step by step\nteacher: and have faith that you are improving (you are!)\nteacher: And try to enjoy the process\nteacher: Don't think about a 'finish line'\nstudent: yes...I really enjoy the whole process when I am learning some new information\nstudent: but sometimes I feel unhappy.\nteacher: Yes...can you set yourself small achievable goals?\nstudent: because I also forget a lot of information\nteacher: The problem sometimes is that you have no way to measure your progress you see?\nstudent: yes.. I thinks so, I just keep studying...\nteacher: Yes, well you won't remember everything the first time you know? You have to lean something many times before you really remember it - that's normal\nteacher: Yuu had to do that at the beginning too - you've just forgotten\nstudent: I assume it may be a long process\nteacher: Also, remember Sarah that memorising words and then trying to 'test' your memory is not easy - what really matters is that you can use the language you're studying you know?\nteacher: But for example, the changes you made to your use of tenses last week was a big step\nstudent: thanks for your encouragement\nteacher: it might not feel that way but any English speaker reading/listening to your correct present perfect/past simple or going to/will examples would notice a big difference\nteacher: OK fine!\nstudent: thanks very much.\nteacher: OK Sarah - let's have a quick practice of past/future OK? Tell me 5 things you did at the weekend if you can OK?\nstudent: yes, after we finished class, I reviewed the stuff which I studied in class, and on Saturday, I watched the videos from the Coursera course, and on Sunday I made some studying plans for the next week. Everything seems to be on the right track. However, in the morning when I was watching videos from my course, I also felt unhappy, because they are hard to understand no matter whether I listen to them or read. After today's class I am going to review those videos again. Actually, I really think that doing something new is really difficult at the beginning.\nteacher: OK thanks Sarah for all that  ... hold on asec\nstudent: seemed like - I forgot to use past simple here.\nteacher: yes OK got it!\nteacher: yes so...correct past simple verbs here and also a nice 'going to' for plans = great!\nteacher: So now I think I understand a bit more why you feel a bit down about your English!\nteacher: You have to remember Sarah that the videos on Coursera are not designed for non-natives - they would be hard for most students\nteacher: Also, you an't expect to understand everything...did you understand the main idea in the videos?\nteacher: can't expect I mean\nstudent: yes.. and another thing I am unhappy about is that our class ends on Wednesday.\nteacher: Yes I can understand that - it was quite a routine I can imagine...\nstudent: yes.. for example, the video required me to finish the task in 20 minutes, but it took me 1 or 2 hours to understand.\nstudent: required me to\nteacher: OK i see ... that is quite ambitious - perhaps you should try something a bit easier?\nstudent: but.. until now, I've really felt my English has been improving while I have been studying with you, I've really enjoyed the time when I have been studying online with you.\nstudent: has been improving\nteacher: feel has been improving = very good present perfect continuous ... has improved  = also possible\nstudent: haha.... I am not sure why I repeated the sentences.....\nteacher: That's OK - important thing is it's NOT past simple\nteacher: OK Sarah - shall we try a completely new topic to just get going and forget about these problems\nstudent: yes.. I am ready.\nteacher: OK ... I've just made some material on the topic of space (spending on space exploration ) ... why don't you tell me some words that you think might be useful to include in an essay on this topic? Give me three to start if you can ok?\nteacher: Anything that comes to mind!\nstudent: one of the most ....\nstudent: another reason why....is that\nstudent: advantageous and disadvantageous effects\nstudent: obviously\nstudent: for instance\nteacher: OK thanks Sarah... so these phrase could definitely be useful in a lot of different essays that's true.....hold on....\nteacher: these phrases\nstudent: ok\nstudent: in my opinion\nteacher: OK let me use one of your phrases and ask you to finish it  ok? 'Another reason why we should spend money on space exploration is that...'\nteacher: A quick idea if possible!\nstudent: ......is that humans are not in isolation in space.\nstudent: I am sure..\nstudent: not sure\nteacher: OK thanks ... 'isolation' = nice word.... you mean that there is life on other planets?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: OK undestood! So can you change your sentence to show that this just a possibility?\nstudent: humans want to spend millions on the search for alien life.\nteacher: OK thanks ... 'spend millions on searching for alien life' = good sentence yes! Do you think this is a good idea? Do you think we should spend this money?\nstudent: yes,  I agree with it.\nstudent: because it can make humans aware of the fact that we are not the only  intelligent species in space.\nteacher: OK so .... going back to the idea that you say you are not SURE there is life on other planets.... do you remember talking about rolling the dice and getting a double six?  this is 'unl_ _  _ _ _ _ '??\nstudent: unlikely\nstudent: unlikely\nteacher: OK well remembered! So you think that it is __________ that alien life exists.?\nstudent: it is likely that alien life exists.\nteacher: OK great ... so a good topic sentence could be: 'One reason why I think we should spend money on space exploration is that it is likely that alien life exists.' OK?\nstudent: yes, it is clearer\nteacher: OK  ... what could you say in a paragraph like this? I mean, why is it good to find alien life?\nteacher: Remeember the stupid person? The stupid person would say: OK fine maybe there is life but so what? Why should I pay tax to try to find it??\nstudent: because we can move our attention from money to other things, such as arts and science.\nstudent: arts and sience.\nstudent: science\nteacher: You mean as a result of finding alien life?\nstudent: which have different values\nteacher: OK so you mean finding alien life would inspire us to change our behaviour? OK I see what you mean...\nstudent: yes, I think if we just focus on money or daily problems, we may become more materialistic.\nteacher: materialistic = the adjective you need here (good word)\nstudent: yes... I think it is a strange idea...\nteacher: Are there any arguments in favour of spending money on space exploration which might be easier to explain?\nstudent: I think If I disagree with this idea, it is easier to explain\nteacher: Oh sorry Sarah - can you hold that though t and tell me after the break OK? OK i see your point there...we'l c ome back to it OK? bye for now..\nstudent: yes, see you\nteacher: ok!",
    "teacher: Hey there...\nstudent: hi - I am here\nteacher: OK Emma Smith ... I've been thinking about the topic and arguments in favour  of investment space exploration..  hold on\nteacher: Have a look at these 4 main ideas (just keywords) and see of you agree which one you agree and why OK?\nstudent: yes, ok\nteacher: Sorry: see if you agree with any of them and why...\nteacher: International co-operation/ Economic self-interest/ Technological progress/ Long-term survival\nteacher: Any quick ideas about which one you think might be a good idea?\nteacher: Remember: they are all in favour of space exploration\nstudent: a reason for international cooperation: humans are one family rather than different countries.\nstudent: I remember the test that you did with us, whether one is a left- or right-wing person\nteacher: Ah ok.. you mean left wing or right wing...\nstudent: yes..\nteacher: on the left' or 'on the right' (politically) ..\nteacher: So the idea here Emma Smith is that countries co-operate to develop space technology you know?\nteacher: Are you aware that this has happened?\nteacher: Can you think of an example? (I mean a real one!)\nteacher: Don;t worry if not!\nstudent: yes! the international space station.\nstudent: built by NASA\nteacher: OK great example....\nteacher: So... 'The International Space Station ____  b _ _ _  _ by NASA.'?\nstudent: The International Space Station was built by NASA.\nteacher: Hold on Emma Smith: one correct way of saying this = 'NASA built the ISS' the passive way = 'The International Space Station ____ b _ _ _ _ by NASA.'?\nstudent: the international space station is built by NASA.\nteacher: Present?\nteacher: good 'built' though!\nstudent: I suppose NASA is still expanding the International space station.\nstudent: so.. 'is' here is correct, right?\nteacher: Ah ok fine! Well I guess you could say then: 'NASA is building the International...'\nteacher: But hold on - isn't NASA American?!\nstudent: yes... but they also have spacemen from other countries.\nteacher: OK fine! 'spacemen' = 'astro_ _ _ _ _ '?\nteacher: astronauts (sorry!)\nstudent: I forgot the spelling...\nteacher: That's OK!\nstudent: ok. thanks\nteacher: :)\nstudent: ^-^\nteacher: OK so: We've got the first two sentences of our paragraph don't you think?\nstudent: yes, I think so\nteacher: Main idea + example .... can you write them quickly?\nstudent: yes, I will try\nteacher: OK!\nteacher: One reason why...\nstudent: One of the main reasons why the government spends millions on the search for alien life is that countries co-operate to develop space technology. For instance, The International Space Station is built by NASA,  which is an American research institution. However, they always have astronauts from other countries.\nteacher: OK thanks Emma Smith hold on a sec ...\nstudent: ok\nteacher: OK just a quick change to make it an answer to a 'Do you agree ' type essay first OK? : one of the main reasons why I think the government should expenditure millions on search of alien life is that countries co-operate to develop space technology. For instance, the International Space Station is built by NASA which is the American research institution\ufffd\uff7c\u7c82owever, they always have other country's astronauts.\nteacher: OK not bad.... a couple of other questions coming for you ... hold on...\nstudent: ok\nteacher: So good = search FOR alien life/ develop space technology/ For instance/ However, \u7ab6\uff66\nteacher: Question: Is expenditure a noun?\nstudent: yes... so  expenditure of public money on the search for alien life.\nstudent: OR  government expenditure on the search for alien life.\nstudent: expenditure of public money on the search for alien life.\nteacher: Sorry..internet...! OK hold on..I think the government should + NOUN right? So you can't have 'expenditure' next here ...\nteacher: Can you solve this problem here?\nstudent: so could I use 'of ' to link two nouns.\nstudent: no.....I do not think so\nteacher: Um...what about the should'?\nteacher: should'\nstudent: yes! I understood the regulation\nteacher: How about: One reason why I think government expenditure on space exploration is justified is because...\nstudent: just add a verb\nteacher: OK?\nteacher: Yes fine which verb?!\nstudent: should spend on the search for alien life.\nstudent: oh....I am wrong\nstudent: should\nstudent: just change expenditure to expend/spend\nteacher: OK yes good! 'spend' = right!\nteacher: I'm just asking you to think about this because this is a problem which comes up a lot in IELTS (task 1 too( - i mean problems with expenditure/spending and spend)\nstudent: yes.. I will remember this stuff\nstudent: thanks\nstudent: thanks\nteacher: one of the main reasons why I think the government should spend millions on searching for alien life is that countries co-operate to develop space technology. For instance, the International Space Station was built by NASA which is an American research institution\ufffd\uff7c\u7c82owever, they always have astronauts from other countries on board..\nteacher: So this is fine Emma Smith thanks! How could you add to this?!\nteacher: Any ideas?\nstudent: add a consequence?\nteacher: OK...such as? IN quick simple words if you like...\nstudent: as a consequence, we can share high technology and relations between different countries become closer\nteacher: OK not bad tahnks\nstudent: but it is bad English I know..\nteacher: Emma Smith rememebr the other ideas? : International co-operation/ Economic self-interest/ Technological progress/ Long-term survival\nstudent: I need to replace some words with synonyms\nstudent: I need to replace some words with synonyms\nteacher: No it's good hold on... Only one tiny mistake technically :  'As a consequence, we can share high technology and relations become close between different countries.'\nstudent: sorry my internet became slow just now.\nteacher: Did you see the tiny change? (One letter!)\nstudent: relationships/relations\nteacher: Yes ok fine ... 'relationships' is logical and often possible BUT 'relations' very common in this context (e.g. international relations )\nteacher: BUT with 's' at the end!\nstudent: ok, thanks\nteacher: do you know the word 'colloborate'?\nstudent: no.. it looks more advanced\nteacher: Well - it's a nice word yes... Does it mean work together or work separately do you think?\nstudent: I think it may mean 'work together'\nteacher: yes you're right... a good synonym for co-operate...how about 'sophisticated' - do you know this word?\nstudent: no, it is a 100% new word\nteacher: ok! Does it mean simple or advanced do you think?\nstudent: more advanced I believe\nteacher: ok yes good so 'sophisticated technology' = a good phrase\nteacher: OK thanks Emma Smith - don't get too down about your English! You're making progress one step at a time...\nstudent: ok, thanks very much\nteacher: All right cheers - speak to you tomorrow!\nstudent: I know it is time to say bye\nstudent: yes..see you tomorrow\nteacher: ok bye...\nstudent: thanks a lot",
    "student: good afternoon Ms. Gonzalez.\nteacher: Hi there Alexandra...\nteacher: Hello - are you doing? Feeling more positive today?\nstudent: yes, I have a motive to study because today I booked my new IELTS test on the 20th of June in China.\nteacher: OK I see - yes that's great...good to have a short-term goal.\nstudent: I have a new goal for this exam. I need 7.0 in total and I want to get 7.0 for each part\nteacher: OK...well, work hard and see what happens...7.0 would be a very good score\nteacher: not easy!\nteacher: Have you done any whole reading or listening tests recently?\nteacher: IF so, what scores are you getting more or less?\nstudent: yes I know, actually a total of 6.5 is enough for my university\nstudent: I am going to do the whole test beginning from tomorrow.\nteacher: OK I see - this is the LSE course right? Yes, good idea to get some test practice\nstudent: unlikely...LSE requires a total of 7.0 and 7.0 for each part.  But Queen Mary University of London, which is my first degree university, requires 6.5.\nstudent: and the course is principles of accounting at the summer school.\nteacher: right i see ('likely' = nice!)\nstudent: I mean the course at LSE.\nstudent: thanks\nteacher: The name of the subject Alexandra = 'acc_  _ _ _ ing'?\nstudent: I always think when I chat with you online, my mind is working\nstudent: accounting\nteacher: Yes I hope so!\nteacher: Yes good accounting....and the person/job?\nstudent: but... when I study by myself, my brain becomes slow.\nstudent: accountant?\nteacher: accountant!\nstudent: ok, thanks\nteacher: Well I guess that's why teachers are useful...\nstudent: and one more thing I am planning...\nstudent: yes!! it is true\nteacher: It;s hard to do everything yourself sometimes...\nteacher: yes go ahead..\nstudent: I am planning to find a part time assisant job before my university starts.\nteacher: OK sounds good,,,,what kind of assistant?\nstudent: I think one of the possible reasons is that students always confuse answers and they are just learners. In other words, we just know how to use knowledge rather than acknowledge the principles of stuff.\nstudent: I think it might relate to finance.\nteacher: OK i see\nteacher: Alexandra give me a sec...I must want to give you some examples...\nstudent: ok, thanks\nteacher: nearly there sorry\nteacher: OK Alexandra - have a look and tell me if these are true or false for you if you don't mind OK? 1. I\u2019m not very motivated to get a good score in IELTS. 2. I\u2019m proud of my level of English. 3. I\u2019m scared of not getting a high score in my IELTS exam. 4. I was disappointed with my last IELTS score.  5. I\u2019m happy with my maths skills. 6. I\u2019m annoyed about having to stay in quarantine.  7. I\u2019m looking forward to my IELTS exam.  8. I\u2019m excited about the next (football) World Cup.\nstudent: 1. false 2.false 3.true 4. true 5. true 6. false 7. true 8. true.\nteacher: OK thanks Alexandra! So, in summary: You didn't get the IELTS score you wanted before and you;re going to try really hard to improve and even looking forward to the opportunity to do better but you're a bit worried about it.  On the other hand, you're satisfied with your maths ability and are dealing well with quarantine ( i think you are overall!) and you're keen on football!\nteacher: OK?\nstudent: One of the possible reasons why teachers are imperative is that students struggle with learning by themselves because it is difficult to recognise the principles of stuff. As a result, they may lose motivation to study.\nstudent: I altered my sentences\nstudent: yes!! you are right.  ok!! thanks\nteacher: OK hold on a sec..\nteacher: OK thanks for your point Alexandra - I understand and agree...look at this example again (coming up) and then change the bit of your sentece if you can? 1. I\u2019m not very motivated to get a good score.\nteacher: Tell me again about students and their lack of motivation (but use the adjective!)\nstudent: I am unmotivated\nteacher: OK yes good OK and the students? They may not be m_________  _____ study.?\nstudent: they may not be motivated to study.\nteacher: look back for the word you need after 'motivated'\nstudent: they may not be motivated to study.\nteacher: yes ok good! So the important thing here Alexandra (from my English teacher point of view!) is that you use the correct adjective + preposition ok? Hold on\nstudent: ok\nteacher: OK remember these adjectives from before? Tell me the preposition you need to use after each one OK? Can you write each work again with the correct preposition please? motivated/proud/scared/disappointed/happy/annoyed/excited\nteacher: each word i mean sorry\nteacher: So for example: 'motivated TO' right? Keep going!\nstudent: motivated to / proud of / scared of / disappointed with / happy with / annoyed with / excited about\nstudent: I think it is hard for me\nstudent: I don't know the rules for prepositions\nteacher: Yes these are hard to remember  there are no rules I'm afraid!! Don't worry, this is why we're going to practise them! So look back Alexandra and find the words you need after: excited and disappointed (your other answers are correct)\nstudent: excited about / disappointed with\nteacher: OK good thanks\nstudent: thanks\nteacher: It's abit of a nightmare and sometimes more than one preposition is possible (with sometimes a small change in meaning) BUT don't worry about that now - let#s just practice with what we've got...OK so if you can Alexandra tell me something about yourself using: happy/disappointed/excited/annoyed/proud/scared/motivated OK? just do one at a time if you like (choose any one you like)\nteacher: I'll give you my own examples as you go along but don't stop OK?\nstudent: ok\nteacher: My example: I'm _____  _____with my new car (it's working fine). ?\nstudent: I'm very happy with my new car\nteacher: OK thanks Alexandra - shall we do a few more test ones like this first ? (before your examples)\nstudent: I am disappointed with my shortage of memory.\nstudent: yes\nteacher: I'm really _______  ________ my new phone - the camera is rubbish and the battery doesn't last very long either!\nteacher: Ah same example! good!\nstudent: I am really unhappy with / disappointed with my new phone.\nteacher: yes both good\nteacher: My daughter is really _______  _______ her birthday party tomorrow.\nstudent: my daughter is really excited about her birthday party tomorrow.\nteacher: ok good\nstudent: I am really excited about my new life at the university in the UK.\nteacher: I've always ______  _______  ______spiders even though there are no dangerous ones in the UK.\nstudent: I have always felt scared of spider even though there are no dangerous ones in the UK.\nstudent: scared of\nteacher: yes good correction\nteacher: can you change the verb 'feel' ?\nteacher: the present = I am scared\nteacher: and in this example?\nstudent: I have always felt scared of spiders\nteacher: I have always __________ scared of spiders.?\nteacher: Don't use 'feel'! What verb do you need?\nteacher: A simple verb!\nteacher: But the past participle (because you;re using the present perfect)\nstudent: I have always  felt scared of spiders\nstudent: felt?\nteacher: no! a different verb! NOT feel/feels/felt/feeling etc\nteacher: be be be be be be !!\nstudent: been\nteacher: Yes!\nstudent: because it is a feeling so we use 'be'\nteacher: Sorry I know that wasn't easy - I wanted to change the tense to make you think about it\nstudent: right?\nstudent: yes, thanks\nteacher: well Alexandra - we just usually use the verb 'be' with these adjectives\nstudent: wow... I got it\nteacher: like e.g. rich/poor/old etc - not because it's a feeling\nteacher: So in a way this bit is the easy bit (the verb I mean) - the thing you have to get right is the adjective itself and the preposition that comes next you see?\nteacher: OK see you in 15 mins ok?\nstudent: yes..thanks  see you",
    "teacher: Hi there...\nstudent: hi\nteacher: OK Alexandre ... so if you're ready, have a think about what you can tell about yourself using any of these adjectives:\nteacher: proud/scared/excited/disappointed/\nteacher: motivated/annoyed\nteacher: and...happy!\nteacher: present or past you decide ok?\nteacher: But use the verb 'be' !!\nteacher: You could include examples with other people if you like!\nteacher: E.g. My brother was...\nteacher: You decide\nstudent: ok, I am ready\nstudent: I am proud of participating in your class.\nstudent: I am proud of participating in your class.\nteacher: OK thanks Alexandre - good example! And...yes good correction\nteacher: so proud of participating / or proud of  my participation = both good\nstudent: ok\nteacher: keep going...\nstudent: and next is that my sister is scared of exams at the end of every term.\nstudent: I am excited about studying English with you every day.\nteacher: OK fine! She's scared of examinations (less formal/normal in speaking = exams) at the end of every term\nteacher: OK good example!\nstudent: ok, thanks\nteacher: one more if you can...\nstudent: my parents are disappointed with my last IELTS score.\nteacher: OK good (but bad :(  i know...)  and in the past?\nstudent: I always study new things when I'm motivated to do so.\nstudent: my parents were disappointed with my last IELTS score.\nteacher: ok good\nteacher: but bad sorry\nteacher: OK Alexandre: 'when I had full motivation on it.'  try this again BUT with the verb/adjective structure we're focusing on ok?\nteacher: So: ...' when I ____  f______  _______.'\nteacher: don't include 'on it' unnecessary here\nstudent: when I am fully motivated.\nteacher: OK much better yes....before the adjective you need an...?\nteacher: full' = adjective but you need an ...?\nstudent: I am fully motivated.\nteacher: no no no no no come back Alexandre ...you ONLY need the verb be again OK?!!\nteacher: so when i am ______ motivated = good! Just change 'full'  to full_?\nteacher: add a  leeter to make it an adverb\nteacher: a letter i mean\nstudent: when I am fully motivated\nstudent: when I am fully motivated.\nteacher: OK yes!\nteacher: So if you're using these adjectives you can almost always use 'be' OK? e.g. I am /you are  etc OR I was / they were etc\nteacher: If you start using lots other verbs it can easily go wrong!\nstudent: yes.. I understood... thanks\nteacher: OK ....however...let's have a think about the nouns ok?\nstudent: ok\nteacher: So can you give me the nouns for the adjectives? so change these into nouns if you can: proud/happy/excited/annoyed/disappointed\nteacher: and...motivated/scared\nstudent: proud - pride / happy - happiness  / excited - excitement / annoyed - annoyance/ disappointed - disappointment\nstudent: motivated - motivation / scared -\nstudent: yes...\nteacher: OK thanks Alexandre .. sorry internet probs...hold on a sec\nstudent: ok.. no problem\nteacher: so pride/happiness/excitement/annoyance (anger common too) /disappointment/motivation/fear (the normal noun for all 3 adjectives scared/frightended/afraid)\nteacher: you got some of them!\nteacher: excitation = exists but very unusual (forget it!)\nstudent: ok, I'll write them down in my notebook\nstudent: thanks\nteacher: OK Alexandre - so e.g. 'there is a lot of __________ about the next World Cup' choose a noun!\nteacher: People are very ______ about it ' = same idea - choose an adjective\nstudent: there is a lot of information about the next World CUp\nteacher: Choose a noun from the ones we've just looked at!\nstudent: ok...sorry\nteacher: People are looking forward to it = there is a lot of _________ ?\nstudent: excitement\nteacher: ok good!\nteacher: Coronavirus has caused a lot of _______ among the population.\nteacher: ?\nstudent: fear\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: The possibility of discovering life on other planets is a important _______ for space scientists.\nstudent: motivation\nteacher: ok good\nteacher: There is a lot of   _ _  _ _ _ about the way the government has tackled Coronavirus.\nteacher: People are not happy i mean!\nstudent: disappointment\nteacher: Yes ok fine ... or a stronger emotion?\nstudent: fear ?\nteacher: yes ok\nteacher: good\nstudent: thanks\nteacher: There is  a lot of _______ in the NHS (National Health Service) in the UK and the way it has responded to the challenge of Coronavirus.\nteacher: People think it has done a good job i mean\nstudent: pride\nteacher: ok good\nteacher: The decision to extend the lockdown for another week at least has caused a lot of ________? (People were looking forward to going out and now they can't!)\nstudent: happiness\nteacher: ...and now they can't '= good?\nstudent: annoyance\nteacher: yes possible ! or 'disappointment' = good (they were looking forward to it)\nteacher: OK Alexandre so i've given you some moun examples ... see if you remember the ideas and can answer the following questions with the same idea OK?\nteacher: noun examples i mean\nstudent: yes\nteacher: 1. People ____  very ___ the next World Cup. 2. People ____ very ____ about the government\u2019s handling of Coronavirus.  3. People ____  very ___scared about Coronavirus. 4. British people ____  very ______ of the doctors and nurses working in the NHS.  5. People ____  very _____ they still can\u2019t go out because of the lockdown.\nteacher: Oh sorry hold on ignore these - mistake!!!\nstudent: ok\nteacher: 1. People are  very ___ _____the next World Cup. 2. People are very ____   _____ the government\u2019s handling of Coronavirus.  3. People are  very ___  _____ of getting  Coronavirus. 4. British people are  very ______ ______  the doctors and nurses working in the NHS.  5. People are   very _____ _____ the extension of the lockdown.\nteacher: OK these are good - go for it! Just choose words we've looked at OK? If you can' t do one just do the next one!\nteacher: Give me one answer when you can Alexandre OK?\nstudent: excited about\nstudent: yes\nteacher: OK great!\nteacher: keep going...\nstudent: disappointed with\nstudent: scared of\nstudent: happy with\nteacher: yes ok good (disappointED with)\nteacher: Do you understand number 5?\nstudent: annoyed with\nteacher: Yes ok great!\nstudent: maybe it means people are isolated at home\nteacher: So you can see the possibilities Alexandre right? You just need to focus on getting the adjective + prepositions right first\nstudent: yes, and I need to remember them as a team.\nteacher: The nouns are a bit more complicated because you have more choice with the  language around them you see?\nteacher: E.g. 'cause excitement' .... 'led to disappointment' etc\nteacher: Yes you're right - they are isolated at home and can't leave = correct definition\nstudent: yes.. there are a lot of words we can use with nouns\nteacher: But actually often you can just say: 'there is' + the noun you see?\nteacher: Yes....I kow you want to use 'academic' language and it's true that nouns are quite imoprtant BUT soemtimes just use the verb 'be' = adjective and just get it  right ok?\nstudent: yes,  I still remember the example is that there are various museums in London.\nstudent: thanks... because correct is the most imperative part.\nteacher: Hey sorry - my internet went again\nstudent: that's ok\nteacher: Hi..Yes, the museum example is a great point here..exactly!\nteacher: there is + noun is like to be + adjective ...usually correct!\nteacher: OK cheers Alexandre ...speak to you tomorrow...well done\nstudent: ok, thank you very much\nteacher: bye,....\nstudent: see you\nstudent: bye...",
    "teacher: Hey there Alexandra...\nstudent: Hi Mr. Johnson\nstudent: How are you doing?\nteacher: Yeah i'm good thanks....still deep into lockdown...\nteacher: how about you?\nstudent: Here the same, it seems it'll last until May :(\nteacher: yes i see...another few weeks then...last/go on until May\nstudent: I'm alright. A bit stressed at the moment. The online version of the training course is chaos\nteacher: But the light's at the end of the tunnel right?\nstudent: I don't see much light at the moment to be honest hah\nstudent: honest\nteacher: Ah right - yes ... doing everything online is ok in theory maybe but in practice...\nteacher: the course is chaotic/a mess/a disaster etc\nstudent: ok thank you\nteacher: is it live on Zoom or something?\nstudent: yes, we meet every day at 9 on Zoom and we are there listening to our teacher until 2pm\nstudent: and after that we have to do a lot of exercises... so a lot of work\nteacher: Wow..a long time (and mostly the teacher talking?)\nstudent: far more than when we went to classes\nteacher: yes i see - far from ideal\nstudent: Teacher talking and students (we're 20 people) asking or interrupting.... it didn't happen before\nstudent: Maybe it's just the beginning and it'll get better (I hope so)\nteacher: Yes i see- it's tricky to manage the turn-taking  - does the teacher use breakout rooms?\nstudent: Can I ask you a few things I'm not sure about?\nteacher: Yes sure...\nstudent: ohh sorry, I didn't see your question... What are breakout rooms?\nteacher: Ah ...well I've just realised I think they're only available on the Zoom 'Pro' account\nteacher: But\nstudent: I see... no we don't have a Pro account\nteacher: they allow you to give people (students) time to work together in separate 'rooms'\nteacher: the host can enter each room when they like\nstudent: I see, that would be great\nteacher: yes it's very effective (i was doing lessons on Zoom for a bit)\nstudent: no, we all work at the same time so\nstudent: Well, I'm not sure about the use of 'I' or 'me' in sentences like\nteacher: Do they use any other functions to allow/control participation? e.g. chatbox/take control of the screen function/whiteboard/screenshare (even?)/ sharing files?\nteacher: Sorry go on...\nstudent: Maria and I went to the park', 'Maria and me....',  'She and me...' , 'she and I...'\nstudent: My question is about when we use 'me' or 'I' in this type of sentences?\nteacher: OK so ... basically in normal everyday speaking we often say ... me and Maria/Maria and me = common\nteacher: MAria and I' = more careful and some people feel this is the 'correct' way .... in writing you;d usually  see thi sform\nstudent: Then both are correct?\nteacher: In a test or if you want to copy a more careful (pedantic?!) native speaker then e.g. my friend and i = the correct option\nteacher: YOu will here tens of millions of people say the other way too (including me) so in this sense it is correct too yes\nstudent: Great, clear now... I thought that one was wrong... I was concerned about using it wrongly\nteacher: Yes I understand ... they are both absolutely correct in the sense of common use ...but yes one is more informal than the other\nstudent: Actually we generally hear 'you and me...'\nstudent: You and I...' sounds weird, doesn't it?\nteacher: and SOME people would never say 'me and my friend...'\nteacher: yes much less common\nstudent: what about 'you and Maria are good friends'?\nstudent: You and she/her are good friends??\nteacher: OK hold on...let me clear my head!\nteacher: so you and maria sounds fine\nteacher: you and he are good friends = sounds better than you and him (it;s the nominative form)\nteacher: more correct yes BUT you will hear people say 'you and him for the subject as in 'you and him can go' but less 'correct''\nstudent: I see... In Spanish it is a very common structure, maybe not so common in English?\nteacher: Yes i think that's right - that's why even though it seems such a simple phrase it's doesn't come easily to me...\nstudent: Yes, that's what I thought\nteacher: Hold on ..give me a quick everyday example sentence (transalated from Spanish) if you can...\nstudent: Imaging a situation in the classroom. Students have to work in pairs and you say: 'Marian and Pablo will work together'\nstudent: Now the same without their names 'she and he (you pointing at them) will work together??\nteacher: yes i see ... aahhhh\nstudent: or she and him??\nstudent: maybe you just say 'you two will work together' (pointing at them)\nteacher: she and he would be correct yes but just sounds weird because you'd say 'they'\nteacher: !!\nstudent: I see, so let's forget about it... I was translating from Spanish\nstudent: Sorry!!!\nteacher: no that's OK - it's a fair question...just frustrating somehow\nteacher: and sorry yes...looking back ...exactly yes 'you two' = again the normal way\nstudent: No frustration! I got it :)\nstudent: And another much easier question!!\nteacher: OK...\nstudent: The last time (or the last day??) we talked, when we said good bye to each other you said 'have a good one'\nstudent: what does that sentence mean? Have a good day?\nteacher: The last time we talked/when we talked the other day......and yes...have a good day is the origin i guess..but we kind of use it indiscriminately to mean e.g. weekend or whatever OR just see you later alternative! informal but normal for many people\nteacher: sorry i'm using such lazy writing there! (ellipsis etc)\nstudent: I see, thanks\nstudent: no worries!!\nteacher: Yes so many little phrases for hello/goodbye i guess! which ones did you pick up?\nteacher: I was always say 'hasta luego' i think in Spanish and never anything else!\nteacher: I don't know if that matters or not really!\nstudent: Not many I think... For hello just hi or hello\nstudent: and for goodbye see you, bye (never goodbye, I don't know why)\nteacher: Yes sure well that's fine! 'alright?' is of course very common right?\nstudent: some people say just 'later'?\nteacher: um...'later' by itself is only used by some young people i would say....but possible yes (or 'laters' -= another form used by some young people....god this is making me feel old!)\nstudent: haha\nteacher: most common = seeya (as in pronounced like that i mean ...never see YOU if you see what i mean)\nstudent: and night for goodnight\nstudent: no sorry, I don't understand the explanation of 'seeya'\nteacher: Yes so your idea about 'goodbye' being unusual is correct  - 'bye' by itself = a thousand times more normal ...'goodbye' sounds very final/formal (weird!)\nteacher: So obviiously we say 'see you' and miss out the 'later ' at the end VERY often ...BUT many (most!) students pronounce the 'you' with a strong form of the vowel you know?\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: BUt we use the weak form (the 'schwa' remember?) and it sounds weird otherwise\nteacher: so in writing this is represented as 'ya'\nstudent: yes\nteacher: OK\nstudent: question: if we change the pronunciation, does the meaning change?\nteacher: Um...no sorry I didn't mean that ...hold on asec..\nstudent: Ahhh ok\nstudent: Ahhh ok\nteacher: So non-native don't use weak forms very much it' s true and it basically doesn't matter that much really BUT we do yes and it can change the meaning\nteacher: But we understand that if you use them/don't use them it's not changing the meaning because you only have one form!\nteacher: you see what  i mean?\nstudent: Yes I see\nstudent: Mr. Johnson : most common = seeya (as in pronounced like that i mean ...never see YOU if you see what i mean)\nteacher: OK! it's just taht for some reason the non-native failure to use the weak vowel in the phrase  'see ya' is particularly noticeable ... but it doesn't really matter!\nstudent: I got the idea of a different meaning after reading that sentence I copied above\nteacher: Yes i see what you mean - tricky to talk about pronunciation issues in this format!\nteacher: I do a lot of pronunciation normally in classes\nstudent: sure, again we miss the audio!\nteacher: yes oh well\nstudent: Then, you suggest that I don't use 'see ya'\nstudent: ??\nteacher: Oh no - it's fine !\nteacher: Keep using it no problem!\nstudent: ok\nteacher: HAve you noticed people saying alright' for 'hello'  a lot?\nstudent: no, never\nstudent: ahh yes\nteacher: Ah interesting! That's what i use very often ...\nstudent: but I thought it meant Are you alright?\nteacher: OK ..this is very common informally (not everyone uses it )\nteacher: Ah yes i see...it CAN mean this BUT it's just become so generuc\nteacher: generic...\nstudent: ahhh\nteacher: so the other person will just reply 'alright' - you see?!\nteacher: it's not a real question\nteacher: but you CAN answer it a real question if you like!\nstudent: I don't like it! Same in Spain... we could say 'qu\u00e9 tal?' instead of 'hola'\nteacher: as a real question i mean\nteacher: Yes i see...I always found it intimidating when Spanish people said e.g. Que pasa/que dices ....\nstudent: I don't like it because the person who is saying 'qu\u00e9 tal?' usually is not interested in if you are well or not\nteacher: like i had to have some interesting answer\nteacher: yes i see!\nteacher: What about 'cheers' for 'bye' ? Have you noticed that much?\nstudent: haha I don't think they are expecting an interesting answer... I think it's just a different way of saying hello\nteacher: OK that's a relief\nstudent: In Argentina it is worse\nteacher: ?\nstudent: they ask \u00bfqu\u00e9 haces? what are you doing?\nteacher: ok right...yes scary!\nstudent: so I used to explain what I was doing and they didn't care haha\nteacher: :)\nstudent: I used sorry, not anymore\nteacher: OK cheers Alexandra - have a good one and i'll speak to you on Thursday ok? see ya....\nstudent: Yes, thank you very much\nstudent: have a good one you too\nstudent: :)\nteacher: no probs",
    "teacher: Hi there Sophia...\nstudent: Good afternoon Mr. Johnson.\nteacher: OK? Did you a whole IELTS test today?\nstudent: I've just done Listening, Reading and Writing Task 1.\nstudent: did\nteacher: OK well that's a lot....how did it go?\nstudent: I got 6.5 on both listening and reading.\nteacher: OK well done! That's your target\nteacher: Did you check the answers you got wrong and understand why?\nstudent: I think it is the best score I've ever got.\nteacher: OK great! (try that sentence again Sophia - think about the grammar...)\nstudent: yes.. I think on listening I always have a problem with spelling and I can't catch the answers when it is so fast.\nstudent: I think it is the best score I've ever got.\nteacher: Yes I understand about the spelling....and the speed (just keep listening as much as you can to a variety of stuff to get better with that)\nstudent: for reading, I think I still need to practise the skills that you were teaching me.\nteacher: OK...you mean e.g. for paragraph headings and true/false questions etc\nstudent: I try to listen to BBC learning English every day and I write down what I heard as much as possible. I hope it can help me.\nteacher: Yes that's good - it will help you (but it takes time!) ....\nstudent: yes!! the principles of an English essay, they are the best skills which I have learned.\nteacher: OK good...Sophia look at this :   Yesterday I ran 5k in 16:40. Today I ran 5k in 16:20 and now i can say: My time was _________ than yesterday.'?\nteacher: What's the missing word?\nstudent: early\nteacher: So Usain Bolt is a _____ runner?\nteacher: possible word in the gap here?\nstudent: fastest\nstudent: fastest\nteacher: OK he's a fast runner. = correct   'HE is _____ than me.'\nteacher: answer?\nstudent: he is faster than me\nteacher: OK good thanks....Usain Bolt is the __________ runner in the world?\nstudent: fastest\nteacher: OK good thanks...so do this one again: Th Yesterday I ran 5k in 16:40. Today I ran 5k in 16:20 and now i can say: My time was _________ than yesterday.'? Sophia : What's the missing word?\nstudent: so... they are the best skills which I have learned.\nstudent: earlier\nteacher: OK yes good ...correct with 'the' first (before best)\nteacher: So the adjective you can use with time (for running for example) is good/fast ok?\nteacher: Oh sorry ...hold on\nteacher: so 16:40 = 16 minutes 40 seconds NOT 4 o'clock in the afternoon!\nteacher: OK?!\nteacher: So: Yesterday I ran 5k in 16:40. Today I ran 5k in 16:20 and now i can say: My time was _________ than yesterday.'?\nstudent: my time was shorter than yesterday.\nteacher: So the adjective you can use with time (for running for example) is good/fast ok?\nstudent: yes... so my time was faster than yesterday.\nteacher: OK great! my time was faster/quicker/better than yesterday! good\nteacher: OK so one more: My personal best for 5k is 15:03 (along time ago) ..... So 15:03 is the _____  I _______  ______ the 5k.??\nstudent: 15:03 is the fastest I have run the 5k.\nteacher: OK thanks so.... '15:03 is the fastest I _____  _____ the 5k.'  What tense do you need for the verb Sophia? Past simple/present continuous/present perfect?\nstudent: past perfect, because the result is important now.\nstudent: present perfect\nteacher: Yes great! Because the time is unfinished --- it inludes up to now (i am not dead/i still run) graet\nteacher: So therefore: '15:03 is the fastest I _____ _____ the 5k.'\nstudent: 15:03 is the fastest I have run the 5k\nteacher: yes ok good ('run' is irregular so the past participle is 'run' confusingly! but don't worry i can see you've got the right idea) )\nstudent: ok.. thanks\nteacher: OK Sophia so....i asked you these questions because of what you write earlier  - hold on ...i'll copy it and ask you to change it ok?...\nteacher: what you wrote earlier\nstudent: ok, thanks\nteacher: Ok so you said: 'I think it is my best score I done before.' Can you think about how you could try that again?!\nstudent: I think it is the best score I have ever got.\nteacher: OK good much better!\nstudent: I think it is the best score I have got.\nteacher: I think it is the best score I have (ever) got. ' = good (we usually use the verb 'get' for 'score'  (e.g. 'get 6.5' = correct)\nteacher: Yes better good\nteacher: So Sophia do you remember the space question?\nstudent: ok, thanks for helping me to correct some basic grammar mistakes.\nstudent: yes, I still remember.\nteacher: That's ok!\nteacher: so one idea about why space exploration was that it would be good to find life on other planets right?\nstudent: international cooperation\nteacher: Oh ok good yes we talked about that one too of course! Yes ok fine\nteacher: I know it can be difficult to think of ideas sometimes...\nteacher: One way to make it easier is to think of 'categories' you know?\nteacher: So there are diffferent topics of course BUT you can use similar categories to talk about them...\nstudent: and another one I think is that it can also improve our knowledge.\nteacher: For example: 'political/economic/moral' OK??\nteacher: Yes OK good idea - can you give me an example?\nstudent: for instance, we may explain the laws of nature\nteacher: You mean laws of nature I think right?\nteacher: like gravity for example or other types of physics\nstudent: like why there are 365 days in a year but sometimes there are 366 days\u3002\nteacher: So OK Sophia yes - this is a good idea and the CATEGORY here is 'scientific' right?\nteacher: As in increasing fundamental  scientific knowledge...\nstudent: 366.0\nstudent: like why there are 365 days in a year but sometimes there are 366 days.\nteacher: Yes understood!\nstudent: yes!! basic knowledge\nteacher: So the international co-operation idea was a POLITICAL category you caould say....Can i ask you to think about the ECONOMIC categeory in relation to this space question...do you think there are economic benefits to space exploration?\nteacher: Maybe? Does anything occur to you quickly? Don;t worry if you can't think of anything ...just tell me!\nstudent: yes... there are massive natural recourses.\nteacher: ok cool - good idea!\nteacher: Where are they for example?\nteacher: And what for example?\nstudent: on other planets or stones in space.\nteacher: yes ok .... big stones = rocks ...and big rocks in space = e.g. asteroids (difficult word i know!)\nteacher: and i guess on other planets too right?\nteacher: And an example of the resources you might find?\nstudent: yes, maybe on the Moon or Mars\nstudent: lunar\nteacher: yes good idea! so on THE moon or on Mars (planets in our solar system)\nteacher: and what kind of resources?\nstudent: we can find diamonds or other crystals\nstudent: or... oxygen and water\nteacher: ok fine yes so...maybe a good word might be precious metals ok?\nstudent: yes ..ok\nteacher: yes and e.g. oxygen/helium etc are 'elements' right?\nstudent: ok\nteacher: OK great Sophia so after the break I'll work with you to create a paragraph on this main idea ok?\nteacher: It's a good onefor this essay i think - nice and clear\nstudent: yes, I will finish it and hand it in to you after the break.\nteacher: ok great...bye for now!\nstudent: see you",
    "teacher: Hello!\nstudent: hi\nstudent: Another benefit of exploring space is that there are massive resources such as precious metals or helium and so on that we may find on asteroids and planets.\nteacher: OK thanks Sarah Smith - some good stuff there...have you already done more that's coming?\nstudent: no..\nteacher: No that's fine! That's great start...hold on a sec...\nteacher: a great start i mean\nstudent: as a consequence, a lack of resources on earth will be solved.\nteacher: Can i suggest a slightly more general sentence (a topic sentence) to start before we look at your words exactly....\nstudent: yes.. I need it\nteacher: Ah yes ... great idea to connect with the idea there yes welldone\nteacher: OK OK so....remember the 'category' here?\nteacher: POlitical?\nteacher: No! It's ________ benefits...?\nstudent: it is economic benefits.\nteacher: yes that's it (economic benefits)\nteacher: sorry internet problems!\nstudent: yes!! me too\nteacher: ok strange\nteacher: anyway so...let's just get this first topic sentence sorted out.....hold on\nstudent: ok\nteacher: Look at these two possible sentences coming up  Sarah Smith - can you complete the gaps? ! _________   _________ economic benefits to space exploration. OR  Space exploration _______ economic benefits.\nteacher: They are not 'difficult' words by the way!\nteacher: Just words to make simple but correct structures\nstudent: One of economic to space exploration. /   in\nteacher: Remember these two? London ____ many museums. OR _____  _____ many museums in London.\nstudent: wow.....\nstudent: sorry\nteacher: no problem!\nstudent: There are economic benefits to space exploration.\nteacher: Yes great! OR....\nstudent: space exploration has economic benefits.\nteacher: yes ok cool\nstudent: thanks\nteacher: Remember Sarah Smith, often we might want to say that these benefits are not exactly certain or they haven'y happened yet right?\nteacher: So a good word here might be 'potential' OK?\nteacher: So for example our first sentence could be: 'There are potential economic benefits to space exploration.'\nstudent: so.. there is economic potential to space exploration.\nteacher: Yes  - there is (singular) economic potential in space exploration = possible\nstudent: ok, thanks\nteacher: OK your idea before was 'a lack of resources' - let's try that now OK? hold on a sec\nstudent: ok\nteacher: Any ideas? Natural resources on Earth are ______- very quickly.  OR We are _____ Earths natural resources very quickly. '\nteacher: so a verb for each one if you can (different verb )\nstudent: used up\nstudent: supply\nstudent: demand\nteacher: OK nearly! 'Use UP' = good! for the second one\nstudent: rely on\nteacher: And the first one = 'running out/disappearing OK?\nstudent: yes,ok\nteacher: so the verbs 'supply' and 'demand' are nice verbs in many situations but the problem here is that you have 'very quickly' you see?\nteacher: So Sarah Smith WHY are these resources disappearing so quickly? (for example)\nstudent: humans waste them\nteacher: OK fine yes I am sure you're right!   How about the number of people on the planet?\nstudent: 16 billion?\nstudent: 1.6 billion I guess\nteacher: So for example: 'There are potential economic benefits to space exploration. Natural resources on Earth are running out because the number of people on the planet is increasing. ' OK??\nteacher: Your next idea was: there are massive resources and elements. such as precious metals or helium and so on where we may find them on asteroids and planets.\nstudent: yes!! I like it\nteacher: OK cool ...Let's have a quick think about this idea ... hold on....\nstudent: ok\nteacher: Any ideas for the gaps?? \u201cAsteroids and other planets ______  raw materials such as gold and other precious metals.\u201d   OR\u2026.\u201d ______  ______ raw materials such as gold and other precious metals on asteroids and other planets. \u201c\nstudent: have and there are\nteacher: OK great thanks\nteacher: have is OK .. contain would be good too right?\nstudent: thanks\nteacher: OK sothe resources are there ....and we have to _______ them? ?\nstudent: yes!! I really like this structure.\nteacher: OK!\nstudent: we have to save them\nteacher: Ah so the resources on Earth maybe yes! BUt the raw materials on asteroids? We want to develop the technology to 'ex_ _  _ _ _' them right?\nteacher: LIke a dentist with a bad tooth (do you know the word?!_ ... or another way to say it of you can think of one!\nteacher: Hey Sarah Smith...'extract' is good OK? Sorry - we're running out of time...\nstudent: explore\nteacher: ah ok not a bad idea!\nteacher: extract is best ok?!\nteacher: Sorry Sarah Smith we're coming to an end here - I took  too long I'm afraid ... hold on...\nstudent: yes..sorry, I try to send answers based on slow internet speed.\nteacher: So the point here Sarah Smith is that your orginal sentence ( Another benefit of exploring space is that there are massive resources and elements. such as precious metals or helium and so on where we may find them on asteroids and planets.) is the right idea but i would suggest you take a step back and make it a bit more step by step ok??\nstudent: yes, thanks\nteacher: I mean, !. There are benefits. 2. Earth's resouce are runnin out. 3. There are resources in space. 4. We can try to extract them ....You see what i mean?\nteacher: sorry about the spelling mistakes there!  but you understand the point?\nstudent: yes, I can understand\nteacher: OK  fine! I know it's hard when you don;t know all the words you want to use but just try and keep it as correct as possible\nteacher: Don;t worry if it isn't really 'academic' /'difficult' OK?\nstudent: ok, thanks I will remember these rules\nteacher: OK Sarah Smith so I guess that's it for these lessons - It was good to work with you and I wish you  the best of the luck with the exam...\nstudent: thanks very much, I am really happy to have had classes with you.\nteacher: OK no problem - all the best and I hope things get back to normal for you soon!\nteacher: Well done on all your hard work - stay positive and keep working hard!\nteacher: Bye!\nstudent: yes!! I hope so, everything can recover I believe.\nteacher: Hold on Sarah Smith - am i stopping early? I think I am right? We have another 10 minutes sorry!\nstudent: thanks for everything, best regards\nteacher: Sarah Smith if you're still there let me show you this paragraph : The potential economic benefits of space exploration are enormous. We are using up the Earth\u2019s natural resources at an alarming rate in order to support a growing world population. It is very likely that asteroids and even other planets contain huge amounts of raw materials. It will require a large investment to develop the technology to extract these resources and return them to Earth. Nevertheless, it is technically possible and ultimately in our own self-interest to fund such efforts.\nteacher: Are you there??\nteacher: OK sorry Sarah Smith I guess not :( .... over and out!",
    "teacher: Hi there Emily Smith...\nstudent: Hi Ms. Ramirez.\nteacher: I fear my internet might be a bit dodgy today but we'll hope for the best!\nstudent: Sorry, I'm late! It took me a few minutes to get here... My laptop is being very slow today\nteacher: Ah that's ok....I'm having a few little problems too!\nstudent: ah ok, no problem\nteacher: Hey Emily Smith...I think i might have mentioned to you the value of comments on internet forums etc for language learning?\nstudent: Not sure about it... tell me a bit more please\nteacher: OK...well I've been looking at some for French and I've just been reminded o f what a rich source they are  ...\nstudent: Do you recommend those forums to learn English?\nstudent: Those, sorry\nteacher: Well I think taht for a more advanced learner they are, as i say, a really rich source of spoken-style language\nteacher: they contain a huge amount of authentic idiomatic language for esample\nteacher: And i;ve been looking at some in English to think about English teaching and it's confirmed this idea\nstudent: It sounds very good\nstudent: I don't think we've talked about it before...\nstudent: could you mention the ones you know?\nteacher: But it's great because for example you get one youtube video and hundreds of comments and they all naturally use a whole range of language to describe the same thing you know? It's like a mini-corpus!\nteacher: Yes nothing special - I just mean on e.g. youtube videos or newspaper websites (where they have comment sections after opinion pieces for example)\nstudent: Ahh now I see what you mean\nteacher: I was thinking about Boris JOhnson coming out of intensive care after our previous discussion and i looked at the comments section on the youtube videos of his speech afterwards\nstudent: I thought you were talking about forums like wordreference.com forum\nteacher: Ah right .. no , just real stuff!\nstudent: I see\nteacher: Can i ask you to have a quick look at the youtube video now?\nstudent: Yes, sure... I like reading what English people write on my English friend's walls on facebook for example\nteacher: THe search terms you need are: 'It could have gone either way Boris Johnson Sky News - maybe just watch the first couple of minutes OK?\nstudent: Yes (about the video)\nstudent: I will watch it now\nteacher: Right yes...facebook is a good source i'm sure\nteacher: Ok!\nteacher: Actually, he starts thanking individuals after a couple of minutes which is quite funny!\nstudent: I watched the first 2 minutes\nstudent: yes, thanking everyone for not organising barbecues in the park\nteacher: OK! So you get the idea....he gets more personal later, thanking individual nurses etc (ironically they're immigrants!)\nteacher: I wonder Emily Smith - is this similar to what a Spanish politician would do?\nstudent: Yes I know, I saw him on the  Spanish news talking about his hero 'a Portuguese nurse'\nteacher: Ah right OK! Well anyway, I was looking at the comments section afterwards and i;ve edited some examples for you....\nstudent: great!\nteacher: here are the first 5 .... my quick overall question first is: Which one supports Boris?\nteacher: 1. Maybe this bugger can start doing his job now and clear up this mess - I'm glad he pulled through but come on! 2. It was only ever going to go one way lol 3. I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re ok Mr Johnson. I shouted \u201cYES!\u201d when I heard you were discharged from hospital. You\u2019re the best prime minister we have had. Caring, hardworking and selfless attitude in the midst of this crisis. Truly admirable. Please rest after your ordeal and watch some more movies and play video games! You deserve it. 4. You actually sound a bit more more human, and humble, for the first time. I hope that your close brush with death means you will, in the future, protect our precious NHS and other public services. 5. What a load of bollocks, knew he\u2019d recover straight away\nstudent: haha a variety of opinions\nteacher: Yes! Great though right? So much rich language ....\nteacher: And quite similar to real speaking a lot of it....\nstudent: Yes\nstudent: I didn't know you could use the word 'bugger' to call a person\nteacher: OK so as you can imagine most of the people posting comments are critical! Only one is unequivocally pro-Boris right? Yes...a bugger! A little bit old-fashioned perhaps (and not that rude any more)\nteacher: OK Emily Smith so a few language questions for you if you're ready...\nstudent: ahh good! I thought it was an expression, something like 'shit!'\nstudent: yes, I'm ready!\nteacher: Yes, you;re right ... it;s that too like if you;re hurt yourself/forget something for example (bit less rude than shit)\nstudent: I see\nteacher: Can you find a word/phrase in the 5 comments with the following meaning? They\u2019re in the right order by the way):   a) get better/not die! b) allowed to leave hospital  c) generous d) unpleasant and prolonged experience  e) brief contact with something unpleasant f) rubbish\nteacher: 1. Maybe this bugger can start doing his job now and clear up this mess - I'm glad he pulled through but come on! 2. It was only ever going to go one way lol 3. I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re ok Mr Johnson. I shouted \u201cYES!\u201d when I heard you were discharged from hospital. You\u2019re the best prime minister we have had. Caring, hardworking and selfless attitude in the midst of this crisis. Truly admirable. Please rest after your ordeal and watch some more movies and play video games! You deserve it. 4. You actually sound a bit more more human, and humble, for the first time. I hope that your close brush with death means you will, in the future, protect our precious NHS and other public services. 5. What a load of bollocks, knew he\u2019d recover straight away\nstudent: A) pull through\nteacher: OK great\nstudent: Not sure about the meaning of the second one... Does that person mean that being the prime minister he had to survive??\nteacher: Ah yes good question - this is a bit ambiguous....\nstudent: B)to be discharged from hospital (you taught me that one a few days ago ;)\nteacher: most neutral meaning = just chances are he wouldn't die statistically you know?\nstudent: yes, I get that person is being ironic, am I right? number 2\nteacher: Or maybe the person wanted him to die but was pessimistic about his wish coming true!\nteacher: Yes i think probably ironic yes\nteacher: Yes 'discharge' good recycing!\nstudent: c) selfless\nteacher: ok good\nstudent: d) ordeal (don't know this word)\nteacher: yes - I guessed this might be a new word\nstudent: ahh, I thought it was an old-fashioned word\nteacher: Right - I meant new for you by the way! Well, it's a bit more formal than some of the other words/phrases here but normal....\nstudent: e) close brush ( I like this one! brush like in toothbrush)\nteacher: Yes this is a good one - and normal! close shave = same meaning\nstudent: haha I understood it was a popular word nowadays\nteacher: Yes i guess...\nteacher: Actually close brush and close shave not totally the same i;ll come back to that in a bit...\nstudent: ok\nstudent: f) bollocks\nteacher: OK thanks! A bit vulgar obviously but very common!\nteacher: often 'rubbish;  in the sense of 'nonsense' rather than low-quality\nstudent: I see\nstudent: there is another very similar word I don't remember now, very common for the same thing\nteacher: Trying to think...'crap' maybe?\nstudent: ahhh bullshit, sorry if it is too rude, I don't know\nteacher: ok yes you;re right...no don't worry about being rude, it's all in the interests of science!  Not that rude anyway these days...\nteacher: By the way , in order of register it's the following: 1. rubbish 2. crap  3. shit\nteacher: Or various alternatives for each category obviously i.e. 1. nonsense 3. bollocks etc\nstudent: what do you mean?? from less rude to more rude??\nteacher: Yes exactly\nteacher: Do you have the word 'register' in Spanish to indicate formality/informality?\nstudent: Thank you! that's very useful... It's hard when you learn this kind of words\nstudent: I don't think we have a word 'register'\nteacher: YEs sure....it;s the use rather than the basic meaning which gets harder as you get more advanced of course...\nstudent: the problem I think is that you don't learn them at school, generally you pick them up from people\nteacher: OK well in linguistics it just means the variety of language you;re using (e.g. vocab/grammar/pronunciation) often measured in terms of formality\nstudent: So it's difficult to know if they are terrible or not\nteacher: High' register = more formal\nteacher: Yes i see - well, that's where you;re time actually spent in the UK is so useful i guess\nstudent: Yes, I think so\nteacher: Sorry Emily Smith , before i forget .... close brush WITH soemthing (often death!) whereas 'a close shave' basically comes after the dangerous thing (and bigger variety of things possible than with 'brush') has been mentioned...OK?!\nstudent: yes\nteacher: e.g. we nearly crashed! yes, it was a close shave.\nteacher: ok!\nstudent: I see, thanks\nteacher: Fancy having a look at another set of comments quickly?\nstudent: Sure!!\nteacher: ok hold on a sec\nteacher: 1. Let's hope that this has been an eye-opener for him, and he realises the NHS staff need better care in the future 2. It\u2019s reassuring to know, when this problem is over, our politicians will still feel so appreciative of the NHS and our other support services and translate their thanks into hard cash.  3. Jeez looks like he\u2019s lost two stone  4. I\u2019m happy for Boris no matter what your politics no one wishes anyone to die that way. Now you are better Boris give the nurses more money please. 5. You need to invest money and reopen Hemel hospital accident and emergency.\nteacher: Questions if you have time! : Who supports Boris the most?! Who has a complaint about a local problem? Who is the most sarcastic?  Who mentions his physical appearance?\nstudent: Number 3 talks about his physical appearance\nteacher: ok!\nstudent: Number 5 talks about a local problem\nteacher: yep\nstudent: the most sarcastic I think is number 2?\nteacher: YEs absolutely! Classic British example - i could have written that myself!\nstudent: haha\nstudent: nobody here seems to suport Boris\nstudent: but maybe number 4?\nteacher: Yes i guess 'support' is not quite the right word!\nteacher: I've reduced these ti be quick...\nteacher: a) something surprising that you learn from b) change something to a new form - especially a plan or something more abstract into something (more) real c) US = \u201cEmergency Room\u201d or \u201cER\u201d UK = \u201c  _______ and ______\u201d OR \u201c__ + __\u201d d) IF you want to ask someone if they are left-wing or right -wing you can ask: \u201cWhat are your _________.\u201d?\nstudent: well, this one said I'm happy\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: 1. Let's hope that this has been an eye-opener for him, and he realises the NHS staff need better care in the future 2. It\u2019s reassuring to know, when this problem is over, our politicians will still feel so appreciative of the NHS and our other support services and translate their thanks into hard cash.  3. Jeez looks like he\u2019s lost two stone  4. I\u2019m happy for Boris no matter what your politics no one wishes anyone to die that way. Now you are better Boris give the nurses more money please. 5. You need to invest money and reopen Hemel hospital accident and emergency.\nteacher: Can you manage those in a few mintues?! see how you go....\nstudent: No, that's too hard for 2 minutes\nstudent: sorryyy\nteacher: OK I'll leave them with you  for next time OK?\nstudent: Yes, please!!\nstudent: thank you very much again!\nteacher: OK no problem speak to you on Tuesday - have a good one!\nstudent: You too!! bye\nteacher: bye",
    "teacher: Hi Sophia Williams...\nstudent: Hi Ms. Rodriguez\nteacher: Feels like a while since I spoke to you - how's it going?\nstudent: Yes, it feels like that\nstudent: I'm alright, it seems we are going to start going out soon... So happy about it\nstudent: how about you?\nteacher: Yes I can imagine - I wonder what it will be like?\nteacher: I mean will things feel different for a while?\nteacher: Yes I'm fine thanks - to be perfectly honest I'm quite a self-contained person (well that's one word for it!) so the whole lockdown thing has not really affected me that much\nstudent: Yes, definitely! We'll be able to go for walks around our place but keeping a distance... so not normal at all\nteacher: My leg's made progress and that's the thing that was bothering me so I'm happy ...hooray for me!   Ah yes of course you'll still have to keep your/a distance\nstudent: That's good (that you're happy at home). Me too, I'm ok, I just miss feeling free to go wherever I want and meet people at least sometimes haha\nteacher: When you say our 'place' you mean your house? (This is the normal (informal) meaning of (our/my 'place')\nstudent: Great news about your leg!!!\nteacher: I was pessimistic about my leg because i've had sports injuries before that didn't get better without surgery but seems like i've been lucky this time\nstudent: yes, I mean 'we will be able to walk around our houses' Is it correct the use of 'place' in that case??\nteacher: But I might take it down a bit/play it safe ... a bit more swimming/cycling (nice and safe!)\nteacher: Yes it's possible\nteacher: but a bit weird...um... why? hold on...\nstudent: Ohh fantastic, it's a really bad time for a surgery right now... I also have an injury at the moment, have I told you about it?\nteacher: Oh no! No, go ahead tell me...\nstudent: I have tendonitis (is it right?) in my right shoulder. It is very painful... I've had it for over 6 months I think and it just gets worse...\nteacher: Oh I'm sorry that's bad..(tendonitis with an 'o' because of the word 'tendon' you know?) - is it because of an activity you do?\nstudent: It's very uncomfortable especially at nighttime lying in bed, so I haven't been able to sleep well for 6 month... Last week I called my doctor and I went to get a sonography because I thought that something was broken\nstudent: But luckily it's just bad tendonitis ;)\nstudent: I need rehabilitation but it's not happening at the moment because of the COVID19 situation.. I'm just doing exercises at home and taking a lot of pills (which I hate)\nstudent: That is my drama jajaja\nteacher: Yes sometimes a (little!) simple break can  be easier to deal with right? OK so 'just' tendonitis (no 'a' = uncountable) - yes the same for me , i;ve been doing exercises for my knee sent to me online by physios\nteacher: I have to say that after my previous injuries orthopedic surgeons and physios have become like gods to me!\nstudent: Ohh sorry, you asked me about the cause... not sure about it! stress generally affects my shoulders and also I used to play the drums and maybe that was the origin\nstudent: haha yes, I understand what you mean. I need to find my god\nteacher: Right ... so kind of a recurring thing unfortunately...i guess playing the drums could trigger it right? Drums as in full drum kit? Or like bongos or something?\nstudent: Yes sometimes a (little!) simple break can be easier to deal with right? I'm not sure about the meaning of this sentence...\nteacher: I meant a broken bone - as in it;s easier to fix and can heal more quickly than a ligament injury for example\nstudent: I wrote drums because I don't know the right word, I'll try to explain it\nteacher: ok...\nstudent: I meant a broken bone - as in it's easier to fix and can heal more quickly than a ligament injury for example/ Sure, I was kind of (stupidly) disappointed when the doctor said that it wasn't a torn muscle or something like that\nteacher: Yes that's normal I guess - well, be disciplined with any exercises and I'm sure you can control it\nstudent: The drums thing.... I was playing different percussion instruments in a samba band (timba, repique, tam).  I started playing in Cambridge in Soul City Revival, have you ever seen them in the streets? (by the way, not sure about the use of some time)\nteacher: Yes I know the band - I know Emily Walker who was part of the set up ... that's great. 'some time' a bit weird here actually...\nteacher: Basically we'd say have you  'ever' seen\nteacher: also, remember a common difference between 'any' and 'some' in questions?\nteacher: E.g. what's the difference here: 'Have you got some carrots?'   versus  'Have you got any carrots?'\nstudent: I don't know Emily Walker , there were so many people there 10 years ago... I went back last November, there were people from 10 years ago still playing. I really love that band, much nicer than the one I used to be part of here\nstudent: Yesss!! Ever, thanks\nteacher: In one of them you don't know if they have any or not and in the other you expect/know they do have some...\nteacher: Yes it's still going strong!\nstudent: about 'some' and 'any', I thought that we have to use 'any' for negatives and questions... As a rule\nteacher: Yes that's what people learn and it's a good (very) general rule BUT we do often ask questions with 'some' ...\nteacher: because often we know the answer you know?\nteacher: and here we usually use 'some'\nteacher: But not in 'real' questions normally\nstudent: I see, good to know that it's right because sometimes I use it\nteacher: OK!\nteacher: Do you play any other musical instruments?\nstudent: I used to play the guitar (or without the) but now I can't because I have something bad on my right index finger called capsulitis... again I don't know the origin and doctors say that it's normal...\nstudent: maybe better right index finger\nstudent: I feel like an old lady talking about my health problems haha\nstudent: Do you play any musical instruments?\nteacher: Well...I played the guitar for many years from the age of 14 or so ...\nteacher: but  I kind of gave up as i got stuck in a rut\nteacher: and possible had limited musical talent!\nteacher: I could impress a  beginner but I'm not a natural!\nteacher: My sense of rhythm is weirdly flawed\nstudent: I'm sure you know much more than me. I learnt by myself, I couldn't impress anyone haha\nteacher: By the way 'guitar possible with or without 'the' but more normal with - maybe that's a British thing but don't take my word for that right now!\nstudent: ok\nstudent: What about 'place'? from the beginning...\nstudent: I can walk around my place, does it sound weird?\nteacher: Ha! Well my dad was/is (but retired now) quite a talented musician so i kind of got into it but never really measured up - i think i got a bit disillusioned with the difference!\nteacher: Um...so the 'place' thing maybe sounds weird because we basically use my place wen we say e.g. let's have a party at my place etc....\nteacher: and we just don't normally say e.g. walk around my place referring to it as a physical object in that way I guess\nstudent: Ha! Well my dad was/is (but retired now) quite a talented musician so i kind of got into it but never really measured up - i think i got a bit disillusioned with the difference!/I understand what you felt or feel... What does he play??\nstudent: I see (about place) so I should stop using place so happily jaja\nteacher: Well that's the thing I guess - he can play the piano/violin/guitar/harmonica ... all to a high standard   poor me!\nstudent: WOWWWW\nteacher: Yes - he's very self-disciplined you know - always practised for many hours a day..\nstudent: Yes, poor you and lucky you at the same time. I'd have loved to grow up in a house with a musician\nteacher: and just has that musical ability that i don't have in the same way!\nteacher: Yes well ... i have certainly always loved music\nteacher: and i;m grateful for having been exposed to lots of different kinds\nteacher: I enjoy sharing a wide variety of stuff with my daughter now\nstudent: But was he disillusioned by your 'lack of ability' or was it just you?\nteacher: It's always cool seeing kids read/listen to/see cool stuff for the first time you know?\nteacher: No he was actually very patient/encouraging/relaxed -  it was me!\nteacher: I am an impatient person!\nteacher: I need short-term goals or I go crazy\nstudent: It's always cool seeing kids read/listen to/see cool stuff for the first time you know?/ Yes, I can imagine!! it's good if she enjoys the thing that you consider 'cool stuff'. I don't have children, I have a nephew and we are very different (even me and my sister) so I can't generally experience that because when I show him something I think is cool he is not interested :(\nstudent: I need short-term goals or I go crazy/ hahaha musical instruments are not exactly for short-term goals\nteacher: Yes I suppose that sharing stuff with kids doesn't always work! Well, i'm starting to see the first glimmer of adolescence coming so  i can imagine that soon she'll start hating anything i like just on principle...\nstudent: haha yes, sadly people say that phenomenon always occurs so hurry up, show her as many cool things as you can now!!\nteacher: Yes, I figure that anything you do is worth it - even if it doesn't seem like it at the time - so your nephew might like those things at some point!\nteacher: But it's funny how different people can be from each other isn't it?\nteacher: I mean funny peculiar not funny ha ha\nstudent: Yes, I think so. I was about to tell you the same. Even when she starts saying that your stuff is boring, she will see it and maybe take it... (not sure if I made myself clear)\nstudent: Yes, funny peculiar indeed... I love my family but we are very different\nteacher: Um...you mean even if she hadn't liked it at first she might end up liking it?\nteacher: or .. even if she starts not liking my stuff she might end up ....\nstudent: not sure that's the idea, I mean that even if she says 'I don't like it' you could keep showing good things to her\nstudent: because at least she will be exposed to nice things and maybe she doesn't like them just because she is a teenager\nstudent: Ohh it's time! I will really miss our classes/conversations\nteacher: OK right - I think it was when you wrote 'even when' I got confused...Yes OK Sophia Williams , well it was good to work with you on this site and I wish you all the best\nstudent: THANK YOU VERY VERY VERY MUCH for your time and patience\nstudent: Me too, wish you all the best!!\nteacher: That's OK you're welcome - you;re a great language learner so congratulations on your English  and I hope you can carry on learning! OK cheers bye\nstudent: Thank you, I think you are a really good teacher!  Bye bye.\nteacher: :)",
    "student: Hi\nteacher: Hi Emily Smith!\nteacher: I like your username\nteacher: :)\nstudent: Thanks)\nteacher: Do you actually love pancakes?\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: Me too! What kind of pancakes are your favourite?\nstudent: With syrup\nteacher: Ah, sounds good!\nstudent: But I don\u2019t eat them as often as I want to\nteacher: Haha, I understand, me neither!\nstudent: They are not healthy\nteacher: Not terribly healthy, no\nteacher: Is chatting in English a new experience to you?\nstudent: Not really\nstudent: I chat with my friend from the USA\nteacher: Ok, great!\nteacher: And how are you today? Is it a nice day in Kyiv?\nstudent: Yes, it is\nteacher: I do miss Kyiv in the summer!\nstudent: It is hot outside\nteacher: It's very hot here today, by English standards. +29\nstudent: Wow\nstudent: I am okay, but I don\u2019t know what to do\nteacher: What do you mean?\nstudent: Like\nteacher: Are you a bit confused about this lesson? or generally, you are not sure what to do with your time?\nstudent: Because of the quarantine, I can\u2019t go anywhere\nstudent: So I am sitting at home\nstudent: And it is terrible\nteacher: Ah, I'm with you. I have to stay at home, too!\nteacher: Oh sorry to hear that!\nteacher: What would you normally do if it wasn't for the quarantine?\nstudent: That\u2019s fine\nstudent: I want to see my grandma\nstudent: She lives in Israel\nteacher: Oh I see, and the quarantine is very strict in Israel, isn't it? I know because my uncle lives there\nstudent: Yes it is\nstudent: Usually at this time me and my mom are there\nteacher: I see! Such a shame\nstudent: A big part of my family are there and I miss them so much:(\nteacher: That's too bad, this year has been really difficult in this respect!\nstudent: I hate 2020(\nteacher: Yes, a very weird year...\nstudent: 2019 and 2017 were the best!!!\nteacher: Oh really? What was special about them?\nstudent: In 2019 I traveled to Italy for the first time and I traveled to Israel 2 times\nteacher: Sounds great!\nstudent: In 2017 I finished the 4th grade, the people in my class were the best, and since the 5th grade there are mostly different people in my class\nstudent: I miss my old class, because now most of the people are toxic:(\nstudent: Where are you ?\nteacher: I see, what a shame! I can relate to this, sometimes new classes /  teams are just not the same\nstudent: Now there are some people from my old class, but they are strange to me\nteacher: I live in England, near Cambridge. You know how England is divided into counties? Our county is called Cambridgeshire\nstudent: Wow\nstudent: I didn\u2019t know that\nteacher: Yes, similar to oblast' in Ukraine\nstudent: Ah yea\nstudent: I understand now\nteacher: And a lot of the times, the names of counties are the name of the main city + shire\nteacher: Cambridge + shire = Cambridgeshire\nstudent: Easy to remember\nteacher: Gloucester + shire = Gloucestershire\nteacher: What do you think is the name of the county where York is?\nstudent: To be honest, I am very bad at geography\nstudent: Yorkshire\nteacher: Correct!\nteacher: So, Emily Smith, I thought of a game that you might have played at IH before. I will give you the names of 4 things that have some kind of connection to my life, and you ask me yes/no questions to establish what the connection is. How does it sound?\nstudent: It is similar to the name of the type of a dog\nteacher: Of course, that's right! Yorkshire terriers :)\nstudent: It sounds interesting\nteacher: I just googled, and they were actually bred in Yorkshire in the 19th century\nteacher: Ok, great. So here are my 4 things\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: 1. March  2. Shanghai  3. Bubble and Squeak 4. Little Women\nstudent: What is Squeak?\nteacher: Only yes/ no questions :)\nstudent: I know, but I don\u2019t understand what it means...\nstudent: Were you born in March?\nteacher: Oh, I see. Squeak is a sound that a mouse might make, or a squeaky door\nteacher: I was, correct!\nstudent: thanks for the explanation\nteacher: That was easy :) But also, the town where I live is called March\nstudent: Wow\nstudent: Okay\nteacher: I know, I was very pleased when we found a house here because it's my birth month\nstudent: Have you ever been to Shanghai?\nteacher: Yes, that was easy too!\nteacher: I lived there for a bit\nstudent: Do you speak Chinese?\nteacher: I learnt a little bit of Mandarin at the time, but I have unfortunately forgotten most of it. Hieroglyphs were very hard for me!\nstudent: I see what you mean\nstudent: The next questions are difficult...\nteacher: I'm glad, you've been cracking my quiz so far!\nstudent: Bubbles and Squeak\nstudent: Hmmm\nstudent: I don\u2019t even know what to ask\nstudent: It seems very illogical to me\nteacher: Well, you can see that the words are capitalized, so they must be...\nstudent: Names!\nteacher: yes!\nstudent: Are they your pets names?\nteacher: Yes!!\nstudent: Dog and mouse?\nteacher: They are my two guinea pigs :)\nstudent: Oh\nstudent: That\u2019s also cool:)\nteacher: Generally, bubble-and-squeak is a traditional English dish\nstudent: Really?\nteacher: You know how traditionally English people have a roast on Sundays?\nstudent: Tell me more about it, please\nstudent: No\nteacher: Some roast meat / chicken (or a nut roast if you are vegetarian / vegan) and some roasted vegetables\nteacher: Potatoes, carrots, parsnips etc.\nstudent: Okay\nteacher: If you have a huge meal and have some food left for the next day, what do you usually call this food?\nteacher: Do you know the word?\nstudent: No\nteacher: Leftovers!\nteacher: Or leftover food\nteacher: So, next day, people gather the leftovers and pour some batter over them and bake them in the oven, and they get bubble-and-squeak\nstudent: I\u2018ve never heard that word before\nstudent: Okay, thanks\nstudent: Little Women\nteacher: Our guinea pigs are adopted, and they already had their names when they came to us, but we liked the names and kept them\nteacher: Go on!\nstudent: Do you have two daughters?\nteacher: No! But good guess\nstudent: Hmmm\nstudent: Are you very short, like most of your family?\nteacher: Mmm, I'm not sure I understand that. What do you mean?\nstudent: You are not tall\nstudent: That\u2019s what I mean\nteacher: Ah, I see, no! Good guess again, but I'm actually pretty tall\nstudent: Help me\nstudent: Please\nteacher: Ok! :) Little Women was the last film I saw at the cinema, just before the lockdown!\nstudent: Aawww\nteacher: :)\nstudent: That was difficult!\nteacher: It was, yes! But well done!\nstudent: I didn\u2019t know that such a film even existed\nstudent: Thanks:)\nteacher: Would you like to create a similar quiz for me now? Think of 4 things that have a connection with your life, and I'll try to guess\nstudent: Okay\nteacher: Ok, take a couple of minutes if you want\nstudent: Give me some time\nteacher: Sure\nstudent: 1.Summer 2.White dog 3.Crisps 4.TOP\nstudent: That\u2019s it\nteacher: Hmm, interesting!\nteacher: Have you got a white dog?\nstudent: Nope\nteacher: Are you afraid of white dogs?\nstudent: No\nstudent: I love doggies:)\nteacher: Me too :)\nteacher: Hmm, I'll have a think about that later\nteacher: Do you love crisps?\nstudent: Yes, but that\u2019s not the answer :)\nteacher: Fair enough\nteacher: Can you cook crisps?\nstudent: No\nstudent: Need help?\nteacher: Just a little hint?\nstudent: Before the lesson I...\nteacher: You ate crisps!\nteacher: ?\nstudent: No, but you are close to the answer\nteacher: You stroked a white dog?\nteacher: You opened a packet of crisps?\nstudent: The hint was about crisps\nstudent: Hint : money\nteacher: Ok, did you count every crips in the packet because you were bored?\nteacher: Did you sell crisps to earn some pocket money?\nstudent: No, but it is a funny guess\nteacher: I give up!\nstudent: I ... some crisps today\nstudent: Sure?\nteacher: Did you eat them?\nstudent: No\nteacher: Did you spill them on the flour?\nteacher: floor, sorrry\nteacher: sorry\nstudent: I didn\u2019t open them!\nteacher: Ah, you have some willpower!\nstudent: Willpower ?\nstudent: Okay, so you give up?\nteacher: Yes, it's a character trait that means people can keep doing something hard or can resist doing something they want to\nteacher: I give up! But wasn't the answer 'you didn't open them'?\nstudent: No\nstudent: I bought them this morning!\nteacher: Ah I see!!\nstudent: Do you need help with the white dog?\nteacher: You know what, our time's running out, so how about we finish the quiz next time. I want to solve the mystery of the white dog!\nstudent: It is interesting to guess\nstudent: I copied the 4 facts\nteacher: So, back to willpower. We can say, 'It takes a lot of willpower to go to the gym every day' or 'She has a lot of willpower, she hasn't eaten the packet of crisps she bought this morning'\nteacher: Does it make sense?\nstudent: Yeah\nstudent: When will we meet here next time?\nteacher: Apart from willpower, have there been any other new words you'd like to remember from today? Feel free to look in the chat\nstudent: Wait a minute\nteacher: Does 9.30 am on Tuesday sound good to you?\nstudent: Let\u2019s talk about it on Skype, okay?\nteacher: Ok\nstudent: Squeak\nteacher: Aha, yes\nteacher: The food that's left from yesterday?\nstudent: But I know what it means now\nstudent: Leftover\nteacher: leftover food (leftover is an adjective here) or leftovers (plural noun)\nstudent: Am I right?\nteacher: Yes!\nstudent: So 3 words\nteacher: For example, I sometimes have leftovers for lunch\nteacher: And a part of England?\nstudent: Makes sense\nteacher: like Yorkshire or Cambridgeshire\nstudent: County\nteacher: Yes, well done!\nstudent: Thanks:)\nteacher: It's pronounced /'kaunti/\nstudent: I know that\nstudent: So thank you for the lesson\ud83d\ude03\nteacher: Ok, Emily Smith, it was lovely to talk to you (your English is great!), have a nice weekend, see you next week!\nteacher: You are very welcome\nstudent: Bye!\nteacher: Bye!",

You have to queue outside while social distancing\nteacher: I buy things online\nstudent: oh, I understand\nstudent: I don't like online shopping\nteacher: Oh really? why not?\nstudent: when you buy food online, the food that is delivered is not the freshest\nteacher: Oh I see, yes, I know in Kyiv supermarkets don't really do deliveries\nstudent: when you buy clothes, they can suit you or not, maybe the size isn't correct\nstudent: and then you wait again for a long time\nstudent: No, they do!\nstudent: not all of them\nteacher: Food can be out of date / past it's best, or it can be - (the opposite)?\nteacher: sorry, 'past its best'\nstudent: worst\nteacher: If the food is really nice, just picked or cooked, it's ...\nstudent: fresh?\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: not 'new', right? :)\nstudent: yea\nteacher: And if the food from yesterday is still in the fridge, it's ____ food\nstudent: refrigerated?\nteacher: A word from last class!\nstudent: I don't understand...\nteacher: Remember we learnt a word that describes the food saved from the previous day?\nteacher: Left....?\nstudent: yes,leftover food\nteacher: Yes, correct!\nteacher: or leftovers\nteacher: Another word from before: what's the sound that a mouse makes?\nstudent: squeak\nteacher: Yes, correct!\nteacher: There's an expression in English, 'A squeaky wheel gets the grease'\nteacher: What do you think it means?\nstudent: what does 'grease' mean?\nteacher: It's the oil that we can use on a wheel to stop the squeak\nstudent: oh , okay\nstudent: so I think it means that everyone who needs help will always get it?\nteacher: Ah, good idea! Close!\nteacher: It means that people who talk about their problems will get the help\nteacher: and people who are quiet will not\nstudent: okay\nteacher: it's a bit negative\nstudent: ?\nteacher: e.g. My colleague got a new desk because he always complains about his back. Now, my back's hurting too but I never complain. I guess a squeaky wheel gets the grease!\nteacher: (imaginary situation)\nteacher: ok?\nstudent: yeAh, I understand\nteacher: Ok, next word!\nteacher: There is a virus out there, and people have to stay at home and lots of places are closed. What's this situation called?\nstudent: quarantine\nteacher: Yes, correct spelling, thank you!\nteacher: When everything was stopped in the UK, it was called a lockdown\nteacher: only essential shopping, no going out etc.\nteacher: Great, and one last word from the previous class.\nteacher: Control over our actions that we use to keep doing something hard\nstudent: willpower?\nteacher: yes, well done!\nteacher: Do you think willpower is important?\nstudent: of course it is\nteacher: Do you think you have a lot of it?\nstudent: I think 60/40\nteacher: How do you know?\nstudent: who was that?\nteacher: I wonder that\nteacher: It could have been Anna Kim from your class. He's having a class tomorrow, so he might have tried the chatroom\nteacher: Anyway, they left now\nstudent: Anna Kim told me there aren't any places anymore\nteacher: Yes, I told him we stopped recruiting while we were waiting for the form to be approved, but then I wrote back to him and invited him\nteacher: Are you thinking about willpower? Or waiting for me to say something?\nteacher: It's a bit hard to tell because I can't see whether you're typing\nstudent: I was waiting while you were saying something about it\nstudent: so willpower\nteacher: Ah, no worries\nteacher: Go on\nstudent: I am sometimes too lazy to do something\nteacher: Some psychologists today believe it's not a thing!\nteacher: Willpower is a made-up construct.\nstudent: ?\nteacher: For example, the reason I don't have a packet of crisps for lunch is not my amazing willpower but my concern over my health\nstudent: oh\nteacher: The reason a person might study hard is because they want to learn something / want to achieve the social status that studying hard can give them\nteacher: etc.\nstudent: these are my reasons\nteacher: And the reason many diets don't work is becausea no one has enought willpower. Because it's not a thing!\nteacher: What do you think?\nstudent: I don't know what to say\nstudent: ...\nteacher: Ok, no worries. Just something to think about\nteacher: Shall we go back to your quiz?\nteacher: The white dog!\nstudent: yessss!!!!\nteacher: I have an idea, actually.

I'd like you to watch a short video of the so-called 'marshmallow test'. Do you know what it is?\nstudent: no\nteacher: Do you know 'marshmallow'?\nstudent: DJ?\nteacher: Probably :)\nstudent: yes\nteacher: But originally it's a yummy dessert, similar to Ukrainian 'zefir'\nstudent: I know\nstudent: it is tasty\nteacher: You will see the rest in the video! It's to do with the idea of willpower!\nstudent: but they are not similar!\nteacher: Ok, now, would Thursday 10 am suit you?\nteacher: No, zefir is better!\nstudent: I think yes\nstudent: marshmallows are better:)\nteacher: Great, I'll send you the link then, have a lovely day!\nteacher: Nooo, zefir is better :)\nstudent: thank you , bye!!!\nteacher: Bye Anna Kim :)",

Which book did you use with Ms. Rodriguez?\nstudent: Live beat 4\nteacher: Aha, thanks for this\nstudent: You're welcome\nteacher: Alexis, I thought of a quick game to get to know each other, you might know this one from IH. It's called 2 truths one lie. Does it ring a bell?\nstudent: I'm not sure if we played this game\nstudent: Or maybe I forgot\nteacher: No problem.

They are not real pigs!\nteacher: They are small pet animals, a bit bigger than a hamster but not as big as a rabbit\nteacher: They are not expensive :)\nstudent: I think that number 3 is a lie\nteacher: Nope, numbers 1 and 3 are true!\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: I don't live in Cambridge, though. I live in a little town called March, it takes about 30 minutes to get to Cambridge by train\nstudent: So is it my turn now?\nteacher: My husband and I both work in Cambridge, but I work from home and, before the quarantine, he used to...

Dog name is Gerda\nteacher: Well, well, number 1 certainly sounds true\nteacher: But, as you say you don't grow many crops, I think you have a swimming pool instead of a tractor!\nteacher: Am I right?\nstudent: So you think that number 3 is a lie?\nteacher: yes!\nstudent: You're right!\nteacher: Yay!\nteacher: Do your family grow some fruit and vegetables, though?\nstudent: Aha\nteacher: Which ones are your favourite?\nstudent: Vegetables?\nteacher: yes\nteacher: or fruit\nstudent: Tomato\nteacher: Ah, I miss Ukrainian tomatoes, they are the best!\nteacher: Alexis, how do you like a 'chat' lesson?

The process of exploring (e.g. how the language works)\nstudent: okay\nteacher: Ok. Imagine we found a dog in the street.

And you answer, 'No, it's eaten the whole bowl, it ____ ____ hungry anymore!'\nstudent: can't be?\nteacher: Excellent!\nteacher: If we are very sure something is true, we use must + infinitive\nteacher: And if we are sure something is not true, we use can't + infinitive\nstudent: yes, I remember this\nteacher: could / might / may work for everything in between\nteacher: excellent\nteacher: https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/grammar/intermediate-to-upper-intermediate/modals-deductions-about-the-present\nteacher: could you click on this link and do Grammar Test 1?

We use the past infinitive, which is have + past participle\nstudent: okay\nteacher: but the modals are the same\nteacher: I didn't tell him anything. He ___ ____ ___ about his surprise party.

She _____ misunderstood me.\nstudent: might have\nteacher: and if we are very sure?\nstudent: must have\nteacher: she did the wrong page after all!\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: excellent :)\nstudent: yay\nteacher: They are called modals of deduction, and, in my opinion, they are very cool to use and they show off your English much better than using 'maybe'\nteacher: Do you know 'deduction'?\nstudent: not really\nteacher: If you 'deduce' something, you use the evidence to understand what might have happened in the past\nstudent: evidence?\nteacher: I'll give you an example. He came back from winter holidays all suntanned, and I deduced that he must have travelled to a warm country\nteacher: Him being suntanned is the evidence, and what I thought is my deduction\nstudent: okay\nteacher: It's the method that Sherlock Holmes used! Deduction\nstudent: aaaahhh\nteacher: and possibly other detectives as well\nteacher: does it make sense now?\nstudent: yep\nteacher: great\nteacher: Ok, let's make some deductions then!\nteacher: She came home really upset. What do you think might have happened?\nteacher: My guess: She must have had a bad day!\nstudent: She might have had a fight with her friend\nteacher: Cool, can you look at my example and see which word got lost in yours?\nstudent: had\nteacher: Yes! Maybe she had a fight = she might have had a fight\nteacher: Good one! what else?\nstudent: Her boss might have fired her\nteacher: yes, great!\nteacher: Someone might have stolen her wallet\nstudent: She might have had a bad mark\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: The canteen might have been out of her favourite food\nstudent: She might have eaten something not fresh and now she might have a stomachache\nteacher: excellent, combining past and present, well done!\nstudent: nice to hear that:)\nteacher: Ok, cool! Did you have a chance to watch the marshmallow test video?\nstudent: yes\nstudent: I watched it when you sent it\nteacher: Lovely! Could you tell me what happens in a few words?\nstudent: so it is a test, two kids are given a marshmallow, if they wait until dad (I think) comes back, they will get more, if they eat their marshmallow, they won't get another one\nteacher: Exactly!\nteacher: This test was first done in the 1960s, and the researches went on to follow the lives of these children, and they found out that kids who didn't eat the marshmallow were more successful in life than those who did\nstudent: wow\nstudent: that's interesting\nteacher: They did better at school and went on to good universities and have better jobs\nteacher: Yes, that's what people thought, wow!\nteacher: People thought, ah, we just need to teach kids some self-control\nteacher: What's another word for it? from the last class?\nstudent: willpower?)\nteacher: Yes!\nteacher: So, a bit of willpower, and kids will be super successful!\nteacher: Do you think it worked?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: No! :))\nstudent: why?\nteacher: because human beings are way more complex than that\nteacher: You know how in science it's very important that the results of a study be replicated?\nstudent: yes, it's very important\nteacher: yes, so scientists did more and more marshmallow tests and followed the lives of the kids, and they did not get the same results as the original study\nteacher: There could have been other factors at play. Not just willpower. And maybe not willpower at all.\nteacher: For example, the kids might have been not hungry!\nstudent: okay\nteacher: What else might have been a factor?\nstudent: they don't like marshmallows?\nteacher: exactly! could you make a nice modal-of-deduction sentence, please?\nstudent: they might not like the marshmallow\nteacher: Aha, and in the past? when the test took place?\nstudent: they might not have liked the marshmallow\nteacher: They might have not liked the marshmallow\nteacher: They might have preferred chocolate :)\nstudent: yes\nstudent: maybe:)\nteacher: what else could have happened?\nstudent: they might have had an allergy to sweets (\nteacher: yes, good idea! They might have known they couldn't eat it\nteacher: I think they might have wanted to please the researchers\nteacher: or, to the contrary, they might have not wanted to listen to a lady / gentleman who they didn't know\nteacher: what do you think?\nstudent: could be\nteacher: The big criticism of the marshmallow test was that there were poorer and richer kids\nteacher: How do you think rich kids might have reacted?\nstudent: they might have eaten it\nstudent: I think\nteacher: why?\nstudent: I don't know\nteacher: well, rich kids had lots of sweets and toys anyway\nteacher: so it was easier for them not to eat the marshmallow\nstudent: maybe because they knew that their parents could buy them everything they want to\nteacher: Exactly!\nteacher: one marshmallow wasn't important to them\nteacher: now, not surprisingly, rich kids then went to better schools and could pay for good universities and have good jobs afterwards\nteacher: but it was a different story for poor kids\nstudent: they might have not been able to buy marshmallows\nteacher: And this is how the famous marshmallow test was debunked! Debunk = prove that something is not true\nteacher: Yes, that's right!\nteacher: That's it for today, Jessie Smith, it was a pleasure! Small homework: could you look up the pronunciation of the new words (exploration, evidence, deduce, deduction and debunk)?\nteacher: I think if you google them, you can listen to how they are pronounced\nstudent: okay\nteacher: Great, how about Tuesday 10 am then?\nstudent: can you type it in Skype, please?\nteacher: sure\nteacher: Have a lovely day!\nstudent: okay, if something changes, I will tell you!\nstudent: Goodbye!\nteacher: Bye!",
    "teacher: Morning Sophia Williams\nstudent: Good morning!\nteacher: We still have a couple of minutes before the class starts, I didn't realize :)\nteacher: And we can start! How are you today?\nstudent: I'm fine. And you?\nteacher: Fine, thank you! Just a bit annoyed with the weather\nteacher: How's your holiday going?\nstudent: It's cool. I don't need to do homework!\nteacher: Haha, I can imagine!\nteacher: What are you doing on holiday then?\nstudent: I swim in the swimming pool, play video games, play board games with my cousins, read books, play table tennis\nteacher: Sounds perfect!\nteacher: I'm going to take a week off at some point in July, but my husband and I are not sure what to do! Lots of places are still closed\nteacher: So it might be a 'staycation'. Do you know this word?\nstudent: No, I don't\nteacher: You know 'vacation', another word for holiday? More American\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: vacation + stay (at home) = staycation\nteacher: A holiday when you stay at home!\nstudent: Understand\nteacher: Is the quarantine still going strong in Ukraine?\nteacher: Oh, feel free to ask me any questions, new words or anything, ok?\nstudent: The government opened the underground but now it closed again\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: Closed again? Why is that?\nstudent: Because we have new anti-record of Corona\nteacher: Ah, I see...\nstudent: Yes we had other plans\nteacher: I like 'anti-record'! We say 'a spike in new cases' here\nteacher: Oh, have your plans been disrupted?\nstudent: What does disrupted mean?\nteacher: It means they were messed up! not completely ruined, but not going well either\nstudent: Oh ok\nstudent: So we were going to the USA\nteacher: Ooh, I see. I'm guessing that plan might have been ruined :(\nstudent: I have cousins there too\nteacher: I see, what a shame!\nteacher: I was going to go to Ukraine! I really miss it, but what can we do\nteacher: Was the end of the school year all online learning for you then?\nstudent: Yes, it was\nteacher: How did you like it?\nstudent: It was good because online school started at 9:00\nteacher: What time does it usually start? Normal school I mean\nstudent: Usualy we need to come at 8:00\nteacher: Goodness, that's early!\nteacher: And, with online school, you didn't have to ... (travel to school, what's the word from the last time?)\nstudent: Commute\nteacher: Yes, correct!\nteacher: How were online classes vs. face-to-face classes?\nstudent: Face-to-face lessons were longer\nteacher: Oh really? Interesting!\nstudent: We had pairs of face-to-face lessons\nteacher: How do you mean?\nteacher: Oh, I know\nteacher: Double Maths, double Engish and so on\nteacher: right?\nstudent: Yes you're right\nteacher: So, what do you hope will happen in September? Would you like some elements of studying from home to remain in place?\nstudent: We are going to have online school\nteacher: Oh, do you know for sure? Or is it what you think will happen?\nstudent: That's what it says on the news\nteacher: Interesting! And for how long?\nteacher: I think here in the UK the government is trying to re-open schools in September, but it might not be possible\nstudent: There are still a lot of sick people\nteacher: Yes, true :(\nstudent: I've already said about the underground\nteacher: Yes, sure, people can't commute\nteacher: My son is starting school in September. It's going to be weird!\nstudent: Do you know that now students in Ukraine learn for 12 years\nstudent: ?\nteacher: 12 years! do they start at 7?\nstudent: I'm lucky because I will only learn for 11\nstudent: And the first grade is something like a kindergarden\nteacher: Oh, that's similar to the UK. The first grade is called 'reception', and it's a bit like kindergarten\nteacher: At what age do children start school then?\nstudent: At 6\nteacher: And why are you only going to be studying for 11 years?\nstudent: It's our old programme and all children who went to school 2 years ago study for 12 years\nteacher: I see! It's a new rule then! Very interesting\nstudent: I went to school at 7\nteacher: I see, me too! I think 7 is a good age to start school.\nteacher: Because you get 7 years of freeeedom :)\nstudent: Not really\nteacher: and, of course, because children are much more mature at 7\nteacher: not really?\nteacher: kindergarten?\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: Yes :(\nteacher: But maybe you liked your kindergarten?\nteacher: I know I didn't!\nstudent: But I didn't go there\nteacher: Ah, so you did get 7 years of freedom?\nstudent: Probably only 2 weeks\nteacher: 2 weeks of freedom or 2 weeks of kindergarten? :)\nstudent: Of kindergarden\nteacher: Sounds good!\nstudent: I went to pre-school\nteacher: Oh, it's the same thing, isn't it?\nstudent: No, it isn't\nteacher: how is it different?\nstudent: A kindergarden is a place where adults leave children while they work and pre-school is a place where children learn how to write and read\nteacher: Ah, I understand, thanks for that\nstudent: You're welcome\nteacher: Here in the UK, it's a pre-school or a nursery. I think the only difference is that pre-schools are state-owned and nurseries are private.\nteacher: Quick grammar quiz, Sophia Williams\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: 1. If schools don't re-open in September, I ____ ____\nteacher: could you finish the sentence, please?\nstudent: I'll stay at home\nteacher: great!\nteacher: what about\nteacher: If I ____ in the USA now, I ____ eat cheeseburgers for breakfast!\nteacher: Silly example, I know, just for the grammar\nstudent: Have  been/ will\nteacher: How about 'If I were in the USA now, I would eat...'?\nteacher: Does it sound familiar? It's ok if it doesn't!\nstudent: I think it's similar\nteacher: It's a bit different, but we can look into this next time. It's called second conditionals, for things that are not true at the moment\nteacher: You've probably heard about it\nstudent: I thought that it's third conditional\nstudent: Oh no\nteacher: No worries, we'll play with this grammar next time!\nstudent: Can you remind please?\nteacher: We are almost out of time now, I will next time, ok?\nstudent: Oh ok\nteacher: Don't worry about it, I just needed to see what could be new and interesting for you, ok? Your English is very good!\nteacher: Shall we do next Wednesday at 9.30 am?\nstudent: Yes!\nstudent: Yes!\nteacher: Sure. It was lovely to talk to you, have a nice weekend! Until Wednesday!\nstudent: Why until Wednesday?\nteacher: Because our next class is on Wednesday!\nteacher: I didn't mean the weekend will last until Wednesday\nstudent: But I'm sure it'll be cool!\nstudent: I'm looking forward to our next lesson\nteacher: Me too :) Bye for now!\nstudent: Bye!",

Please look at the first one but don't look at the comments, ok?\nteacher: Yes!\nstudent: Okay\nteacher: Have you got it?\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: Can you see the first picture? What do you think it could be?\nstudent: hmm\nstudent: It looks like some food I think\nteacher: It does, doesn't it?\nteacher: It's magnified of course\nstudent: magnified?\nteacher: magnify = make an image bigger\nteacher: a magnifying glass is what we use to have a good look at really small objects\nstudent: oh\nstudent: okay\nteacher: What food do you think it might be?\nstudent: the thing in the middle looks like a piece of apple\nstudent: but I don't think it is\nteacher: Aha, so it could be... Could you make a sentence with one of the modals we talked about last time?\nstudent: the thing in the middle could be a piece of apple\nteacher: Good one!\nteacher: Click on the answer underneath the picture, please :)\nstudent: sushi!\nteacher: Yes!\nstudent: I love sushi\nteacher: Me too! It's much more popular in Ukraine than in the UK\nstudent: Really?Why?\nteacher: I'm not sure! But there are so many sushi restaurants in Kyiv and only a few in Cambridge, for example\nstudent: Can I ask you a question?\nteacher: It's becoming more popular now, though\nteacher: Yes sure!\nstudent: what fast food restaurants are popular in the UK?\nteacher: Good question!\nteacher: McDonalds and KFC are here of course\nteacher: But traditional English 'fast food' or takeaway food is fish and chips\nteacher: There are lots of fish-and-chips shops in every town, or 'chippies'\nstudent: I heard something about fish and chips\nteacher: Yes, it\nteacher: sorry\nteacher: It's white fish deep fried in some batter and chunky chips. Quite nice but not everyday food for me!\nstudent: why batter, but not butter?\nteacher: Then there are lots of places where you can get a coffee and a nice sandwich, such as Costa, Starbucks, Pret-a-Manger\nstudent: I know Starbucks!\nstudent: I want to have a coffee there one day\nteacher: Oh, batter is what you make out of flour, egg, maybe a bit of milk or water, or even beer. Then you put the fish in the batter and fry it\nteacher: You also make some batter to make pancakes!\nstudent: Oohh\nteacher: Is there Starbucks in Kyiv?\nstudent: No\nteacher: But I bet you've seen it in Israel?\nstudent: No, there is no Starbucks in Israel and Ukraine:(\nteacher: Ah well, I'm sure you will one day!\nteacher: What is fast food like in Israel?\nteacher: I know about Kyiv! McDonalds and Domashnya Kukhnya!\nstudent: McDonalds is the good one\nstudent: but for example\nstudent: their burger is like our double burger!\nteacher: Do you mean burgers in Israeli McDonalds are bigger than in Ukrainian ones?\nstudent: and they don't eat cheese with meat, so when I made a burger for myself with meat and cheese, they gave it to me without any cheese!\nstudent: yes, it is\nteacher: Sure, it's not kosher, right?\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: Interesting!\nteacher: Oh, something interesting I found the other day\nteacher: There is a chef from Ukraine, and she is taking Instagram by storm in this country!\nstudent: It is raining now\nteacher: She has written three (I think) amazing cookbooks about Ukrainian cooking in English\nstudent: wow\nteacher: I really recommend her Instagram account, @oliahercules\nstudent: okay, wait a minute and I will find her\nteacher: It's beautiful (and yummy!) and will be great for your English because it's all your familiar foods but in English\nstudent: I am her subscriber now\nteacher: Me too! Hope you'll enjoy it :)\nteacher: Is it raining in Kyiv then?\nstudent: I am not in Kyiv now\nteacher: It's going to rain here too later. I'm so fed up with the rain and storms!\nteacher: Oh, where are you?\nstudent: I am in Vinnytsa now\nteacher: Ah, I heard it's really nice, but I've never been\nstudent: My cousins, grandma, aunt and aunt's husband live here\nteacher: I see! Are you in the city or the country?\nstudent: what do you mean?\nteacher: Are you in Vinnytsa the city or in a village near it?\nstudent: city\nteacher: country = countryside (in this case)\nstudent: okay then\nteacher: I see! Is it very different from Kyiv?\nstudent: I think yes\nteacher: In what way?\nstudent: Kyiv is bigger\nteacher: sure)\nstudent: and in Vinnytsa there are more old people (like my grandma)\nteacher: Oh interesting! Young people probably move to Kyiv and then retire somewhere quieter, right?\nstudent: and think there is more transport in Vinnytsa\nstudent: yes, maybe\nteacher: You mean there is more public transport?\nstudent: yes\nstudent: in Vinnytsa most people don't have their own car\nteacher: And Vinnytsa's got the famous fountains\nstudent: yes\nteacher: I see! It's probably better for the environment, to use public transport\nstudent: I saw one of them\nstudent: why?\nteacher: Well, if everyone owns a car and drives around, there are more emissions per person than if everyone shares a bus\nteacher: or trolleybus! Trolleybuses are very green\nstudent: oh, I see\nteacher: are there any trolleybuses?\nstudent: of course\nstudent: course *\nteacher: Cool!\nstudent: there are a lot of them\nstudent: we also use them\nteacher: Yes, they are supposed to be more green because they use electricity, not petrol\nstudent: I like that idea\nteacher: Me too!\nteacher: I know you probably didn't have a chance to revise the new words from the last time, but I did prepare a little something to practise them for you!\nstudent: that's okay\nteacher: The words are debunk, deduce - deduction, exploration, abandon and evidence\nteacher: Could you fill in the gaps, please?\nstudent: okay\nteacher: To ____ what happened that night, the police have to look at the ____: a fresh scratch on the car, a broken lock, some footprints on the carpet.\nstudent: abandon and deduction ?\nteacher: Mmm, not quite\nstudent: both are not okay, or the one?\nteacher: first gap: understand something from looking at the facts\nteacher: none\nstudent: debunk?\nteacher: Nope!\nstudent: deduce\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: and second gap?\nstudent: evidence?\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: another one\nteacher: People used to believe the earth was flat, but that theory has been _____\nstudent: debunked\nteacher: yes, correct!\nteacher: As a baby he was ____ by his mother and left at the fire station\nstudent: abandoned\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: The 20th century was the beginning of space _____ .\nstudent: exploration?\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: another one, some words might repeat\nteacher: We were sinking fast, and the captain commanded to _____ ship.\nstudent: abandon\nteacher: yes, correct!\nteacher: Abandon ship' is also an idiom, it means to leave a failing project / bad situation before it gets worse\nteacher: Ok, another one\nteacher: Wildfires and storms could be ____ of climate change.\nstudent: evidence\nteacher: yes, well done!\nteacher: And the one from today\nteacher: The print in the old book was so small, she couldn't read without a ____ ____.\nstudent: magnifing a picture?\nteacher: good idea, but the article 'a' suggests that you need a noun, right?\nteacher: magnifying ___\nstudent: picture\nteacher: glass!\nstudent: oh\nteacher: magnifying glass\nstudent: okay\nteacher: a dictionary definition: a piece of curved glass that makes objects look bigger than they are\nteacher: Ok, Sarah Smith, a little bit of homework for you. If you have a scroll through Olia Hercules' Instagram account and find a recipe you particularly like, could you tell me about it next time? What ingredients are used and how it's made?\nstudent: okay\nteacher: Lovely!\nteacher: Thursday 10 am?\nstudent: yes\nstudent: goodbye!\nteacher: Lovely, have a good day!\nstudent: have a nice day too!\nteacher: thanks :)",

It's exactly the same here!\nteacher: Well, not very cold for England, but it's been raining since yesterday!\nstudent: But you're in your house!\nteacher: Yes, what about you?\nstudent: We don't have an internet connection in our house so we need to go to my uncle's house but he goes to work at 6:00 and I can't get in\nteacher: Oh, are you outside then? We can have a class in the afternoon instead! I don't want you to stand outside in the rain!\nstudent: I'm in something like a porch\nstudent: I\nteacher: It doesn't sound very comfortable for studying. Shall we re-schedule (find a different time for the class)?\nstudent: It's only cold\nteacher: porch' is the right word I think, yes\nstudent: I'm sure that on Friday the weather will be fine\nteacher: We can do Friday instead, no problem :)\nteacher: Friday 9.30 am then?\nstudent: I'm with my dog and cat and it's pretty warm near them:)\nteacher: Well, it's up to you! :)\nteacher: Do you know 'up to you\nteacher: ?\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: What do you say then?

Love it :) Is it from video games?\nstudent: It's probably from the army and it's always in games about the army.\nteacher: Yep, sounds right!\nteacher: Another one is 'Roger that', it's the same as 'copy that', from military and aviation\nteacher: So how do you play video games if you don't have the Internet?\nstudent: I have some offline games on my computer and I take my phone to play Fortnite with my cousin\nteacher: Makes sense! Has your new laptop arrived yet?\nstudent: To be honest I only have one video game on my computer\nteacher: GTA?\nstudent: Yes you're right\nteacher: :)\nstudent: About the laptop no, it hasn't\nteacher: it hasn't?\nstudent: Oh yes\nteacher: but not long now, right?\nstudent: I don't know\nteacher: Hope it won't be too long!\nstudent: Yes but my dad'll come to us in 2 weeks\nteacher: Oh, your Dad will join you? and bring the laptop?\nstudent: I think yes\nteacher: Fingers crossed!\nstudent: He'll bring us home and guess what!\nteacher: Ah, you're going back to Kyiv??\nteacher: There's your new laptop waiting for you there?\nstudent: It might be but my dad didn't write to me about that\nteacher: Ah I see...

To your other grandmother?\nstudent: \ud83d\ude2d\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: Oh no! It is hard though, I understand! I'd be lost without the Internet\nstudent: You see if we don't go anywhere, we will go to the vilage\nteacher: Oh I see, because of the quarantine!\nteacher: Yes, it seems everyone's plans have been ruined!\nstudent: Usualy we go to the USA or our cousins go to Lebedin with us\nteacher: You know what, let's look at some of the sentences from today. Many of them are perfectly good, but something's missing. Have a look at this one: To be honest I have only one video game on computer\nteacher: I see, no international travel this year!\nteacher: To be honest,  I have only one vide game on ___ computer. What goes in the gap?\nstudent: The\nteacher: Yes, correct! or 'my'\nteacher: I know you've heard about articles a hundred times, but for speakers of Russian / Ukrainian they are still a bit unnatural\nteacher: But they do make your sentences sound much more 'English'!\nstudent: It's one of my mistakes in essays\nteacher: Yes, I understand!\nteacher: A lot of the time, you can use my / your / his etc. instead\nteacher: like 'video games on my computer'\nstudent: Understand\nteacher: In English we say 'my' much more than in Russian / Ukrainian!\nteacher: For example, 'I put ___ hand in ___ pocket'\nteacher: What goes in the gaps?\nstudent: My hand in my pocket?\nteacher: Yes!\nteacher: We wouldn't need 'my' in Russian or Ukrainian but we do in English!\nteacher: Can you fix this one, please\nteacher: I'm with dog and cat and it's pretty warm near them\nstudent: The dog and the cat?\nteacher: Yes, possible! But also 'I'm with my dog and cat'\nteacher: Or are they your uncle's?\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: Ok, then\nteacher: I'm with ___ dog and cat'\nstudent: Uncle's dog and cat\nteacher: Nearly! 'I'm with ___ uncle's dog and cat'\nstudent: The\nteacher: we're not sure whose uncle he is! :)\nstudent: It's strange\nteacher: I know :) but still!\nteacher: I'm with...\nstudent: My uncle's dog and cat\nteacher: yes!!\nteacher: well done!\nteacher: Ok, now this one, easy 'mum must be angry if we don't have lesson'\nstudent: My mum\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: Family members (my Mum, my uncle), pets (my cat), belongings (my computer), body parts ('my head hurts') - we always need to say whose they are\nteacher: Which is easy, because you can use my / his / your etc. and not think about articles!\nstudent: Only 10 minutes left!\nteacher: I know, we can finish early if you are getting cold?\nstudent: I'm really cold\nteacher: Oh, poor Alexandra! Go get somewhere warm! I'll see you on Friday 9.30 am. Well done today, you've been very brave!\nstudent: Bye! See you on Friday\nteacher: Bye! Take care",

Sounds so nice!\nteacher: Olia definitely inspired me to cook more Ukrainian food! My husband and my English friends didn't experience the best of Ukrainian food when they lived in Kyiv I'm afraid\nteacher: Nice use of 'batter', well done :)\nstudent: thanks\nteacher: What does your username mean today? :)\nstudent: there is one song in my head today\nstudent: so that's a part of the text from the song\nteacher: Ok!\nteacher: cool\nstudent: The Name Game\nteacher: Lovely\nteacher: Oh, before we go on, I've got to say that I'll be on holiday next week, so our next class will be the week after, ok?\nstudent: ok!\nteacher: Tuesday 21 July 10 am?\nstudent: okay\nteacher: Lovely, I'll mark it in my diary\nteacher: Internet connection troubles?\nstudent: nope\nstudent: I also marked that:)\nteacher: ah, I see :)\nteacher: Ok Anna, I thought we could talk about adjectives and how prefixes can give them the opposite meaning\nteacher: For example, happy - unhappy\nteacher: Do you know what I mean?\nstudent: comfortable\nstudent: uncomfortable\nteacher: yes, correct!\nteacher: friendly - ?\nstudent: unfriendly\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: healthy - ?\nstudent: fortunately-unfortunately\nteacher: yes!\nstudent: unhealthy\nteacher: correct!\nteacher: satisfied - ?\nstudent: unsatisfied\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: possible - ?\nstudent: impossible\nteacher: Ooops!\nteacher: You know it, possible - ...?\nstudent: impossible\nteacher: yes! :)\nteacher: un' is a very popular prefix, but not all adjectives work with it\nteacher: logical - ...?\nstudent: illogical\nteacher: nope, illogical\nstudent: locked-unlocked\nteacher: yes, correct\nteacher: polite - ?\nstudent: impolite\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: legal - ?\nstudent: illegal\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: regular - ?\nteacher: Verbs can be regular and ___\nstudent: irregular\nteacher: yes, well done!\nteacher: rational - ...?\nstudent: irrational\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: So, if we look at them: logical - illogical, possible - impossible, legal - illegal, polite - impolite, regular - irregular, rational - irrational\nteacher: Can you see what the rule is? When do we use il- / ir- / im-?\nstudent: im with p\nstudent: ir with r\nteacher: yes!\nstudent: il with l\nteacher: yes, correct! because it's easier to pronounce them like this\nteacher: We also use 'im' with m\nteacher: for example, mature - ?\nstudent: immature\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: What about correct - ...?\nstudent: incorrect\nteacher: Yes, 'in' is another prefix with the opposite meaning, but it's use is a bit more irregular\nteacher: expensive - ...?\nstudent: no idea\nteacher: inexpensive\nteacher: sane - ? (do you know 'sane'?)\nstudent: insane\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: and finally, convenient - ?\nstudent: inconvenient\nteacher: yes, correct!\nstudent: I don't know this word\nteacher: Oh, if something is convenient, it's easy to use. For example, public transport in Vinnytsa is very convenient. There are lots of buses and trolleybuses and you can travel anywhere\nstudent: okay\nteacher: Or 'Is a lesson on Tuesday 21 10 am convenient for you?'\nteacher: as in 'does it fit in with your plans?'\nstudent: I see what you mean\nteacher: Sometimes when there are road works and people have to drive around, the notice says 'We apologize for any inconvenience'\nteacher: Ok, I'll give you some quick definitions, and you give me adjectives with prefixes, ok?\nstudent: ok\nteacher: If something is wrong, it's _____\nstudent: incorrect?\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: cheap = ?\nstudent: inexpensive\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: If something doesn't make sense, it's ___\nstudent: insane?\nteacher: possible, yes, but insane is more like 'crazy'\nstudent: irrational\nteacher: it doesn't make logical sense, it's\nteacher: irrational - also good\nteacher: but I was thinking about 'illogical'\nteacher: We often use 'irrational' with 'irrational decision' or 'irrational feelings'\nteacher: okl?\nstudent: ok\nteacher: Ok, next one: rude = ?\nstudent: impolite\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: We used to have Maths on Mondays and Wednesdays, but now it's all over the place, sometimes every day, sometimes only on Mondays. It's really _____\nstudent: inconvenient\nteacher: ha, possible, but I was thinking about ____ the opposite of regular!\nstudent: irregular\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: Now let's swap. You give me examples and I'll try to guess the words, ok?\nstudent: okay\nstudent: You can't buy alcohol! You are not 18 yet. It is ______!\nteacher: illegal\nstudent: yes\nteacher: good example!\nstudent: you are ___ if you think you can do this!\nteacher: insane?\nstudent: yeah\nteacher: great!\nstudent: you are absolutely ___ because you are too little to do this\nteacher: irrational?\nstudent: no\nteacher: hmm\nteacher: impossible?\nstudent: no\nstudent: immmmmm...\nteacher: I give up\nstudent: immature\nteacher: Ah, of course!!\nstudent: ____, we didn't win:(\nteacher: unfortunately\nstudent: yes\nteacher: good one\nstudent: this door is ____\nteacher: unlocked!\nstudent: yep\nteacher: Lovely, thank you, well done today!\nstudent: thanks\nteacher: If you want, you can stay in the chatroom a bit longer and copy the new words into a notebook or something. Or just do so from memory!\nstudent: memory\nteacher: Enjoy your week off and I'll talk to you on Tuesday 21 July!\nstudent: thank you!\nstudent: have a nice holiday!\nteacher: Thank you! Take care :)\nstudent: bye!",
    "teacher: Hi Emma Smith!\nstudent: Hello!\nteacher: How are you this morning? Out of the cold and rain?\nstudent: Today the weather is good:)\nteacher: Are you still in the porch though?\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: Ok! Well, hope you are comfortable\nteacher: Have you got any plans for the weekend?\nstudent: No, I don't have any plans\nteacher: And you are on holiday anyway, right? :)\nteacher: Before we start, I've got to say that I'll be on holiday next week, so we won't have any classes until the week after. Would 9.30 on Wednesday July 22 suit you?\nstudent: I think yes\nteacher: Cool, I'll make a note in my diary. I'll send you an email to remind you, too!\nteacher: You might be in Kyiv then, right?\nstudent: Ok thank you!\nstudent: I'm not sure, we might go to another vilage\nteacher: We're going to do the whole 'staycation' thing. Remember we talked about 'staycation'?\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: Yes, probably going to the seaside, some gardens and a dinosaur adventure park...\nteacher: Oh yes, I remember, you did mention you might go to another village\nteacher: We were talking about articles last time, right? And we said an easy way to get out of using articles is to use my/ your / his / her / their / our\nteacher: possessive pronouns'\nteacher: are you there, Emma Smith?\nstudent: Yes the cat tried to fight with my phone:)\nteacher: haha :))\nteacher: Does the cat want to sit in your lap instead?\nstudent: Do you want a story about my cat in Kyiv?\nteacher: Yes please!\nstudent: My cat is called Luna\nteacher: nice name :)\nstudent: Once my dad left his laptop on his bed. My family were in the kitchen. We were talking and then we heard loud music. When we came to my mum and dad's room, we saw our cat on my dad's laptop. Her eyes were very big. I'm sure that she didn't understand what happened! It was pretty fun\nteacher: Haha, she played the music? Poor cat, she must have been shocked :))\nstudent: She just turned the player on the laptop on\nteacher: Haha, well done Luna!\nteacher: Are the cats in your village outdoors cats?\nstudent: Yes\nstudent: About Luna\nteacher: I live in a very small town, it's very rural, and cats around here are just wild predators!\nteacher: Yes, go on!\nstudent: You're the first who didn't ask why my cat is a girl and she is called Luna\nteacher: Do you mean Luna like a type of food?\nstudent: Anyway all people think that Luna  is a he\nteacher: So what's the story behind the name?\nstudent: She has 3 names: the first is Milo, the second is Luna and the third is Luna\nstudent: Now the reasons\nteacher: Ok!\nteacher: Is Milo because she sleeps a lot?\nstudent: 1: she loves sleeping 2: my mum said that it's a cool name 3: because she's a three-coloured cat and I called her Luna\nstudent: You're right about Milo\nteacher: haha, I guessed the first one!\nstudent: The first one was easy\nteacher: I love three-coloured cats. I think they are called 'calico' cats\nstudent: Did you know that male 'calico' cats are very rare\nstudent: ?\nteacher: No! Is that so?\nstudent: Yes I have 3 'calico' cats in this vilage they're girls and Luna in Kyiv\nteacher: Oh wow! Are they sisters / mothers and daughters?\nstudent: No\nteacher: Nice! A gang of calico cats!\nstudent: My family loves 'calico' cats\nteacher: I can see why! They are beautiful!\nteacher: Emma Smith, is it you?\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: Ok :)\nteacher: Just checking\nteacher: Ok, quick look at the articles!\nstudent: It's the kitty, it's very playful\nteacher: Haha, she wants to participate!\nstudent: She closed the programme\nteacher: I was thinking how to help you with the articles without learning dozens of rules\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: And I think the best thing we can do to understand them is to think about 'a/an' as 'any'.\nteacher: For example, there is A tree in front of my house. Any tree, one of many trees!\nteacher: But if we use 'the', we both know what we are talking about. In a way, we can often use 'this / that / these /those' instead of 'the'\nteacher: And that's the main difference\nstudent: Can I ask a question?\nteacher: Yes, sure!\nstudent: About your son\nteacher: Go on\nstudent: Does he have something like 2 names?\nteacher: Oh, do you mean forename and middle name?\nteacher: He does, actually. He is called Ethan Matthews Jones., but we call him Ethan\nstudent: Oh ok\nstudent: Because I have cousins in the USA\nteacher: His Dad's name is Michael, so his middle name is a bit like a patronymic in Ukrainian\nteacher: But it doesn't have to be, a middle name can be anything!\nstudent: Yes because my oldest cousin is called Amelia Rodriguez\nstudent: His friends call him Mia or Ella\nteacher: Ah yes, Ella sounds very American\nstudent: I call him Liam\nteacher: Middle names are hardly ever used in the UK. They are mostly for documents, of if people don't like their first names\nteacher: Emma Smith, does what I said about articles make sense to you?\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: a = any, the = this / that / these /those\nteacher: not quite, but just something to keep in mind\nteacher: For example, you said earlier 'the cat is fighting with my phone'\nteacher: The cat - absolutely correct, because we both know which cat you mean! Your uncle's cat who in the porch with you, right?\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: And when you asked, 'Do you want A story about her name?' - also correct, because you know that there is a story and I don't\nteacher: In some cases, we just have to remember it. Like 'the weather' is always 'the weather'\nteacher: How would you ask me about the weather where I am?\nstudent: What is the weather like in your country?\nteacher: What's the weather ___ in your country?\nteacher: a short word is missing!\nstudent: Is in\nteacher: nope, you have 'is' already\nstudent: Now?\nteacher: like!\nteacher: What's the weather like?\nstudent: Oh ok\nteacher: It's been raining since Tuesday!\nteacher: What's life like in your village?\nstudent: It's hard and interesting\nteacher: Good answer! I kind of want to know more, but it's time to let you go!\nteacher: Enjoy a break, and I'll talk to you again on Wednesday 22 July, and I'll email you to remind :)\nstudent: Bye\nteacher: Take care",
    "teacher: Hi Emily Johnson!\nstudent: hello\nteacher: Sorry to hear you want to sleep!\nstudent: :)\nteacher: How's life? Are you still in Vinnytsa?\nstudent: everything is okay\nstudent: I am in Kovel now\nteacher: Nice! Visiting family again?\nstudent: no, just visiting friends\nteacher: Sounds good. I've never been to Kovel - is it nice?\nstudent: Yes, but it's little\nteacher: Ok\nstudent: the tallest building here is 9 floors\nteacher: ah, the tallest building\nstudent: and there aren't many good shops to buy clothes\nteacher: There are no tall buildings in my town at all! Maybe three floors maximum\nstudent: wow\nstudent: I am living on the 20th floor (in Kyiv)\nteacher: Oh wow!\nteacher: But most of England is very low rise, and most houses are two floors, including ours.\nteacher: In a house, both floors belong to the same owner, so you have a downstairs (usually living room, dining room and kitchen) and an upstairs area (usually bedrooms)\nstudent: Yeah, I understand\nteacher: Some people live in flats, especially in big cities, and flats are usually on one level. Which is probably why they are called 'flats', now that I'm thinking about it\nstudent: I think it is better to live in a house\nteacher: And what do you call a house that has only got the ground floor?\nstudent: what do you mean?\nteacher: Do you know the word for a house that hasn't got an upstairs?\nstudent: no\nteacher: a bungalow\nstudent: oh\nteacher: the stress is on the first syllable\nstudent: I didn't know it, but I know it is the same in Russian\nteacher: Old people sometimes move to bungalows because of mobility problems. But it's not just for older people, obviously\nteacher: it's the same ___ Russian\nstudent: in\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: I've got a nice mystery picture for you today, I couldn't guess what it was! I'll send you the link on Skype\nteacher: What do you think it could be?\nstudent: it might be a tree?\nteacher: Good idea, but no!\nteacher: and a good modal verb :)\nstudent: it might be an animal?\nteacher: yes, closer!\nteacher: What kind of animal?\nstudent: a fish?\nteacher: nope!\nstudent: a bug?\nteacher: warmer, warmer\nstudent: a butterfly?\nteacher: yes, you got it!! well done!\nstudent: yay\nteacher: the image is ____ (made much to look much bigger, so that you can see it in detail)\nteacher: sorry, 'made to look much bigger'\nteacher: do you remember the word? m------ed\nstudent: mo------ed\nteacher: no! magni----\nstudent: magnified!\nteacher: yes! and what do we call a device that allows us to see objects as if they were bigger?\nstudent: magnifier\nteacher: yes, or magnifying glass\nteacher: Ok, let's quickly go through our modals of deduction. If you think it's possible that something happened, you can say 'It ___ ____ happened'\nstudent: might have\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: If you are sure that this is what happened?\nstudent: must have\nteacher: yes, and if you are sure it didn't happen?\nstudent: can't have\nteacher: yes, correct!\nteacher: Ok, I just got back from a week of holiday, could you use modals of deduction to make sentences about what I did / where I went etc.? Just to practise those\nstudent: what do you mean?\nteacher: for example, you could say, Ms. Hernandez, you can't have been abroad because of the quarantine.\nteacher: You could have gone to the countryside, or something like that\nteacher: Are you still feeling confused?\nstudent: yes\nstudent: what did you mean by what you did/where you went?\nteacher: Well, you don't know what I did and where I went on holiday, right? But you might have some ideas, and that's where the modals of deduction come in.\nstudent: like You must have been at home or You can't have been to Italy\nteacher: For example, I'll try to make sentences about your trip to Vinnytsa\nteacher: Yes, all good\nteacher: You must have enjoyed Vinnytsa because it's quieter than Kyiv\nteacher: You might have been a bit bored because there might have been fewer things to do than at home\nteacher: You can't have missed the famous Vinnytsa fountains\nteacher: Things like this\nstudent: okay\nstudent: do you want me to tell you a funny story?\nteacher: Please!\nstudent: do you know Smeshariki?\nteacher: The cartoon?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: I do\nstudent: so yesterday I was on a beach\nteacher: Ok\nstudent: and my face was very red yesterday\nteacher: Did you catch the sun?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Oh no!\nstudent: and my friend made funny 'things' on my head\nstudent: so it looked like needles, so I thought I looked like Yozhik from Smeshariki!\nstudent: (I will have curly hair after it)\nteacher: Haha, oh no!\nteacher: Oh I see, did your friend curl your hair?\nstudent: If you want to, I can send you a picture of what I look like now\nteacher: Ok, on Skype, right\nstudent: it is not easy to explain\nteacher: Oh, they are almost like dreadlocks, very cool!\nstudent: after that it must be very curly\nteacher: after that ___ must be very curly\nteacher: (hair)\nstudent: it?\nteacher: Yes! Like in Ukrainian, right?\nteacher: but not like in Russian\nstudent: yeah\nteacher: Ok, Emily Johnson, something I wanted to ask you. What would you like to learn about in the rest of our classes? Some topics that you find interesting or anything? Because, unlike at school, we don't have to follow the book\nstudent: some topics I find interesting\nstudent: everything I wrote in the form\nteacher: What topics for example? I remember you are into chess and coding, is that right?\nstudent: yes\nstudent: and math\nteacher: Are you a competitive chess player or do you play for fun?\nteacher: And math, yes!\nstudent: for fun\nteacher: cool! do you enjoy any other board games?\nstudent: Monopoly\nteacher: Ok, and can you tell me a bit about your coding hobby?\nstudent: I don't really know what to say\nstudent: like when is it or where?\nteacher: Well, what language you use, what programmes you write\nstudent: we use C++\nstudent: in usual lessons we used Unity\nteacher: Did you learn any of these at school?\nstudent: but during the quarantine we just used a website to train, because not all the computers can have Unity\nstudent: at school I learn Python\nstudent: it is absolutely different\nteacher: Oh wow, I'm impressed that Python is now taught at schools!\nstudent: it is only in our school I think:(\nteacher: Ah, I see! Makes sense\nstudent: and you must be in a C class\nteacher: What's a C class?\nstudent: and special ITC group\nstudent: ABCD classes\nstudent: like 6-B\nteacher: Ah, got you\nstudent: you see\nteacher: Ok, Emily Johnson, I'll let you go enjoy your day, thank you, and see on Thursday same time?\nstudent: okay\nstudent: goodbye\nstudent: have a nice day!\nteacher: Thanks, you too!",
    "teacher: Hi Sarah\nstudent: Hi Mr. Patel\nteacher: How are you today?\nstudent: I'm fine\nteacher: Good to hear. Have you returned to Kyiv?\nstudent: No, I haven't\nteacher: No, I __m\nteacher: sorry\nteacher: No, I __n't.\nteacher: What goes in the gap?\nstudent: Oh haven't\nteacher: Sure!\nteacher: Are you still in the same village at your grandmother's or the other one?\nstudent: We are still in the first village\nteacher: I see. Are you friends the cat and the dog still there in the porch with you?\nstudent: Yes the cat is in my hoody\nteacher: Oh that's cute :)\nstudent: It's windy today\nteacher: Ah, I don't like windy weather! We get a lot of winds, I think because of the Atlantic\nstudent: It's fine when you're in the house\nteacher: Are you too cold again?\nstudent: No, I have the cat with me\nstudent: :)\nteacher: as a personal radiator :) well, let me know if you are too uncomfortable!\nstudent: Ok I'll ask the cat:)\nteacher: Sarah, I wanted your opinion on something\nstudent: It's pretty warm with the cat\nteacher: My son is nearly 5, and his best friend, who is 6, loves playing Fortnite with his school friends. Of course, now my son wants to play it, too! What do you think - is he too young?\nstudent: There is no blood\nteacher: Ok, that's good, but could you tell me a bit more about it?\nstudent: Ok and after that a funny fact about me\nteacher: Ok!\nteacher: Are you there? typing?\nstudent: It's a shooter. There is no blood and the monsters aren't scary but they were only for special event. You can find a Fortnite trailer and gameplay videos and you can download it on your phone, pc, xbox, ps4 and nintendo swich. (About xbox and ps4. You'll need xbox live for xbox and ps subscribe to play online) It's teen and looks like a movie.\nteacher: Sounds cool, thanks for that! It's probably aimed at teenagers though, not young kids, right?\nstudent: It's teen but you need to see the gameplay\nstudent: If you want, I can send you one\nteacher: I'm sure I can find it, thank you! It's reassuring that there is no blood\nteacher: So what's the fun fact about you? :)\nstudent: Have you ever played Lego Star Wars?\nteacher: Yes! We like it a lot\nstudent: Fortnite is very similar to it\nteacher: Oh is it?\nstudent: But the characters aren't Lego:)\nteacher: Aha, you mean 'characters'?\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: Yes, makes sense\nstudent: Now the fact\nteacher: Go on!\nstudent: Now I'm 13 and my mum checks all video games that I want to buy. The first time I played Fortnite I was about 11 and my mum said that it was a shooter. Then me and my cousin tried to show her that it wasn't a usual shooter and she said that I could play it\nstudent: So fortnite was checked by my mum\nstudent: My brother started to play Fortnite at 7\nteacher: Aha, approved by your mum, I see! You were 11 though, not 5... I have to think about this one, I think I'll take your advice and watch the trailer and the gameplay\nteacher: Why is it not a usual shooter then?\nstudent: Because there is no blood and it's different from others and all shooters are always 18+\nteacher: I see! It all makes sense, thank you very much!\nteacher: Also, really well done with all the writing today!\nstudent: But you still need to see the gameplay\nteacher: Oh I will now, thank you. It'll be my homework :)\nteacher: Now, let's have a go at some sentences I copied from the chat. Could you insert the missing word?\nteacher: It's pretty warm with cat\nstudent: The cat?\nteacher: Yes, correct!\nteacher: Ok and after that some funny fact about me\nteacher: In this one, can you change one word?\nstudent: Facts\nteacher: Ha, ok, that could work\nteacher: or 'after that ___ fun fact about me'\nstudent: One fact\nteacher: Ok, and if you use an article?\nstudent: The\nteacher: Hmm, the thing is, if you say 'the fun fact about me', it means there's only one fun fact about you. I'm sure that's not true! We are talking one of many fun facts, and the article is ???\nstudent: A\nteacher: Yes!\nteacher: Does it make sense? 'The fun fact about me' means there is only one!\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: If I say 'The apple tree in my garden hasn't got any apples on it this year'\nteacher: How many apple trees have I got?\nstudent: One tree\nteacher: Yes, that's right! But\nteacher: an apple tree' means I probably have more than one, and I'm talking about one of them\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: All right, the next one\nteacher: It's fine when you in house\nteacher: What would you change? Also article-related\nstudent: Your\nteacher: Yes, well done!\nteacher: Ok, next one.\nteacher: It's shooter.\nstudent: A\nteacher: Yes!\nteacher: Next one\nteacher: you can download it on phone\nstudent: Your\nteacher: Correct!\nteacher: and looks like movie\nstudent: A\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: me and cousin tried to show her\nstudent: My\nteacher: yes, easy, isn't it?\nteacher: you still need to see gameplay\nstudent: Aha\nstudent: A\nteacher: Mmm, it's the gameplay we talked about before, so I would go for 'the gameplay'\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: Ok, well done with the articles!\nteacher: Have you got any questions about them?\nstudent: No\nteacher: Ok :)\nteacher: A couple of spelling things that I noticed.\nteacher: Village' has double ll, like 'villa'\nteacher: But 'usual' has only one 's'\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: Usually' - one s and double ll\nteacher: Ok Sarah, thank you for today, very well done!

Is it still sunny and summery?\nstudent: it is sunny, but a bit cold\nteacher: Oh that's a shame\nteacher: Ok Emily, quick memory test. Could you give me an adjective with the opposite meaning?\nteacher: possible - ?\nstudent: impossible\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: logical\nstudent: illogical\nteacher: legal\nstudent: illegal\nteacher: polite\nstudent: impolite\nteacher: expensive\nstudent: inexpensive\nteacher: yes, correct!\nteacher: regular\nstudent: irregular\nteacher: mature\nstudent: immature\nteacher: correct - ?\nstudent: incorrect\nteacher: rational\nstudent: irrational\nteacher: sane\nstudent: insane\nteacher: convenient\nstudent: inconvenient\nteacher: comfortable\nstudent: uncomfortable\nteacher: yes, very well done! :)\nteacher: What does 'convenient' mean?\nstudent: like comfortable\nteacher: Mmm, it is the same word in Russian, yes. But in English, a sofa is comfortable but a bus that takes you where you want to go fast is convenient\nteacher: Convenient is about saving you time and effort\nstudent: oops\nteacher: And comfortable is about making your body feel relaxed, like comfortable jeans\nteacher: No worries, this is a very common mistake\nteacher: For example, my house is very close to the railway station, which makes it convenient for commuting\nstudent: okay\nteacher: And if I say, Emily, can you go to Obolon to pick up a book, then to Darnitsa, then to Holosievka, you'll be like, sorry Ms. Anderson, this is a bit _convenient for me as they are so far away from each other\nstudent: in\nteacher: Yes, that's right :)\nteacher: Ok, Emily, how do you feel about phrasal verbs in English?\nstudent: like\nteacher: Oh good! They do make English sound very natural when we use them. I prepared some for today, all to do with one of the most important thing in our lives that we spend hours every day on\nteacher: Can you guess what it is?\nteacher: *one of the most important thingS\nstudent: like dress up?\nteacher: Yes, that's right, a verb + preposition that work together and mean something different from just the verb\nstudent: okay\nteacher: Ok, all today's phrasal verbs have something to do with mobile phones! I bet you know a lot of them, let's see\nteacher: We press the power button, to ___ the phone on / off\nstudent: put\nteacher: no, we switch the phone on / off\nteacher: For example, when we get on a plane, we have to ___ ___ our phones\nstudent: switch off\nteacher: Yes, that's right!\nteacher: Are you allowed to use your phone at school or do you have to switch it off?\nstudent: we are allowed to use them, but our teacher and most parents don't allow our class to use them\nteacher: Oh I see, so do you have it on you, but switched off?\nstudent: but does it disturb anybody?:)\nstudent: we can only call somebody if we need to\nteacher: I see, if you are unwell and want your parents to pick you up for example?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: sure, that makes sense\nstudent: or just to tell your parents something\nteacher: Right, I see\nteacher: Ok, if I call you and want to talk, but it's a bad time for you, for example you are having dinner, you can tell me, sorry Ms. Anderson, can I ___ you back in 10 minutes?\nstudent: call\nteacher: Yes, well done! Call someone back = return a call at a later time\nteacher: Ok, if your phone battery is low, you need to ___ it up\nstudent: charge\nteacher: Yes, good!\nteacher: And to charge it up, we need to use a cable to ___ it in\nstudent: no idea\nteacher: plug it in\nteacher: #ERROR!\nteacher: When it's all charged up, we unplug it again\nteacher: plug something in' is the opposite of 'unplug something'\nstudent: ok\nteacher: Ok, two more\nteacher: When we are talking to someone, and suddenly there is no signal, we are ___ off\nstudent: :(\nteacher: cut off\nteacher: Same on Zoom or Skype, if suddenly there is no Internet, we get cut off\nteacher: And one last!

But he enjoys his Lego games, and also the actual Lego\nteacher: Do you like Lego?\nstudent: Yes I like Lego and my cousin is 15 and I'm 13 and we still play Lego games and Lego:)\nteacher: Ah, they are so good!

I've never taken care of a reptile\nstudent: So I have cat Luna, dog Buddy and lizard Spike\nteacher: Lucky you! Is it male or female?\nstudent: It's similar to looking after a cat\nteacher: Oh really?\nstudent: If you want to know whether it is male or female, you need to do a DNA test\nstudent: It's very expensive\nteacher: Oh wow! Is that why it's called Spike, because it could be both a boy's and a girl's name?\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: Makes sense\nteacher: So you'll just have to give it some food?\nstudent: Some bugs\nteacher: Yuck!\nstudent: Give it some water\nteacher: I'm not really disgusted by bugs, I live in the country and garden a lot :)\nteacher: And probably keep it warm?\nstudent: Yes\nstudent: I don't like snails you must know why\nteacher: Why?\nstudent: Oh you don't know?\nstudent: Because they have slime\nstudent: And bugs are dry\nteacher: Slugs and snails are my chief enemies because they eat my plants!\nteacher: And yes, they are yucky and slimey, that's because they are mollusks, not insects!\nteacher: But snails can be quite cute I think\nstudent: I agree\nteacher: Is your lizard cuddly?\nstudent: What does it mean?\nteacher: To cuddle someone means to hug them and keep them close. If a pet or child or even grown-up is cuddly, it means they like to cuddle\nteacher: Dogs are usually super cuddly\nstudent: Yes Spike is fine when someone takes her\nteacher: Cool!

Questions that start with a verb (do, does, is, am, are, have, has, had) are yes / no questions (or general questions)\nteacher: Because we can answer them with a yes or no!\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: Not so much in case of 'plants or bugs' because there is an 'or'\nteacher: But generally. Do you go to school? yes. Are you a student? Yes\nteacher: You get the idea\nteacher: When we change these questions into reported speech, we need to use 'if' or 'whether'\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: Because we don't have a question word, like 'how old' or 'where' or 'when'\nteacher: Makes sense?\nstudent: Aha\nteacher: Do you go to school? --- I don't know if you go to school. / I don't know whether you go to school.\nteacher: Let's try again, you reconstruct the question\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: I don't know whether you have ever watched Star Wars.\nstudent: Have you ever watched Star Wars?\nteacher: Yes, well done!\nteacher: I wonder if your lizard sleeps a lot.\nstudent: Does your lizard sleep a lot\nteacher: Almost!

'Somebody left ___ coat here.' Could you insert a his / her / their, please?\nstudent: His\nteacher: What if it's 'her'?\nteacher: We don't know whether it's a he or a she, so we often use 'their'\nstudent: Oh ok\nteacher: Somebody can be replaced with they\nteacher: and other words like this\nteacher: So you need to ask a person to post a photo with ___?'\nstudent: Them?\nteacher: Yes! Does it sound crazy?\nstudent: Yes!\nteacher: I think everybody posts ___ only for friends'\nteacher: I know!

Both of them waited but at the and one of them ate the marshmallow\nstudent: But I didn't really understand what the test was about\nteacher: Aha, yes. The test is supposed to test self-control in children. The first marshmallow test was done in the 1960s, and the researchers followed the lives of the children. They found that the children that didn't eat the marshmallows went on to do better at school, go to good univerisities and generally were more successful in life\nteacher: But it wasn't all that simple - we'll talk about it next time. Are we ok for Friday 9.30 am?\nstudent: Yes bye!\nteacher: Yes, talk to you on Friday!",

Have you got more pets there?\nstudent: 3 kitties and 2 cats\nteacher: Oh wow! You mean three little kittens?\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: Aw, that's lovely\nstudent: They're 3 months old\nteacher: That's a very playful age :)\nstudent: Yes I have one story\nteacher: Fire away :)\nstudent: So the kittens are 1. grey, 2. black and white and 3. white and black\nteacher: ok\nteacher: are you still there?\nteacher: ignore me if you are typing\nstudent: The grey one found a frog and started to play. She played for about 20 minutes then the white and black came and she played for about 20 minutes and when she left the frog started to jump and run away, then the black one started to play with it\nteacher: Haha, oh my word, poor frog!\nteacher: Did the frog survive?\nstudent: Somehow, yes!\nstudent: They probably played with their paws\nteacher: Haha, that's a good story!\nteacher: I've had a stressful week because we had to take one of our guinea pigs to the vet's and it had a surgery!\nstudent: What does surgery mean?\nteacher: a surgery = an operation\nteacher: a doctor that does performs operations is called 'a surgeon'\nteacher: sorry,\nteacher: a doctor that performs operations', without 'does'\nstudent: Ok\nstudent: But why did it have an operation?\nteacher: It had a really bad infection on its eye, or possibly even cancer\nteacher: So now it's only got one eye\nteacher: left\nstudent: Oh poor pig\nteacher: I know, poor little thing!\nstudent: :(\nteacher: But we really hope he'll recover nicely, he started to eating yesterday and we're giving him lots of carrot, his favourite\nteacher: *'started to eat', sorry!\nteacher: Quick question, Sophia Wang. Do you like Harry Potter books?\nstudent: Yes!\nteacher: Have you read them all?\nstudent: Yes, but I read them 2 years ago\nteacher: Fair enough - all 7 of them?\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: Cool! I love them too! I'm having an HP-themed class with Chris Saunders today, but we can have one next week if you want. Chris Saunders is a huge HP fan!\nstudent: I know\nteacher: Do you? ok.  So would you like an HP class next time?\nstudent: I don't know I don't remember much\nteacher: Don't worry, ok :)\nteacher: Ok, quick grammar practice for our modals!\nstudent: We can try\nteacher: Ok!\nteacher: The car is all wet. It __ ___ rained at night.\nstudent: Must have\nteacher: Yes, good!\nteacher: A boy came home really upset. What do you think could have happened?\nteacher: I think he can't have had a good day!\nteacher: What do you think? Imaginary situation\nstudent: His dog might have run away\nteacher: Yes, sure. His dog might have run away\nteacher: What else?'\nstudent: His parents might have said that he couldn't use his laptop\nteacher: Yes, good one!\nteacher: Anything else?\nstudent: No\nteacher: Ok!\nteacher: So, the marshmallow test. Like I said last time, in the original test back in the 1960s, the researchers followed the lives of the children who ate the marshmallow and those who waited and got another one\nteacher: And what do you think they discovered?\nstudent: You said that those who didn't eat the marshmallow had better marks at school and they were more successful in life\nteacher: Yes, that's right!\nteacher: So the researchers were really excited and though, ha, all we need to do to make children successful is to teach them some self-control!\nteacher: Do you think it worked?\nstudent: I think no\nteacher: And you are right! Why not?\nstudent: Because self-control isn't the only thing that children need to be sucsessful?\nteacher: Yes, sure. It's not the only thing they need! What else would you say they need?\nstudent: I don't know\nteacher: Ok, no problem\nteacher: After the first marshmallow test, researchers were doing it again and again with different children and then following their lives, and the results were not the same!\nteacher: But most importantly, there could have been other reasons behind children not eating / eating the marshmallow\nteacher: For example, they might not have liked marshmallows!\nteacher: Or they could have wanted to please the researchers\nstudent: Yes, that's true\nteacher: What do you think could have been the reasons?\nstudent: Maybe some of them were too young?\nteacher: Yes, exactly!\nteacher: Could you make a sentence with a modal? Some of them ___ ___ ___ too young\nstudent: Might have been\nteacher: yes, excellent!\nteacher: You're absolutely right, things like 'self-control' and complex motivations come to us when we get older\nteacher: Also, some of them were kids from rich families and some from poor\nteacher: How do you think kids from rich families reacted?\nstudent: They might have eaten it\nteacher: They might! But also, rich kids had the money to buy lots of toys and sweets, and one marshmallow wasn't as important to them. So it might have been easier for them not to eat it\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: But poor kids didn't get much stuff, and when they saw the marshmallow, they just ate it\nteacher: And then rich kids went to better schools and universitities / colleges and got into better jobs!\nteacher: Not because they had better self-control, but because they could afford them\nteacher: And this is how the marshmallow test was debunked. Debunk = prove a theory wrong\nstudent: I think it can be any food\nteacher: yes, of course!\nteacher: Ok, Sophia Wang. Another question. Would you like our classes to continue in September or stop? Either answer is fine, and you don't have to answer now, just something to think about. I know you'll have school and then your Global Language Academy English and probably other things, so I don't want you to take on more than you'll have time for. Also, I will only be able to work between 11 am and 4.30 pm\nstudent: No, my school finishes at 4:35 PM\nstudent: Did Chris Saunders answer?\nteacher: I said she should have a think too\nstudent: I think she will answer the same\nteacher: We can only have one class a week or stop entirely - it's up to you!\nteacher: Are you and Chris Saunders at school together? Or just Global Language Academy?\nstudent: Yes, at school we are in the same class\nteacher: What do you mean, by the way, your school will at 4:35 PM? Do you mean classes finish at 4:35 PM?\nstudent: Aha\nteacher: Ah, I didn't know that! I thought you were just at Global Language Academy\nstudent: Wait a minute! What do you mean?\nteacher: I mean I thought you and Chris Saunders were in the same English class at Global Language Academy, I didn't know you were at school together\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: Anyway, you have a good think about it, ok? Because you'll also have homework etc. and it's also important to have some free time. Obviously, I'd be happy to continue, but it's up to you!\nteacher: Hi Chris Saunders!\nstudent: Hello\nstudent: Maybe if you have time on weekends\nteacher: Sophia Wang and I are just discussing September, sorry, we ran a bit late\nteacher: I don't think I'll have the time at the weekend, sorry\nstudent: no problem\nstudent: Ok I'll think bye!\nteacher: Anyway, you have a think, and I'll speak to you Wednesday 9.30, Sophia Wang, ok?\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: Cool, have a nice weekend, bye!\nteacher: Chris Saunders, could we please leave the chatroom and enter again?\nstudent: okay",

Well, you do know your Harry Potter books!\nstudent: yes)\nteacher: Was it nice to read bits in English?\nstudent: yeah\nstudent: interesting\nteacher: Would you like to look at the photos again and see if there are any bits that are hard to understand? I'll give you 5 min\nstudent: snarled\nstudent: feeble\nstudent: grunted\nstudent: lawn\nstudent: idle\nteacher: Got it, anything else?\nstudent: shrivelled bean\nstudent: hastily\nstudent: lilac\nstudent: stirred\nstudent: palest pink\nstudent: demanded\nstudent: fumes\nstudent: cauldron\nstudent: slab\nstudent: crumpled\nstudent: piped up\nstudent: cellar\nstudent: throat\nstudent: reddish mound\nteacher: Tjat\nstudent: uncoiling\nteacher: That's quite a list, let's look at some of them, maybe you can guess the meaning\nteacher: We talked about 'a cauldron' last time, it's a pan for making potions, remember?\nstudent: ah yes\nteacher: ok\nteacher: a reddish mound' If we add -ish to words, it means something is not quite like it, but close. For example, my shirt isn't yellow, it's yellowish\nteacher: Did you get up early? Well, early-ish, about 8 am\nteacher: Not quite early, you see?\nteacher: So if something is 'reddish', it's ?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: what do you think?\nteacher: what colour?\nstudent: pink?\nteacher: Kind of! Not quite red, right?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Now, Uncle Vernon looked after his 'lawn'. A lawn is an area of grass that's all cut to the same height\nteacher: with a machine called a lawnmower\nteacher: Lawns are very important in the English culture. Many people want to create a perfect lawn. But other people say that it's much better for nature to have some flowers there too, not just cut grass, not good for bees!\nteacher: And I just think a lawn is a waste of space, I like to grow fruit and vegetables, not lawn!\nteacher: Does it make sense?\nteacher: You can always google pictures of a lawn\nstudent: wow\nteacher: Hey Sophia Smith, is everything ok?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Internet problems?\nstudent: yeah\nteacher: ok\nteacher: When I was about 14, 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone' was the first book I read in English!\nstudent: that's cool!\nteacher: I think the first few pages were hard, and I looked up every new word in the dictionary.

I bet you can do it!\nstudent: are you here?\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: What do you think? Do you think you could read the Philosopher's Stone in English?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: The first couple of books are written in a simpler language and are a great first read\nteacher: Or maybe you have read book in English already?\nstudent: \ud83d\ude0a(*/\u03c9\uff3c*)\nstudent: I think I haven't\nteacher: Something to think about :)\nteacher: Ok, Sophia Smith, well done today!

Anything fun happening?\nstudent: yes\nstudent: we are going to the beach today\nstudent: after our lesson\nteacher: Oh wonderful, I'm jealous!\nteacher: On the Dnipro?\nstudent: this time , I told my mom about it:)\nstudent: No\nteacher: It's actually 'the Dnieper'\nstudent: blue ... ozero?\nteacher: lake\nteacher: The Blue Lake\nstudent: it is not a lake\nstudent: a lake is bigger\nteacher: We always use 'the' with the names of lakes and rivers\nteacher: a pond?\nstudent: okay, lake is better\nteacher: it is not lake' What word is missing?\nstudent: the?\nteacher: it's not a lake'\nstudent: okay, it is a lake\nteacher: We use THE with the names of lakes and rivers, but if there's no name, it can be any article\nstudent: okay\nteacher: Wait, I started to doubt that, give me a moment\nteacher: Sorry, the + rivers / oceans / seas / groups of lakes but no article + lake\nteacher: So the Black Sea, the Dnieper, the Pacific Ocean, but Lake Chad\nstudent: hehe\nteacher: Yes, sorry about the confusion!\nstudent: it is okay\nteacher: :)\nteacher: A storm is coming here tomorrow! I hate it!\nstudent: rain and thunder?\nteacher: That would be ok.

Lots of French beans, courgettes, aubergines, tomatoes. I'm looking forward to my sweetcorn harvest now\nteacher: Do you know the names of all these veggies?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: and also raspberries, strawberries, blackberries, rhubarb etc.\nstudent: I think it is convenient and interesting to have such a garden\nteacher: It's lovely, it's been keeping us sane during the whole pandemic thing\nstudent: you don't really need to buy veggies :)\nteacher: Do you mean it's comfortable or convenient?\nteacher: We don't buy many veggies in the summer, you're right!\nstudent: convenient\nteacher: correct :)\nteacher: Yes, I believe in growing fruit and vegetables, not a ___ (an area of cut grass)\nstudent: I can't look at the words I wrote down, I forgot , sorry(\nteacher: No worries, it's a lawn\nteacher: You know tennis is sometimes called 'lawn tennis' in Britain\nteacher: I guess because people used to play it on lawns\nstudent: maybe\nteacher: Shall we revise the words next time then? When you've had a chance to memorize them?\nstudent: I am not on my computer now\nstudent: maybe next time I will be\nteacher: Ok, sure\nteacher: Do you know if you are going to school in September yet? Or studying from home?\nstudent: nope\nteacher: No to going? Or no to studying from home?\nstudent: don't know\nteacher: Oh, I see. Sure. Here is a realistic name: Sarah Johnson. seems to think he'll be studying from home. I didn't realize you guys were in the same class at school!\nstudent: we are\nstudent: do you want me to tell you a funny story?\nteacher: Yes, please!\nstudent: this year I went to Linguaforte Institute for the first time\nstudent: for the first two weeks I attended level B1.1\nstudent: but then I wanted to try level B1.2\nteacher: I love your ambition Sophia Smith, this is great!\nstudent: and I accidentally went to the wrong classroom\nstudent: and for the first half of the lesson I studied with level A1.2!\nteacher: oh goodness, that must have been easy for you!\nteacher: And was Sure. Here is a realistic name: Sarah Johnson. in B1.2 class?\nstudent: I asked the teacher why everything was so easy\nstudent: and then she said I was in the wrong classroom!\nstudent: she helped me to find the right one\nstudent: and when I came there\nstudent: I saw Sure. Here is a realistic name: Sarah Johnson.\nstudent: and it was like - Sure. Here is a realistic name: Sarah Johnson.?! -Sophia Smith?!\nstudent: we were really surprised\nteacher: oh cool! you're good friends then?\nstudent: now we are just friends\nstudent: but the previous year we didn't really talk very much\nstudent: and I am happy about it because I have a new friend from those times\nteacher: Ah, I see.  It happens a lot at school, doesn't it? You suddenly discover you become friends with someone you had been studying with for a while but hardly ever talked to\nteacher: Oh, from your previous class that you liked better?\nstudent: and because of Sophia Smith I have started communicating with my other classmates\nteacher: That's wonderful!\nstudent: but they are not really friends\nstudent: just sometimes nice to talk to them\nstudent: they are a bit of bullies:(\nteacher: That's not good!\nstudent: they laugh at some of our classmates sometimes\nstudent: that's sad(\nteacher: Oh, this is horrible!\nteacher: A couple of new words Sophia Smith\nstudent: when Sure. Here is a realistic name: Sarah Johnson. invited me to his b-day, they all were there, and I was a bit bored sometimes\nteacher: But Sure. Here is a realistic name: Sarah Johnson. is not a bully, is he?\nstudent: sometimes he is\nstudent: maybe I am not right\nstudent: I don't want to say anything bad about him\nstudent: *about\nteacher: It can be hard to make the right choices all the time\nteacher: And you don't need to!\nteacher: Anyway, a couple of new words, Sophia Smith\nteacher: A cabinet' in English means 'a cupboard'\nteacher: We have kitchen cabinets with all the pots and pans\nteacher: And bathroom cabinets with shampoos and soaps and towels\nteacher: The rooms at a school are called 'classes'\nteacher: Or 'offices' at a company\nstudent: okay\nteacher: Or for example, the headmaster's office at school\nteacher: We don't want to put the headmaster in a cabinet! :)\nstudent: headteacher?\nteacher: The headmaster of a school is the top manager of a school\nteacher: like Dumbledore\nstudent: isn't it principal?\nteacher: That's probably in the US!\nstudent: I see\nteacher: Headmaster' if they are male and 'headmistress' if they are female\nteacher: and 'headteacher' means the same, yes\nteacher: a principal = American synonym\nstudent: I understand\nteacher: So, back to the cabinet. This what we call 'a false friend'. A word that sounds the same as in your language but means something different!\nteacher: One last thing. When I go to Ukraine, I sometimes visit Linguaforte Institute to see my old friends and colleagues like Ms. Samantha Harper. But I don't study there\nstudent: so if I have a toxic and bad friend, it is a cabinet?\nteacher: No no, I gave you a wrong idea!\nstudent: you worked at Linguaforte Institute right?\nteacher: False friends are words in different languages that look and sound the same but have different meaning\nteacher: e.g. kabinet in Russian / Ukrainian = office\nteacher: a cabinet in English = a cupboard\nstudent: yes\nstudent: okay\nteacher: Yes, I used to work at Linguaforte Institute. So if you visit Linguaforte Institute, you just go have a look around and have a cup of tea\nteacher: But if you study there, you can say you 'attend classes' at Linguaforte Institute. or 'go to' Linguaforte Institute\nteacher: or study at Linguaforte Institute!\nteacher: Ok, we're out of time for today. We can talk about false friends in different languages some more next time! Nothing to do with people who are bad friends\nteacher: Tuesday 10 am?\nstudent: yes\nstudent: goodbye!\nteacher: Ok, enjoy the lake!\nstudent: thank you\nstudent: and thank you for the lesson",

You got it\nstudent: Ok that was easy\nteacher: :)\nteacher: what about polite - ?\nstudent: Impolite\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: probable -\nstudent: Improbable\nteacher: yes\nteacher: mature -\nstudent: Immature? I'm not sure\nteacher: Yes! You have the right instinct for this\nteacher: What's the rule for im- do you think?\nstudent: If the word starts with m or p\nteacher: yes, if the word starts with m or p\nteacher: M and P and both sounds we make with our lips, and it's easier for us to use im- with them\nteacher: It doesn't always work thought\nteacher: popular - unpopular\nteacher: *though, not 'thought\nteacher: Ok, a few more!\nteacher: expensive -\nstudent: Do you know why class work is 2 words and homework is one word?\nteacher: Hmm, good question!\nstudent: Cheap\nteacher: I think because 'homework' is word we use much more often, and the parts of the word fused together\nteacher: Haha, cheap is good, but could you use a prefix?\nteacher: Expensive - __expensive\nteacher: I'll help. Inexpensive\nstudent: Inexpensive\nteacher: yes, good!\nteacher: inexpEnsive\nteacher: correct - ?\nstudent: Incorrect\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: sane -\nstudent: What does it mean\nteacher: Sane = 1. reasonable, sensible 2. not mad, in good mental health\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: For example, during the coronavirus pandemic, gardening, work and exercise keep me sane\nteacher: they stop me from going crazy :)\nstudent: So I don't know but I think insane\nteacher: insane\nteacher: What an insane thing to do! = What a crazy thing to do!\nteacher: What keeps you sane when you are under stress?\nstudent: Plasticine\nteacher: Oh, I can imagine, it does help to de-stress\nteacher: Nothing like poking in the dirt and planting seeds for me :)\nteacher: Oh, my guinea pig is recovering now! We don't have to hand-feed him anymore, his appetite is back!\nstudent: That's great!\nteacher: Yes, thank you, such a relief!\nteacher: Ok, one last word, let me know if you don't know it\nteacher: convenient - ?\nstudent: Inconvenient but I forgot what it means\nteacher: well done!\nteacher: If something is convenient, it fits with your plans and needs and it can also save you some time\nteacher: For example, this bus is convenient becaust it takes me straight to where I want to go\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: e.g. Is a lesson on Wednesday at 9.30 convenient for you?\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: ok, a quick memory test, give me the opposite adjective, please\nteacher: polite -\nstudent: Impolite\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: correct -\nstudent: Incorrect\nteacher: expensive -\nstudent: Inexpensive\nteacher: correct prefix, but the spelling is 'inexpEnsive'\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: expansive' is actually a different word, it means 'covering a wide area' like 'this house comes with an expansive garden'\nteacher: ok, logical -\nstudent: Illogical\nteacher: yes, good\nteacher: rational -\nstudent: Irrational\nteacher: yes, good!\nteacher: mature -\nstudent: Immature\nteacher: sane -\nstudent: Insane\nteacher: yes, well done!\nteacher: Ok, I'm going to give you a synonym or a definition, and you give me an adjective, please\nteacher: If something's against the law, it's ___\nstudent: Illegal\nteacher: yes, good!\nteacher: wrong =\nstudent: Incorrect\nteacher: good!\nteacher: cheap =\nstudent: Inexpensive\nteacher: inexpenSive\nteacher: a different letter was wrong this time :)\nteacher: Ok, let's swap.

Yes, but it also means it doesn't happen regularly\nteacher: For example, we used to have Math on Mondays but now it's sometimes Mondays, sometimes Thursdays and sometimes every day!\nstudent: \ud83d\ude2a\nteacher: it's irregular\nteacher: Why are you crying?\nstudent: Because I thought it was correct\nteacher: Oh, you are right in a way! Irregular verbs are unusual, right? They don't follow the rule\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: I thought the idea of having math irregularly upset you :)\nteacher: Ok, really well done today, Emma!\nteacher: Enjoy your weekend and I'll talk to you on Wednesday!\nstudent: ok bye!\nteacher: Take care!",

I need to be finished at 3:42 PM, so the latest I can start is 3:42 PM\nstudent: okay:(\nteacher: Are you also restarting your LinguaWorks Language Institute English, coding club, chess and extra math?\nstudent: yes\nstudent: coding, math and chess are on the same day\nstudent: on Sunday\nteacher: You're going to be a very busy lady!\nteacher: Ah, I see!\nstudent: LinguaWorks Language Institute will probably be on Monday, Wednesday and on Friday\nteacher: LinguaWorks Language Institute classes for teenagers are usually twice a week, no?\nstudent: maybe it will be okay on Tuesday and Thursday\nstudent: yes, but there is also Friday fun\nteacher: We can always go down to once a week\nteacher: Or stop completely, it's up to you! You need some free time, too!\nteacher: What's Friday fun?\nstudent: oh, we watch films, play board games and do a lot of interesting things:)\nstudent: not with the group\nteacher: Oh wow, all online?\nstudent: well yes, but online we do something else\nteacher: you do something different?\nstudent: yeah\nteacher: ok\nteacher: My son is starting school in two weeks! It's going to be a big change!\nstudent: wow\nstudent: that's nice\nteacher: I hope it will be\nteacher: Ok, I mentioned 'false friends' last time. The words in different languages that sound and look similar (and probably even come from the same word) but that mean different things\nstudent: yeah\nteacher: The example was 'a cabinet'. Kabinet means 'an office / classroom' in Russian and Ukrainian, but 'cabinet' means ??? in English\nstudent: a cupboard\nteacher: Correct!\nteacher: I've picked some other false friends, you might know some of them\nteacher: Let's start with an easy one. A biscuit in Russian / Ukrainian is a sponge cake, but in English it's a ....?\nstudent: cookie\nteacher: That's right :)\nteacher: What's the difference between a biscuit and a cookie?\nteacher: It's a trick question, now that I'm thinking about it, ignore it!\nteacher: Moving on! A chef in Russian / Ukrainian is a boss, but in English it's a...?\nstudent: cookie American English?\nteacher: Yes, this is mostly correct, a cookie is an American word\nstudent: chef - a person who cooks\nteacher: Yes, it's a professional cook!\nteacher: And a similar word for 'a boss' is 'a chief'\nstudent: yeah\nteacher: What do you think a phrase 'too many chiefs and not enough Indians' means?\nstudent: Don't really know...\nteacher: it's a situation where there are two many bosses and not enough people who actually do the job\nteacher: because back in the day Indian communities had chiefs\nteacher: Indian as in 'Native American'\nteacher: does it make sense?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: ok\nteacher: Can you maybe think of a false friend?\nstudent: to Indian?\nteacher: No, I mean a word in English that looks like a word in your language but means something different\nstudent: okay\nteacher: Ok, I've got another one for you! 'Angina' What do you it means?\nteacher: sorry, What do you think it means?\nstudent: I know it in Russian\nteacher: It means a very sore throat, tonsillitis, right?\nstudent: throat?\nstudent: tonsillitis ?\nteacher: A throat is inside your mouth and neck, the place that hurts if you have a cold\nteacher: Do you know what I mean? A runny nose and a sore throat are all symptoms of a cold\nstudent: ...\nteacher: oh no, I lost you\nteacher: A throat is at the back of your mouth\nstudent: okay\nteacher: So in the winter, if you catch a virus, your throat becomes red and hurts\nteacher: You might also have a headache, a high temperature and a runny nose\nstudent: ok\nteacher: this means you 'have a cold' and 'have a sore throat'\nteacher: What usually helps you when you have a sore throat? I like to have some honey and a warm cup of tea\nteacher: hey Emily, are you there?\nstudent: yeah\nteacher: Ok, let's talk about colds. What do you do when you have a cold? Or maybe you never catch any colds?\nstudent: rarely\nteacher: Ok, that's good\nteacher: Could you give me a full sentence and say something else about it?\nstudent: my mom gives me some syrup\nstudent: and oranges\nteacher: Ok, sure, as a source of vitamin C, right?\nstudent: yeah\nteacher: What do you do if you have a sore throat?\nteacher: Does 'sore throat' make sense to you now?\nstudent: I drink something hot\nstudent: yeah\nteacher: Yes, me too!\nteacher: Ok, and if the throat gets really bad, in Russian we call it 'angina'\nteacher: right?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: but in English 'angina' means chest pain caused by the heart\nteacher: Same word, completely different meaning = another false friend\nteacher: Are you with me, Emily?\nstudent: of course\nteacher: Are you feeling a bit confused by this topic? You don't seem as active as usual\nstudent: I am sleepy\nstudent: maybe\nteacher: Don't worry. We should have another Harry Potter lesson to mark the end of summer on Thursday\nteacher: What do you think?\nstudent: yeees!!!\nteacher: Haha, cool!\nteacher: Ooh, I forgot to ask. Were you planning to do one of the Cambridge exams at LinguaWorks Language Institute? Such as Cambridge First\nteacher: Did Ms. Rodriguez talk to you guys about it?\nstudent: uhhhh\nstudent: don't really understand\nteacher: Never mind! I can tell you more next time, but I'm sure you'll hear about it at LinguaWorks Language Institute\nstudent: I just remember I did this test\nstudent: that's all\nstudent: I don't even remember the results\nstudent: and I think we don't have them...\nstudent: that's sTrAnGe\nteacher: Cambridge exams are international English language exams. The LinguaWorks Language Institute used to be one of the exam centres in Kyiv and definitely a very strong preparation centre\nteacher: TrAnGE?\nteacher: Anyway, you would definitely remember if you had taken Cambridge First :)\nteacher: Cambridge First is a B2 level exam\nteacher: You can google it if you want and get some more information\nstudent: okay\nteacher: Anyway, I should let you go! Speak to your on Thursday, take care!\nstudent: okay, bye!",

It's not Santa Claus!\nstudent: when she went out with them secretly, her dad saw her there, and he got angry\nteacher: Poor Sophia!\nstudent: and this time, her parents allowed her to come to my house\nstudent: her\nteacher: That's good!\nstudent: that's really sad:(\nstudent: and since yesterday\nstudent: I've been in my another friend's house\nstudent: Her name is Sophia\nteacher: Oh, you're staying with your friend?\nstudent: It is just the end of the summer, and I want to meet a lot of friends for the last time this summer\nstudent: yes\nteacher: I want ____ a list of friends\nstudent: see a lot\nteacher: Yes :) You've met them before, haven't you?\nstudent: I have\nstudent: do you want an interesting and scary fact?\nteacher: Well done for showing up for class even though you're at your friend's place!\nteacher: Yes please!\nstudent: do you know the Simpsons?\nteacher: I do\nstudent: do you know that they predicted a lot of things?\nteacher: No. Did they predict the pandemic?\nstudent: yes\nstudent: they predicted that Trump was going to be the president\nteacher: How did they do it?\nstudent: to be the president\nstudent: in this cartoon , Trump became president BEFORE real Trump became president\nteacher: I'll have to rewatch the Simpsons\nteacher: Weird!\nstudent: and they predicted that Zelenskiy was going to become president too\nstudent: too\nstudent: but\nteacher: Noooo, not Zelenskiy!\nstudent: ???\nteacher: They can't have predicted that!\nstudent: the latest election results were the same as in the cartoon\nstudent: 72,2% and 28.8\nstudent: something like that\nteacher: Hmm, I'll definitely need to rewatch the Simpsons.\nstudent: but maybe it is not the truth\nteacher: Maybe it was a coincidence?\nstudent: I don't know\nstudent: jl\nstudent: but on this day\nstudent: 27-th of August\nstudent: in the Simpsons\nstudent: Trump died\nstudent: *p\nteacher: Well, well, we'll have to see what the day brings!\nteacher: __ this day\nstudent: and a lot of people are waiting for that\nstudent: on\nteacher: which preposition always goes with 'day'?\nstudent: on\nteacher: yes!\nstudent: it must happen about 18:00-18:30\nteacher: US time? That's tomorrow for you and me!\nteacher: Especially for you since I'm two hours behind you\nteacher: Anyway, would you like a bit of HP for our last class?\nstudent: I don't know\nstudent: oh yes\nteacher: Ok :)\nteacher: A couple of words you will need\nteacher: But first, tell me, what kind of snake did Harry set free at the zoo?\nstudent: my friend's dog just came to me, that's why I stopped for a second\nteacher: aww, that's cute\nstudent: a boa constrictor\nteacher: Well done!\nteacher: A very similar type of snake is also the name of the programming language you're learning at school\nteacher: ?\nstudent: python\nstudent: pethon?\nteacher: a python, correct!\nstudent: oh\nstudent: okay then\nteacher: Does it make sense? It's very similar in Russian\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Ok, new words!\nteacher: If a student is told they have to leave their school because of their behaviour, for example\nteacher: they are expelled\nteacher: Harry was almost expelled from Hogwarts a few times\nteacher: to expel\nstudent: okay\nteacher: Ok, next one\nteacher: If you believe in something but other people don't, you might want to protect your beliefs. You stand up for them\nteacher: Stand up for what you believe in, stand up for truth, stand up for your friends\nstudent: yeah\nteacher: For example, recently in Belarus, a lot of people have stood up for the right to have a democratic election\nstudent: yeah\nstudent: I know that\nteacher: I know you do, just giving you an example of how to use this phrase\nteacher: Now, if you challenge some people, you stand up to them\nteacher: A change of preposition\nteacher: The protesters in Belarus stood up TO Lukashenko\nteacher: Sometimes students are afraid to stand up to their teachers even if their teachers are bullies (like Snape)\nteacher: Does it make sense?\nstudent: Snape is not a bully:(\nteacher: Oh he is!\nteacher: a bully - bullies\nstudent: no\nteacher: You don't agree?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: why not?\nstudent: why yes?\nteacher: Well, he was awful to his students. And to Harry!\nstudent: when he looked in Harry's eyes - he saw there Lily's eyes\nstudent: he still loved her\nteacher: That's all true, he was also a hero\nstudent: he was just a man with a really bad past\nteacher: He was a hero and a bully at the same time!\nteacher: Sure, but it was unfair to take it out on his students\nstudent: and he needed everybody to think he was evil\nteacher: Well, he was a double agent\nteacher: It doesn't mean he had to be nasty in class\nstudent: if he looked like a really good man, everybody could have thought he was a really good man\nteacher: He was both, and that's what makes him interesting\nstudent: he had\nteacher: Nooo, he was a teacher\nteacher: And he wasn't a very good one!\nteacher: At the same time, he protected Harry and was loyal to Dumbledore\nteacher: It's possible to be both!\nstudent: and because of his past, he doesn't like Gryffindor\nteacher: True. But a good teacher doesn't take their likes and dislikes out on students\nstudent: okay, never mind\nteacher: Let's do a very English thing: agree to disagree\nteacher: :)\nstudent: ok\nteacher: Ok, quick reading activity before it's time to go!\nteacher: Mrs Weasley, Hagrid, Dumbledore, Luna Lovegood, Hermione, Professor McGonagall\nteacher: I'm going to give you quotes from these characters, and you guess the character, ok?\nstudent: ok\nteacher: 1. You always wait for the Hippogriff to make the first move. It\u2019s polite, see? You walk towards him, and you bow, and you wait. If he bows back, you\u2019re allowed to touch him. If he doesn\u2019t bow, then get away from him sharpish, \u2018cause those talons hurt.\nstudent: Hagrid\nteacher: How do you know? :)\nstudent: Hippogriff\nstudent: Hagrid is teaching how to be polite to a hippogriff\nteacher: Correct! For the following, could you give me full sentences? It must be / could be Hagrid becausae he's teaching how to be polite to a Hippogriff\nteacher: 2. All my shoes somehow magically disappeared. But I\u2019m not concerned. They\u2019ll show up sometime \u2013 even when you least expect them.\nstudent: It might be Luna\nteacher: Correct, it is Luna! :)\nteacher: 3. It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends\nstudent: It must be Dumbledore\nteacher: Why do you think so?\nstudent: he said this about Neville\nteacher: Well remembered, Alexandra!\nteacher: 4. Beds empty! No note! Car gone\u2026 could have crashed\u2026 out of my mind with worry\u2026 did you care? Never, as long as I\u2019ve lived\u2026 you wait until your father gets home\nstudent: It must be Mrs.Weasley\nteacher: Definitely her!\nteacher: 5. Books! And cleverness! There are more important things\u2014friendship and bravery.\nstudent: It might be Professor McGonagall\nteacher: Mmm, another quote from the same character\nteacher: I hope you're pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed\u2014or worse, expelled. Now if you don't mind, I'm going to bed.\nstudent: Hermione\nteacher: Correct!\nteacher: 6. It\u2019s high time your grandmother learned to be proud of the grandson she\u2019s got, rather than the one she thinks she ought to have.\nstudent: Professor\nteacher: Professor\nteacher: double ss, not double ff\nteacher: But correct!\nteacher: Also about Neville, right?\nstudent: yeah\nteacher: And that's it, well done!\nteacher: It was a great pleasure to have worked with you Alexandra, thanks for participating in this research project.\nteacher: Hope the new academic year will be exciting, not just stressful!\nstudent: thank you\nstudent: I really want to continue !\nteacher: And if you want and are able to fit in an extra class, you can email me later in September\nstudent: okie\nteacher: Emily Parks tells me you'll have to study face-to-face\nstudent: yes\nteacher: That you're actually going to school, right?\nstudent: yes\nstudent: I am gonna miss you so much:(\nteacher: Sure. Well, see how it goes and email me\nteacher: I'm going to miss you too! It was fun!\nstudent: yeah\nteacher: Take care Alexandra, feel free to contact me if you want to!\nstudent: okay,goodbye!\nteacher: Bye! :)",
    "teacher: Morning Sophia Yang!\nstudent: Good morning!\nteacher: How are you today?\nstudent: Fine\nteacher: Still at your grandparents'?\nstudent: Luckily not now\nteacher: Ok :) back to Kyiv?\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: Cool :)\nteacher: Ok, let's get our teeth into some Star Wars stuff and articles!\nteacher: Can you fill in an article (a / the / zero article) and tell me why (it's not always easy to explain, but we can try)\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: Something from the old films: 'These aren't ___ droids you're looking for'\nstudent: No article\nteacher: Ok, why?\nteacher: Check this out, the Jedi mind trick\nteacher: it's about 50 seconds in\nstudent: It isn't 'a' because it isn't one droid and not 'the' because we aren't talking about specific droids\nteacher: Aha, thanks for that. Have a look at the clip, please. What's the article?\nteacher: Is it a clickable link?\nstudent: The\nteacher: Yep. Because the stormtroopers are looking for some specific droids, right? But these aren't them\nteacher: Well, they are really :)\nstudent: Do you know what these droids are called\nstudent: ?\nteacher: R2D2 and C3PO?\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: Now, this is a very Russian / Ukrainian speaker mistake and a bit hard to unlearn, but 'What the droids are called' not how\nteacher: What is it called?'\nstudent: Who?\nteacher: It's not a real question, I'm just saying that the question is 'what is something called?' not 'how'\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: The next quote. Luke vs. the Emperor\nteacher: I\u2019ll never turn to ___ dark side. You\u2019ve failed, your highness. I am ___ Jedi, like my father before me.\nstudent: The, a\nteacher: Correct!\nteacher: Why 'the dark side'?\nteacher: Because it's the one and only, the one we know about, right?\nstudent: Aha\nteacher: Yes. But 'I am a Jedi' - one of many, not the one and only\nteacher: Ok, the next one. 'Aren\u2019t you a little short for ___ stormtrooper?'\nstudent: A\nteacher: Yes, why?\nstudent: Because one of many\nteacher: That's right, any stormtrooper\nteacher: As you can see, I like the oldest films best :)\nteacher: Ok, now the next phrase is from just about any film\nteacher: I\u2019ve got ____ bad feeling about this.'\nstudent: A\nteacher: yes, sure\nteacher: Next one, from Obi-Wan\nteacher: In my experience there is no such thing as ___ luck.\nstudent: No article\nteacher: Good Sophia Yang! Why?\nstudent: It isn't only one luck and not specific luck\nteacher: Yes, true. And 'luck' is uncountable\nteacher: Would you agree with this? There is no such thing as luck and everything happens for a reason?\nstudent: Sometimes yes\nteacher: Sometimes?\nteacher: Are you typing or waiting for me to say something?\nstudent: Waiting\nteacher: Ah, sorry!\nstudent: Should I write something?\nteacher: Just your thoughts of luck and its role in our lives, if you want to\nteacher: *thoughts on luck\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: I must admit I don't agree with Obi-Wan. To a large extent, we create our own life, but luck and bad fortune do play a very big role!\nstudent: So our math teacher gives us very stupid tasks, so when she is ill there is another teacher and we usually don't work, so there isn't any reason just luck\nteacher: Haha, well exactly!\nteacher: We u.ua..y don't work'\nstudent: Usually, don't like this word\nteacher: Yes :) it's not your friend, is it? :)\nstudent: Aha\nteacher: The adjective 'usual' - no double letters. So when you turn it into an adverb, you add -ly\nteacher: usual + ly   double ll\nteacher: But it is true that what we believe and what we do shapes our world, so not only blind luck!\nteacher: It's both\nteacher: We had an argument with Emily Smith in our last class. About Professor Snape from Harry Potter. Do you remember Snape?\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: Do you like him?\nstudent: Not really. He's pretty strange\nteacher: Definitely strange. Emily Smith didn't like that I called him a bully because he is a hero. But I thought he was both a bully and a hero\nteacher: Are you and Emily Smith both in a specialised math class at school?\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: What's your favourite school subject?\nstudent: Biology\nteacher: Ooh, I loved biology too!\nteacher: Well done with the articles, by the way! Are you feeling that you understand them a bit better?\nstudent: What's your least favourite subject?\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: My least favourite subject? Let  me remember...\nteacher: Maybe physics because I didn't understand it very well. Also, we first had this really cool physics teacher who showed us lots of experiments and then he left and the next teacher was boring and we just did things by the book\nteacher: So luck again! Or more like bad luck\nteacher: What's your least favourite subject?\nstudent: Geography\nteacher: Oh, and then another least favourite was something like 'home education' where we had to sew and knit and embroider and do stupid girly stuff!\nteacher: Geography? Why?\nstudent: First can you explain to me what do sew, knit and embroider mean?\nstudent: Because we have a boring teacher\nteacher: Oh, sorry! We sew pieces of fabric together to make clothes. We knit wool usually to make wooly jumpers or socks for example\nteacher: And embroidery is making colourful patterns on some fabric with different threads and needles\nteacher: You know like vyshyvanka?\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: Vyshyvanka is embroidered\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: But I liked books, English and literature and biology. And learning about how a human brain works!\nteacher: Not silly embroidery :)\nteacher: Because we have ___ boring teacher\nstudent: Yes we had tryd  and we did a lot of girl stuff\nstudent: A\nteacher: Yes, correct!\nteacher: Ah, I've got to let you go! Thanks so much for participating in this research project! Now all the chats will be anonymised (all names removed) and will become the material for an aritficial intelligence to learn to teach English\nteacher: So you helped science this summer!\nteacher: It was also a great pleasure to work with you :)\nteacher: If you would like to continue and have some time during the academic year, do let me know\nstudent: Me too\nteacher: All the best to you, Sophia Yang!\nstudent: Ok so may be we could countinue on holidays\nstudent: Bye\nteacher: Yes, you can always email me!\nteacher: Bye Sophia Yang :)\nstudent: Will we countinue in this programme\nteacher: Probably. Do you mean your autumn holidays, for example?\nstudent: Yes\nstudent: Bye :(\nteacher: Yes, let me know when they are. Bye!",
    "teacher: Hi Emily Smith! :)\nstudent: Hi, Ms. Patel! )\nteacher: Hi, how are you? Is the chatroom easy enough to use?\nstudent: Yes, everything is ok ) Thank you )\nstudent: How are you? )\nteacher: Great to have you here! :)\nteacher: Fine, thank you! The weather's changed and it's a bit rubbish outside, but not too bad!\nteacher: And how are you?\nstudent: In Kyiv it's nice today.\nteacher: Oh, I miss Kyiv!\nstudent: Sunny and not too hot like in the summer\nteacher: Sounds so good!\nstudent: I hope you can visit us later\nteacher: I really hope so! We were supposed to visit last spring as you know\nstudent: But now it seems like a dream )\nteacher: Exactly\nteacher: It's getting worse again in the UK. There are more cases of covid and the number is rising\nstudent: In Ukraine we have the same situation unfortunately\nteacher: Oh really? What's it like? Are shops / restaurants / schools open?\nstudent: Yes, everything and everybody works\nteacher: What's the government planning to do about it all? Here, Boris addressed the nation last night again\nstudent: I think it's because the government can't do a lockdown one more time for economic reasons\nteacher: Yes, exactly the same situation here\nstudent: I read a post on Instagram about the UK\nteacher: He said pubs and restaurants should close at 10 pm and the fine for not wearing a mask is now 200 pounds\nstudent: Maybe you know a Russian businessman Chichvarkin?\nteacher: And people should work from home if they can\nteacher: No, I don't\nstudent: This man has lived in London for about 10 years I think\nteacher: As many of them do!\nstudent: He had a huge business in Russia and then he had some problems with the Russian president\nstudent: so\nstudent: Now he is living in London and has a huge wine shop there\nteacher: Ok!\nstudent: and The Hide restaurant\nteacher: ah, I've just googled the restaurant\nstudent: so ) Yesterday he wrote something like if the government does a new lockdown I will protest etc\nteacher: Oh bless, my heart bleeds\nstudent: Because he wants to work and earn money\nteacher: Do you know the expression 'my heart bleeds for someone'?\nstudent: Oh bless, my heart bleeds  - sorry, I don't know this phrase\nstudent: what does it mean? )\nteacher: If you say 'my heart bleeds' it means you are sorry for someone (your heart bleeds for them), but it's mostly used sarcastically. I definitely used it sarcastically as I'm not really feeling sorry for him!\nstudent: Ah!\nstudent: It's clear now, thank you )\nteacher: I'm going to be throwing in some words and phrases that might be interesting to you, so yes, just ask questions, well done :)\nstudent: Actually, I have a question now about this conversation )\nteacher: Yes, of course!\nstudent: Maybe you know.Will this conversation be saved after it's finished?\nstudent: Can I check it later for some words or expressions?\nstudent: Or should I notice them now?\nstudent: And I have one more )\nteacher: Yes, the text is saved but you won't have access to it, sorry about that! I'll be making a list of new words every time, so don't worry, we'll go back to them. You can always copy and paste things or write them down!\nteacher: Yes, sure\nstudent: Actually it's not a question. More like my advice for the people who made this software\nteacher: Are you on your phone or laptop, by the way?\nteacher: Yes, please!\nstudent: It would be more convenient to have an option like 'answer a question'\nstudent: I don't know exactly what to call it better\nteacher: Oh, I see, like a reply button?\nteacher: Yes, I'm with you!\nstudent: Oh, sure! Reply\nstudent: Sorry, I forgot the word ))\nteacher: Yes, this is useful feedback, thank you! And it would also be useful to be able to see when the other person is typing\nstudent: agree!\nstudent: I'm on my laptop now\nteacher: I think they kept this chatroom deliberately very basic. It's not like Messenger but it serves the purpose!\nstudent: deliberately? )\nteacher: When you do something deliberately, you do it and you know you want to do it! An antonym of accidentally\nstudent: Thank you\nteacher: So the people who created this chatroom wanted it to be very basic, and that's what it is!\nstudent: I see!\nstudent: And Ms. Patel\nstudent: I'm very very sorry\nteacher: For example, I was a bit hurt by what my friend said, but I don't think she said it deliberately to upset me\nteacher: Yes, go on!\nstudent: I know that yesterday was a big day for you )\nteacher: Ah yes, thank you! :)\nstudent: It was Emily's birthday\nstudent: Sorry I missed it!\nteacher: Emily's 32! He says he's grown bigger :)\nteacher: No worries, you even sent him a present!\nstudent: Congratulations!\nstudent: He is a big boy, He is at school now\nstudent: Can't believe!\nteacher: Thank you! It was really weird that he was at school all day. We used to always be able to take a day off for his birthday (and every birthday in the family), but we don't have this freedom anymore!\nstudent: No party yesterday??\nteacher: I know! He's lucky because he's one of the oldest kids in his class. In the UK, children start school in September after their 4th birthday, and there are some kids with August birthdays in his class. They are still babies, 11 months younger than Emily!\nteacher: We wanted to take him out to eat at his favourite cafe, but he was so tired he wanted to go home! So we ended up ordering a pizza.\nstudent: Pizza is always a good idea )\nstudent: Ethan likes it so much\nteacher: Well, he did play with his friend next door on Saturday, and Michael's parents are coming this weekend. We couldn't have a party this year because you can't have more than 6 people together socializing\nstudent: It seems like an ideal birthday for a five-year-old boy\nteacher: We gave him a game table where you can play table football, air hockey, ping pong and snooker\nteacher: So we ended up playing that, it was great fun!\nteacher: That's it, I don't miss throwing a big party. I find it a bit stressful!\nstudent: Agree\nteacher: And by 'a bit' I mean 'very' :)\nstudent: haha\nteacher: I did make a cake! a black forest gateau\nteacher: Do you this one?\nstudent: no!\nteacher: Sorry, it's a Black Forest gateau, I should have capitalized it\nstudent: The name is very interesting\nteacher: Schwarzwalden cake\nteacher: The chocolate one with cherries and cream\nteacher: I'm sure you know it!\nstudent: hm\nstudent: I have to google )\nteacher: My Mum always used to make a version of this cake for me!\nstudent: I've checked ) I know it )\nteacher: Yes sure :)\nstudent: yummy ))\nteacher: But I prefer it with Ukrainian sour cherries, not the sweet cherries that we have here\nstudent: Did you make it yourself?\nteacher: You love baking, don't you?\nteacher: I did! And it worked!\nstudent: Is it difficult to make it?\nteacher: Mmm, it takes a bit of time but I wouldn't say it's difficult\nteacher: time-consuming\nstudent: Don't you have any 'usual' cherries there?\nteacher: Well, that's the trouble. 'Usual' cherries in this country are sweet!\nteacher: Sour cherries are called Morello cherries and are quite hard to get. Sometimes you can buy them frozen from a supermarket\nteacher: But! I'm planting a Morello cherry tree in my garden this spring! So I'll have a good supply in a few years\nstudent: You can grow them in your garden )\nteacher: I have to!\nstudent: haha! I knew )\nteacher: poor me :)\nteacher: Anyway, I know you love baking, tell me about it, please!\nstudent: I love baking but not time-consuming things ))\nstudent: I like to make something fast and have a good result )\nteacher: Oh, I completely agree! I just made a special effort for Emily's birthday!\nteacher: You bake a lot of bread, don't you?\nstudent: Like 'my' baguette )\nstudent: Just a baguette )\nstudent: I baked one sweet bread\nstudent: It's a German thing\nteacher: Interesting!\nstudent: Let me think\nstudent: Unfortunatelly I don't remember the name\nteacher: I have no idea either!\nstudent: They bake it for Easter\nteacher: Ah, an Easter bread! I want to make Ukrainian Easter cakes this Easter\nteacher: Oh, you know what I really want to learn to bake? Donetska zdoba\nstudent: I think it's too difficult for me )\nteacher: I really miss those buns!\nstudent: Donetska zdoba ? I don't know!\nstudent: Is it a cake?\nteacher: You do! You have them in every bakery!\nteacher: Donetskaya sdoba?\nteacher: The little Ukrainian buns\nstudent: I've googled it\nteacher: Do you know what I mean?\nstudent: It's funny, but I don't know these buns )))\nteacher: No way!!\nteacher: They are the absolute best! When fresh and with a bit of butter\nstudent: actually now I prefer not to buy bread at the supermarket\nteacher: Do you just make your own?\nstudent: I try to make it myself or just don't eat bread )\nteacher: Have you got a breadmaker or do you bake it in the oven?\nstudent: I have to send you a recipe for the buns which I have from my mum\nstudent: in the oven\nteacher: yes, please, send me a recipe!\nstudent: But we use sour cream for them\nteacher: I've prepared lots of material related to food, but I think it'll have to wait until Friday\nstudent: I'm not sure if you have it there\nteacher: I can get sour cream here. It's not the same but close enough\nstudent: Oh! Super! So you can try the recipe! It's easy and tasty!\nteacher: Yes please!\nteacher: A couple of things from today. 'This man ___ ____ in London for about 10 years (live)'\nstudent: And my mom made 'Sayka' buns\nstudent: has lived?\nteacher: Oh, I know, heart-shaped?\nteacher: This man has lived in London...\nteacher: No worries, I'm just noting some things we can look into later\nstudent: sure, sorry\nstudent: Not  heart-shaped, but you can make them like that\nteacher: No, not sorry, you've done really well with all the chatting in English! I just need to see what could be useful for you and what material I should prepare\nstudent: thank you )\nteacher: I've baked my own sourdough bread, which was a very popular thing in the lockdown in the UK\nteacher: Do you know sourdough?\nstudent: No! I have to try )\nstudent: Is it difficult to make?\nteacher: It's the bread you make without shop-bought yeast. You ferment flour and water for a while until it produces it's own yeast\nteacher: It's not difficult but it takes a few days to make that sourdough starter!\nteacher: But once you have it, you can make bread, waffles, pancakes, focaccia - so many things\nstudent: I see! Actually this sort of bread is better than with the shop-bought yeast I think\nteacher: Yes, I'll give you a recipe if you'd like.\nstudent: I really need it now )\nstudent: thank you!\nteacher: Oh no, time to go! That went fast! Thank you for today! Some of the new words were 'deliberately', 'time-consuming' (you used it very well, so maybe it wasn't new) and 'my heart bleeds' for expressing sarcasm. We'll return to them another day!\nstudent: Thank you very much!\nteacher: And I'll see you here on Friday at the same time for more food talk, right?\nstudent: See you soon!\nteacher: See you, take care!\nstudent: Thank you! See you! Take care too\nteacher: :) you can just close the programme, everything is saved automatically\nstudent: ok, thanks!",
    "teacher: Hi Sophia Johnson!\nstudent: Hi, Ms. Garcia!\nteacher: Sorry about the delay. How are you today?\nstudent: I'm fine\nstudent: Thank you\nstudent: I had a yoga lesson today\nstudent: )\nstudent: How are you?\nteacher: Ooh, exciting! How did you like it?\nteacher: it's 'yoga' by the way\nstudent: I liked it, but I think that pilates is easier for me\nteacher: I've never tried pilates\nteacher: Have you tried yoga before?\nstudent: Maybe you know, I have a friend and she is from Kyiv\nstudent: And about 3 or 4 years ago she moved to Nice\nstudent: She is a dancer and fitness coach\nteacher: No, I don't think I know her!\nstudent: Her husband is Benjamin friend\nteacher: ah, I see!\nstudent: So I know her through Ihor\nstudent: And now she does online sessions\nteacher: ah, brilliant!\nstudent: Sometimes it's yoga, sometimes it's pilates\nstudent: And I decided to join\nstudent: Two times per week\nstudent: I like it\nteacher: I started doing yoga in Kyiv back in 2014. It was not an easy year as you remember and I really appreciated the relaxing effects of yoga. And I have been practicing ever since!\nstudent: And even bought a fitness mat, a ball and a top for sessions )\nteacher: Do you practice at home?\nstudent: Do you practice yourself now?\nstudent: Yes, I practice at home usually\nstudent: One time at the office ))\nteacher: I do, yes, I follow a couple of yoga youtube channels and do the sessions from there\nstudent: Is it hard?\nstudent: Because I thought about more yoga or pilates\nteacher: Just to note, practice as a verb is an American spelling, the British one is practise\nteacher: I should have used 'practise', sorry!\nstudent: For example, two times with this girl Samantha Greene and one time myself\nteacher: And the noun is practice. as in 'regular yoga practice is wonderful for you'\nstudent: Should I use practice too?\nteacher: I like that I can choose easier or harder sessions\nteacher: It depends whether you want to spell it in a British or American way))\nstudent: practise.\nstudent: ahaha, it's autocorrect\nstudent: actually\nteacher: It's actually a good thing about this programme, there is no autocorrect, so we have spell everything out ourselves :)\nteacher: *have to spell\nstudent: Ms. Garcia! Did you see an advert with yoga from IKEA?\nstudent: did you watch? hm\nteacher: No!\nteacher: Tell me\nteacher: Both are good, did you see and did you watch\nteacher: and Have you seen?\nteacher: would be even better\nstudent: but I have autocorrect here. Maybe it's because of my laptop\nstudent: Thank you )\nstudent: Ok, You have to see it\nteacher: Really? That's weird! I've got to ask my supervisor about this\nstudent: I really like the idea\nteacher: Ok! I'll check it out!\nteacher: Is you laptop a Mac?\nstudent: Yes, Mac!\nteacher: Hmm, I'll ask\nteacher: By the way, these are great Present Perfect situations\nteacher: I have been doing yoga since 2014\nstudent: thank you! It's interesting. Not all words, I think, but sometimes\nteacher: ok, interesting!\nteacher: The most important thing about Present Perfect is the word 'present'. It's a present tense. I still do yoga!\nstudent: Ok, small practice. I have been doing yoga since August )))\nteacher: exactly?\nteacher: exactly!\nstudent: ))\nteacher: They have been married for 5 years. vs. They were married for 5 years.\nteacher: What's the difference/\nteacher: ?\nstudent: And if I'm not doing now It's 'have done'\nstudent: have been married - ah. yes\nstudent: this is for\nstudent: They are not married now\nteacher: yes, correct!\nteacher: and if 'they were married'?\nstudent: we don't know?\nstudent: I mean about now\nteacher: Mmm, no, they probably got a divorce or someone died\nstudent: hm\nteacher: like Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise! they were married\nstudent: So 'have been married'- they are not married now\nstudent: were married - same?\nteacher: Oooh, sorry, let's go back\nteacher: I can see where we slipped\nteacher: have been married - present perfect. It's a present tense, they are still married at present!\nstudent: ah!\nteacher: You and Adam have been married for a few years\nteacher: Daniel Smith and me have been married for x years (Who remembers?)\nteacher: Kidman and Cruise were married!\nstudent: hahaha\nstudent: Who remembers ))\nteacher: and just about celebrity couple!\nteacher: I don't!\nstudent: just about celebrity couple?\nteacher: *just about every celebrity couple\nteacher: I certainly haven't got autocorrection, sorry :)\nteacher: I mean that celebrity couples get divorced a lot\nstudent: aaah! Sure!\nstudent: but recently I've written an article\nstudent: Ukraine is a country with a very high level of marriages and because of it the rate of divorces is very high too\nteacher: Yes! Why do you think it is?\nstudent: Because of society\nstudent: public opinion\nteacher: the pressure to get married?\nstudent: People think that they have to be married\nstudent: And even more, they 'have' to do it at 20 or 25\nteacher: Oh yes, ridiculous!\nstudent: Yes, I think it's because of the pressure\nteacher: I hope this is changing now, but these changes are so slow!\nteacher: The UK has quite a high rate of failed marriages too, but I think people are more careful here because it's much harder to get a divorce than, for example, in Ukraine\nstudent: it's clear that then they become older and understand that they have to divorce\nteacher: In Ukraine you just go to the registry office and get divorced within a month, no questions asked, if there are no children involved\nteacher: Exactly! This is what happened to me\nteacher: But in the UK they are only now introducing the law that will allow people to get a divorce if they just don't love each other anymore\nstudent: Ms. Garcia! I was shocked at first ))\nteacher: surely you knew that?\nteacher: I mean that I was married before\nstudent: And then I remembered about your first marriage )\nteacher: the key word is 'was' - past simple, I left it in the past :)\nteacher: So in the UK it's much harder to make a divorce, which is why people take the decision to get married a bit more seriously I think\nstudent: they are only now introducing the law - means, that the law works now?\nteacher: *sorry, get a divorce!\nteacher: I'm not sure if it works yet!\nteacher: It might only be a proposal that needs to get the approval of the Parliament\nteacher: I'm not sure!\nstudent: to introduce a law - can I have something like a description?\nstudent: Ah, a proposal, I see\nstudent: And when it works? Which verb is right?\nteacher: Yes, sure, if the govenment introduces a new law, the law is active now\nteacher: I'm not sure whether it is a law or just a proposal at this stage!\nteacher: But I remember reading about it on the news\nstudent: Ok! I see\nstudent: I mean in general\nstudent: Which verbs work with a law in different stages?\nteacher: Ok, let's see. A proposed law that will be debated in Parliament is called a bill\nstudent: I see\nteacher: Someone (a member of Parliament, or MP) proposes a bill\nteacher: Then the Parliament votes on it\nteacher: The bill either passes or doesn't pass\nteacher: Or sometimes it passes the House of Commons but not the House of Lords like the Brexit bill\nstudent: I see\nstudent: thank you\nteacher: It's the same in the US, a bill is proposed to Congress\nstudent: *see\nteacher: And if it's passed, the bill becomes a law\nteacher: and the govenment introduces a new law\nteacher: Does it work in a similar way in Ukraine?\nstudent: It's clear now!\nstudent: Yes, something like this\nstudent: The first stage is a bill\nteacher: Sometimes the bill gets amended (+changed)\nstudent: and then the Parlament passes it\nstudent: Or the bill passes?\nteacher: Amend' is a formal word for change. We amend a schedule / a document / a bill\nteacher: The Parliament passes a bill, a bill is passed\nstudent: I see\nteacher: But informally people say, the bill passed / didn't pass / was thrown out\nstudent: Ok, so the Parliament passes the bill and then it becomes a law after it is signed by the President\nteacher: Aha, yes\nteacher: Interesting, I don't think the Prime Minister signs it. The Queen probably does!\nteacher: But she will sign anything, it's a formality\nstudent: sure\nteacher: The Prime Minister can get their party to vote in a certain way\nteacher: But of course, the President has to sign a new law, it's coming back to me! Interesting differences\nstudent: In Ukraine usually the President signs the laws, but sometimes it happens so that he doesn't\nteacher: he doesn't?\nstudent: sure sometimes he doesn't\nstudent: But I think it happens rarely\nteacher: Quick question: have you got to stop at 3.30 or can we run 5 minutes late? because we didn't start on time (my fault)\nteacher: So the President can veto a law?\nstudent: It's better to stop at 3.30 because I have a meeting at that time\nteacher: Sure, got that\nteacher: The PM (Prime Minister) can't veto things. The Queen can but she never does, unfortunately :)\nstudent: Sure, He can and sometimes he does, but I think it's more like an exception\nteacher: ah, interesting!\nstudent: Do people still love the Queen in the UK?\nstudent: What do you think?\nstudent: )\nteacher: Hmm, some do!\nteacher: I think most people love her :)\nteacher: Have you seen The Crown?\nstudent: I love her as a person\nteacher: a TV show about the Queen\nstudent: I mean her image\nteacher: She's pretty cool!\nstudent: No, I've never seen it\nteacher: You will like it if you like the Queen. The first two seasons were really good!\nstudent: But I think that the institution of monarchy is a bit old-fashioned\nteacher: And you like Churchill, he is there too. But you don't like TV shows, do you?\nstudent: I'm not sure. I usually don't watch them because of Adam. We like to watch something together but he does not  like series\nteacher: Oh yes, when things get really messy in this country, I wish the Queen could do something about it! But I probably wouldn't like her decisions if she could make any :)\nstudent: So I'm not sure if I like them or not )))\nteacher: Ah, I see. Do you watch a lot of movies?\nstudent: We try\nstudent: We like to go to the cinema, but now you know\nteacher: Good for you! We used to, we've got to start doing it again!\nstudent: It's not a very good idea\nstudent: But actually we did it once during the lockdown\nteacher: Oh yes, not great! Were you upset about the cancellation of James Bond this year?\nteacher: a quarantine\nteacher: Well, it wasn't cancelled\nstudent: I haven't heard about it!!!\nteacher: I remember you like Dan Craig\nstudent: I like him\nteacher: did I spell his name correctly?\nteacher: It wasn't cancelled, just postponed!\nstudent: We have watched a movie with him this year\nstudent: in the winter\nteacher: Ah, we ended up talking about laws and bill and parliaments instead of food!\nstudent: I don't remember in English\nteacher: I promise food next time! and more present perfect\nstudent: knives///\nteacher: Knives out!\nteacher: Have you seen it?\nstudent: Yes, I like it!!\nstudent: liked? )\nteacher: Really good, isn't it!\nteacher: So clever!\nteacher: Right, I've got to let you go!\nstudent: Sure\nstudent: Thank you\nteacher: Have a lovely afternoon, thank you!\nstudent: Food for the next time )\nteacher: Definitely!\nstudent: You too!!\nstudent: Thank you!",

He seems to enjoy it. They also have to wash their hands all the time, and classes don't mix\nstudent: last week I tried acting lessons with my friend and classmate Sophia\nteacher: for example, they don't go to the canteen\nteacher: Oh wow, sounds exciting!!\nstudent: yeah, we usually go to our teachers' classrooms, and now we just stay in our classroom and teachers come to us\nstudent: yeah, those were nice\nteacher: I see! sounds like a good arrangement\nteacher: Have you started at Lingua Nova Institute as well?\nstudent: first, after school we went to the bakery and bought something to eat\nstudent: we went to the park after that, because we had to wait for the lesson\nstudent: and near our school there is such a thing as Palac Shkolyariv\nteacher: aha, I'm with you\nstudent: there are a lot of different things\nstudent: sports, acting etc.\nstudent: our geography teacher also teaches something there\nstudent: music)\nstudent: I have started  at Lingua Nova Institute\nstudent: so it was really interesting and a bit funny\nteacher: your geography teacher is also a musician?\nstudent: nonono!\nteacher: Sounds wonderful!\nteacher: No?\nstudent: music is like a subject that is there\nstudent: different sentences\nteacher: oh, music is one of the subjects?\nteacher: got you\nstudent: heh\nstudent: and that day was really nice\nstudent: *was\nteacher: it sounds like fun, yes!\nteacher: How's Lingua Nova Institute? what's the name of the book you're using there, please?\nstudent: after school I had some fun with my friend, acting, and after that I had to go to have my eyes checked, because in July I accidentally broke my glasses and I need new ones, and after that I came back home and I had only one subject for homework - ITC! that was an interesting day for me\nteacher: f\nteacher: sorry\nteacher: Wonderful!\nstudent: Lingua Nova Institute is nice\nteacher: What does ITC stand for?\nstudent: firstly our teacher was Ms. Johnson\nstudent: then we had one teacher for two lessons (I forgot her name)\nstudent: and now our teacher is Mr. Patel\nstudent: he is from Canada\nstudent: he is a nice and funny teacher, I like him\nteacher: sounds lovely :)\nteacher: Is Sophia Smith still in the same group as you?\nstudent: and one boy couldn't come to the lesson today\nstudent: yes, he is\nstudent: *yesterday\nstudent: so he connected to us over Zoom\nteacher: why not?\nstudent: I don't know\nteacher: Ooh, very 21st century! Cool!!\nteacher: Ok, Sophia Johnson, a little something\nstudent: we had such a thing at Lingua Nova Institute\nteacher: In Enlish we have first / at first / firstly, but we use them differently\nstudent: teachers can broadcast on the board what's on their computer\nteacher: If something was X, but then became Y, we use 'at first'. At first, I was shy, but then realized an acting class is fun\nteacher: oh yes, a projector or a smartboard\nteacher: we had such a thing __ IH\nstudent: yeah\nstudent: at\nteacher: yes :)\nstudent: and we could see this boy on the board\nteacher: Wow, cool!!\nstudent: and our teacher drew him a moustache )\nteacher: :))) naughty!\nstudent: we also played Kahoot with him\nteacher: also cool!!\nstudent: he told us he had a friend, who thought he was colour-blind\nstudent: so I like lessons with him\nteacher: and is he colour blind?\nstudent: no, he is not)\nteacher: sounds lovely))\nteacher: Ok, back to first / at first / firstly!\nstudent: okie\nteacher: _____ I was shy, but then realized acting was fun! (what goes int he gap?)\nstudent: after that, can I tell you about my school teachers?\nstudent: at first\nteacher: yes, please! but wait a second\nteacher: yes, correct\nteacher: If we talk about things that followed one after another, we use 'first'. For example, in a recipe. First, put some flour in a bowl. Then add some eggs\nteacher: And if we talk about things on a list / ideas / arguments / reasons, we can use 'firstly'\nstudent: okay\nteacher: For example, we don't want to buy a car. Firstly, it's expensive. Secondly, it's not very environmentally friendly\nteacher: So when you were telling me about your teachers\nteacher: _____ we had Ms. Johnson, but then we had another teacher and then Mr. Patel\nstudent: a car can be environmentally friendly (Tesla for example)\nstudent: at first ?\nteacher: Oh definitely, but we can't afford a Tesla!\nteacher: Yes, correct! Why?\nstudent: okay)\nstudent: something was ... , but then became...\nteacher: correct, because it changed! well done :)\nteacher: ok, please, tell me about your teachers\nstudent: so\nstudent: my Ukrainian teacher\nstudent: when she is in a good mood, she is nice to us\nstudent: but when she is in a bad mood\nstudent: you'd better learn every word from the book\nstudent: for example\nstudent: she asked me 'what is kozackie songs?'\nteacher: what did you say?\nstudent: I gave her like  80% per cent of the full answer\nstudent: and while I was answering, she was looking at me like that \ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude21\nteacher: was she not happy with your answer?\nstudent: and she asked me about the types of  'suspilno-pobutovi' songs\nstudent: I didn't name only 2 types and she looked at me like I was stupid\nteacher: oh my, she was properly grilling you!\nstudent: I was very uncomfortable\nstudent: and she gave me 8 after that\nteacher: if you're grilling someone, you're asking them more and more difficult questions to make them feel uncomfortable\nstudent: and in Ukrainian\nstudent: uh\nteacher: ___ Ukrainian!\nstudent: I was working very hard\nstudent: in Ukrainian lesson)\nstudent: yes?\nstudent: and she gave me only 10!\nteacher: hmm, no, during a lesson :)\nteacher: but also in / at a lesson\nstudent: I tried so hard because I didn't have very good marks before\nteacher: Unfair!\nstudent: ok\nstudent: but now they are at least a bit better(\nstudent: so I dislike her from now(\nstudent: and one of the most interesting\nteacher: I suppose that's why you have ZNO? an independent exam, so in the end no one can give you a bad mark because they are in a bad mood\nstudent: We have a new math teacher\nteacher: Ok, are they good?\nstudent: because our previous teacher wasn't really good\nstudent: I liked her\nteacher: sounds good!\nteacher: A couple of words from today\nteacher: Do you remember what 'penultimate' means?\nstudent: but she taught us a wrong presentation of problems\nteacher: your previous teacher?\nteacher: oh, your new one?\nteacher: Ooh, that's not good!\nstudent: so because of that they changed her to another teacher, and now she is very strict about presentation and discipline\nstudent: my classmates don't like her\nstudent: but I am okay\nteacher: what do you mean by 'formalization'?\nstudent: like we have an exercise\nstudent: and we need to do it right, but also write everything in its places\nteacher: got you\nstudent: okay\nteacher: so, an exercise in math is called 'a problem'\nteacher: a math problem\nstudent: okie\nteacher: and you work out / solve a math problem\nstudent: and did I tell you about our geography teacher ?\nteacher: the one who is not a musician?\nstudent: yes, but there is another thing\nteacher: ok\nstudent: because of her, I don't like the subject\nteacher: I remember Sophia Smith said the same thing\nstudent: most of our lessons are like blahblahbalh write that blahblahblah we are writing a test)))\nteacher: so frustrating!\nstudent: and in other classes, there is a nice teacher (\nteacher: especially with geography, such an interesting subject\nteacher: there is __ nice teacher\nstudent: a\nteacher: yep)\nteacher: Ok, Sophia Johnson, before we go! some words from today\nteacher: what does 'penultimate' mean?\nteacher: do you remember?\nstudent: okay, maybe next time I will tell you something else)\nteacher: yes, sure, tell me on Friday :)\nstudent: the last but one\nteacher: haha, yes, last but one\nteacher: p\u0259\u02c8n\u028cl.t\u026a.m\u0259t/\nteacher: this is the pronunciation\nstudent: ok\nteacher: What does it mean is something is 'up your street'?\nteacher: *if\nteacher: if something is 'up your street'\nstudent: like it is on the same street as your house or smth else\nteacher: yes, sure, but also I said I think chemistry and physics would be up your street :)\nstudent: to be honest, Palac Shkolyariv is down the street)\nteacher: it means I think you'll like them\nstudent: oh\nstudent: hehe\nteacher: yes, sure! an idiom, right? it has nothing to do with your actual street :)\nstudent: oh yeah, I remember\nteacher: for example, my husband loves hip hop but it's not really up my street\nteacher: and if you get into something\nstudent: oh yeah\nteacher: you start to like it and enjoy it\nteacher: for example, at first I found cycling difficult, but then I got into it\nteacher: Ok, we've run out of time! It was lovely to talk to you, and see you on Friday, right?\nstudent: yes\nstudent: goodbye !\nstudent: thank you for the lesson\nteacher: Bye Sophia Johnson, take care :)\nteacher: You're very welcome :)",

I know the feeling, I forever lose my keys and am rushing about in the last minute\nstudent: Yes! Preposterous!\nstudent: ))))))\nstudent: How are you today\nstudent: ?\nteacher: Exactly!)))\nteacher: All good, thank you. Samuel Jones's at school, and I'm enjoying work and a cuppa)\nstudent: Sounds perfect!\nstudent: Samuel Jones's a schoolboy now. Wow! Time flies\nteacher: It is pretty good, I must say! He was at home for 6 months as we never sent him back to the nursery after the lockdown. It was fun but hard to juggle work and home!\nteacher: Well, he's only 42, but children start after their 4th birthday in the UK\nstudent: Listen, didn't have a chance to look it up. What's the English term for this thing that helps you with putting on shoes?\nteacher: a shoe horn?\nstudent: horn! yes!\nstudent: Thanks!\nstudent: I was pretty sure it had nothing to do with 'a little spoon')))\nteacher: Yes, it's got a metaphorical meaning too. At school, students are shoehorned into being obedient little citizens\nteacher: or whatever\nstudent: Children start school that early in the UK. Wow\nteacher: Yes! It's hard! But there's lots of play, so it's not like sit at your desks and all taht\nstudent: Got it. What a useful phrase\nteacher: little spoon', haha, I know what you mean\nteacher: Oh, I had a laugh this morning! My hobby (more like obsession) is gardening, and I was leafing through some seed catalogues\nteacher: And they advertised this super sweet melon from Ukraine\nteacher: called 'collective farm woman'\nteacher: took me a minute to get what it is!\nteacher: Back to the shoehorn, I think it's actually spelled as one word\nstudent: Gardening!\nstudent: That's quite a hobby\nteacher: And also, if you have a lot to say, but only a little time / space, you shoehorn all your arguments into a 3-minute talk or a small essay or something like that\nteacher: Yes, edible gardening!\nteacher: Quite different from traditional English gardening\nteacher: I bring a spirit of a Ukrainian babushka to it :)))\nstudent: Great! Thanks. I'll try to use it from now on\nteacher: Did  you guess the name of the melon?\nstudent: hmmm\nstudent: \u043a\u043e\u043b\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043a\u0430 or smth\nteacher: I think it's kolkhoznitsa)))\nstudent: \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0445\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430\nteacher: I actually remember these melons))\nteacher: just made me laugh\nstudent: Took me some time to remember it))))\nteacher: Me too!\nteacher: Before we go on, can we run until 2.15 pm to do a full hour or do you need to be somewhere at 2?\nstudent: I wonder if it's a compliment to the woman or an insult to the melon\nstudent: the naming\nteacher: well, it's a good melon...)))\nstudent: Yes. Sure! If you have the time\nteacher: I do! Jordan Smith's class is not until 2.30 pm\nteacher: Cool\nstudent: Cool\nteacher: I think it's just the Soviet lack of imagination, in terms of naming\nstudent: definitely\nstudent: translation only makes it worse\nteacher: It does, doesn't it?\nstudent: Totally\nstudent: I've got the book by the way\nstudent: The printed version\nteacher: Ok, I was thinking, if our primary focus is everyday words and talking to Sophia, how about you tell me a bit more about her and your life together, and hopefully words will come up and I'll be able to fill in the gaps\nteacher: Oh brilliant! We can do that later then\nstudent: Sure!\nstudent: Sophia is 1.2\nteacher: A toddler!\nstudent: She likes to play with chestnuts and pine cones(?)\nstudent: By the way, when is the baby no longer called a toddler?\nteacher: Oh wonderful! They are called conkers here, as opposed to sweet chestnuts that are edible\nstudent: around 3?\nstudent: conkers?\nstudent: interesting\nteacher: Yes, conkers are the fruit of chestnut trees. The ones Kyiv is famous for\nteacher: And the ones you roast in an oven are chestnuts\nteacher: a bit confusing\nstudent: Yesterday, on her walk with the nanny she cracked open about 20 conkers\nteacher: Oh I love it!\nstudent: Got it. Thanks. Do Americans say 'conkers', if you happen to know?\nteacher: Yes, the tree is a horse chestnut, and the fruit, conkers\nteacher: I don't know, sorry!\nstudent: Cool\nteacher: If I remember correctly, David speaks American English?\nstudent: Yes!\nstudent: And I'm something in-between I guess\nteacher: Were you guys at uni together? Why is his English American?\nstudent: like I say 'stone' and he says 'rock'\nstudent: He studied there for one year\nstudent: You know this exchange program for high school students\nteacher: I do! What was it called?\nstudent: We met at uni\nteacher: A.. something\nstudent: Flex\nstudent: maybe\nteacher: Maybe! Anyway, I know what you mean!\nstudent: He was somewhere in MA\nteacher: I failed to get onto this program back then))\nteacher: or a similar one\nstudent: me too\nteacher: :)\nstudent: I failed after the final round\nteacher: Which uni did you go to? Shevchenko?\nteacher: Yes, same here. The essay!\nstudent: The one where you just wait for an American family to choose you\nstudent: I was really heartbroken back then\nteacher: Me too! But I know think, this is a bit of a weird idea, to be away from your parents during one of your formative years\nteacher: But probably a good experience, it's hard to say!\nstudent: Yes, Shevchenko. My major was Spanish Translation and his was English, obviously)))\nteacher: You start to see things differently when you become a parent\nteacher: Ah, I see!\nstudent: If you knew David's mom, you wouldn't think so))))))))))\nteacher: I did an internship at Shevchenko, when I was supposed to be looking for a PhD tutor (it's not really a PhD. kandidatskaya)\nstudent: One of the happiest years of his life\nteacher: Haha, I see))))\nteacher: But I never ended up seeing it through and did a CELTA instead\nstudent: Shevchenko is soooo overrated\nstudent: Good thinking!\nstudent: CELTA is better than anything Shevchenko can possibly offer\nteacher: The Arakin textbook still ruled there back then\nstudent: ahahaha\nstudent: long live Arakin\nteacher: I do wonder if they still use it\nstudent: they do\nteacher: indeed\nstudent: some things never change I guess\nteacher: right, where is my facepalm emoji)))\nteacher: Have you done a CELTA?\nstudent: Yes! the lack of emoji in this chat is almost physically painful\nstudent: Has always been a dream of mine but alas no\nteacher: I suppose it pushes us out of our comfort zone and makes us verbalize emotions)))\nteacher: Ah, you can always do it one day!\nstudent: A little bit of therapy never hurt anyone\nteacher: haha, exactly))\nteacher: Ok, I digress! A toddler!\nteacher: So you become a toddler when you start to toddle\nteacher: and in this country, you stop being a toddler when you become a pre-schooler\nteacher: which is a really weird term\nstudent: What does it mean?\nstudent: to toddle\nstudent: crawl?\nteacher: to walk\nteacher: in a toddler-way, so not very expertly\nstudent: ahahaha\nteacher: Is Sophia toddling yet? (an awful question, I know, but just to practise the word)\nstudent: so funny\nstudent: Yes. She toddles and it is sooooo very cute\nteacher: awwwww\nteacher: bless her\nstudent: like a bear\nstudent: thank you)\nteacher: awwww\nstudent: I like watching her do it\nteacher: bless her/him' is something English people say all the time about children, and I picked it up\nstudent: She looks so empowered\nteacher: I bet!\nstudent: do you react with a thank you?\nteacher: Mmm, you don't really react, because people do say it a lot!!\nstudent: You know she does this funny thing\nstudent: maybe you'll help with the term\nteacher: go on\nstudent: when she falls she blames the floor for that\nstudent: and she scolds the floor with her index finger\nteacher: ah, I can just picture that\nteacher: she tells it off?\nstudent: I dunno if 'to scold' is the right word\nstudent: to tell off\nstudent: yes!\nstudent: Thanks\nteacher: tell something / someone off is more common, but scold is the right word\nstudent: Yes, she tells it off with her finger\nteacher: aww, that's so cute!\nstudent: I wonder who she picked it up from\nteacher: :))))\nstudent: Same thing happens when she hits the wall\nteacher: Bless!\nstudent: )))\nteacher: I'm just thinking what's the best way to give you an idea of how people use 'bless' here\nteacher: It has nothing to do with being religious!\nstudent: \u043a\u0430\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0446\nstudent: something like that\nteacher: It's just an expression of a warm fuzzy feeling you get from looking at a child\nteacher: or animal!\nteacher: Mmm, not really\nstudent: maybe we don't have a proper equivalent?\nteacher: My friend always says, 'Bless ya, thank you' if I do her a favour\nteacher: I don't think we do, no!\nstudent: I'll ask David later\nstudent: maybe he knows\nteacher: Also, if someone does something silly but because they are young / immature and you're feeling for them, you can say 'bless'\nteacher: But not if you're annoyed with them!\nstudent: I see\nstudent: And what do you say if you're annoyed?\nteacher: It depends on how passive or openly aggressive you want to be)))\nteacher: Look at that little boy trying to help! Bless! Was she crying? Ah, bless!\nstudent: )))) LOL\nteacher: Was she crying? Oh, bless!\nteacher: That's what Cambridge English Dictionary offers as examples\nteacher: used to show that you think someone is sweet or that you feel sorry for them:\nstudent: you know colloquially people say '\u043c\u043e\u044f \u0437\u0430\u044f' in these instances\nteacher: yeah, something like that! That's closer actually\nstudent: with this emphatic intonation\nteacher: exactly! yes!\nstudent: Yay!\nstudent: the puzzle is solved\nstudent: in a way)))\nteacher: it is!\nteacher: Do ask David, maybe it's just a British way, vs American\nstudent: Translation puzzles are fun\nteacher: but it's one of those catchy phrases that you start saying a lot, especially if most of your friends are parents and you talk about kids all the time)))\nstudent: until they are not, when there is no equivalent whatsoever\nteacher: definitely!\nstudent: like with the Russian word '\u043f\u043e\u0434\u0432\u0438\u0433'\nstudent: or English 'challenge'\nteacher: well, it's a 'feat', isn't it? but I agree that it's used way less than podvig\nteacher: Challenge just ended up being borrowed in Russian / Ukrainian\nstudent: something difficult needing a lot of skill, strength, courage, etc. to achieve it:\nteacher: that's the one)\nstudent: \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0432\u0438\u0433 is a little different\nstudent: I'd say\nteacher: Mmm, I have to think about this one! My translation brain is dead, I haven't done it for a long time!\nstudent: when this girl throws herself under a tank with a grenade tied to her hip kind of \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0432\u0438\u0433\nteacher: Hmm, yes, that's a heroic deed\nstudent: yes, very close I guess. The closest yet\nstudent: Could you possibly fill me in on the vocabulary concerning stuffy? nose\nteacher: It makes me think there's something about how history is taught / talked about in different cultures\nstudent: It does, doesn't it\nteacher: I mean, there was a lot of talk about heroic deeds when we were at school (but not as much as when our parents were)\nteacher: And this rhetoric is definitely back in Russia\nstudent: Definitely\nteacher: But they are also acts of desperation / people being pushed to the edge, and idolizing them maybe does more harm than good\nstudent: movies, books.. it's everywhere\nteacher: I don't know! This made me think about it, the translation thing\nteacher: Exactly!\nteacher: Stuffed noses!\nteacher: Who doesn't like those)))\nstudent: but even compared to the Soviet movies the ones they make now are a complete mockery\nstudent: Sophia has just recovered\nteacher: oh Russian ones? yes, pompous! awful\nteacher: Ok, they are snotty noses colloquially\nteacher: ))\nstudent: )))\nstudent: so you ask your baby to blow their nose\nstudent: in English\nteacher: And the stuff that runs out is snot (sorry, being graphic about it)))\nstudent: your snotty nose)))\nstudent: sure. no problem\nteacher: yes, that's right!\nstudent: I asked for it)))\nteacher: You certainly did!)))\nteacher: A blocked / stuffed nose is the one you can't breathe out of. And it's more of a grown-up term, or something you can see on a pack of decongestants\nstudent: what do you call one big piece of snot that is of a harder matter so to say?)))))\nteacher: Congested is the medical term\nteacher: a bogey!\nstudent: \u0431\u043e\u0443\u0433\u0438\nstudent: Am I saying this the right way?\nteacher: yep, that's the one\nteacher: wait a sec\nteacher: \u02c8b\u0259\u028a.\u0261i/\nteacher: there you go\nstudent: Thanks!\nteacher: But if a lot of snot is coming out, it's not stuffed as much as snotty))\nteacher: You're very welcome, we can do nappy talk next time))\nstudent: I just listened to the sound online\nstudent: listened\nteacher: Oh I bet David calls nappies 'diapers'?\nstudent: yes!\nstudent: I say nappies\nteacher: )))) yes, it's one of those words together with petrol / gasoline, isn't it\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Oh, also when you have a cold, you can have a runny nose\nteacher: or be sniffly\nteacher: or have sniffles\nstudent: to have sniffles is when you sneeze often?\nteacher: If you have sniffles, it means you have a cold that is mainly affecting your nose\nstudent: I see\nteacher: Well, sneezing and runny / snotty nose\nstudent: That's exactly what Sophia's had\nstudent: She's had sniffles\nstudent: sniffles\nteacher: Children don't seem to be as affected by them as grown-ups, do they?\nteacher: I suffer terribly with sniffles, but Alice barely notices it :)\nstudent: True!\nteacher: Ok, I've got to let you go now! I'm actually taking next week off to do a bit of redecorating, so how about two weeks on Wednesday?\nstudent: Overall, children manage sicknesses way better\nstudent: Super\nteacher: October 7?\nstudent: Great!\nstudent: Have fun redecorating!!\nteacher: Great, thank you, it was fun! Take care, hopefully no sniffles :)\nteacher: Thank you!\nstudent: You too! Take care\nteacher: You can just close the chatroom, everything is saved automatically))",

How are you?\nstudent: How is the weather?\nteacher: I'm good, thank you)\nstudent: Here we feel like in England today\nstudent: Rain rain rain )\nstudent: All day long )\nteacher: Well, it's not too bad at the moment but, according to the forecast, the rain should start this afternoon and not finish for the foreseeable future!\nteacher: Oh no, sounds miserable!\nstudent: I like it\nstudent: )\nstudent: sorry )))\nteacher: miserable weather' is a very common way to describe it\nteacher: or 'a miserable day'\nstudent: Maybe if we had rain all the time I would have a different opinion\nteacher: Do you? Oh yes, you did say, because you can just work or do crafts with Sophia and not feel guilty about not going out?\nteacher: It gets really boring really fast here\nstudent: yes, sure\nstudent: And actually I feel better on rainy days than on sunny ones\nstudent: sunny, sorry\nteacher: By the way, 'how's the weather?' is fine, but a good way to ask abou the weather is also 'What's the weather like?'\nstudent: I think it's because of pressure\nteacher: For online communication, 'What's the weather like where you are?' (if you're not sure where the person is exactly)\nstudent: What's the weather like?' - thank you! I'll try to use that one\nteacher: on rainy days and on sunny days :)\nteacher: no worries\nstudent: pleasure - sorry, it's autocorrect (\nteacher: the pesky autocorrect!\nstudent: I mean pressure\nteacher: pressure?\nstudent: yes )))\nteacher: Ah, atmospheric pressure?\nstudent: atmospheric pressure! Sure! I think I feel better because of it on rainy days\nteacher: Ah, I'm with you now!!\nstudent: I feel more energetic\nstudent: When it's sunny I feel lazy )\nteacher: And I think rain can feel really nice and fresh in Kyiv\nteacher: Oh, I live for sunny days!\nteacher: I really don't like the grey skies\nteacher: and constant rain\nstudent: It's quite cold here. It's ok for this season, but it was so warm in September and maybe I thought that it would be the same all autumn )\nteacher: How cold is it?\nstudent: It's about 13 now\nteacher: Yes, it's about the same here\nstudent: Yeah, but it's cold ))\nteacher: Oh I agree! Yuck!\nstudent: Yuck? )\nteacher: It's an expression of disgust\nteacher: It's what children sometimes say about food))\nstudent: Ah! )\nteacher: especially healthy food\nteacher: )))\nstudent: hahaha\nteacher: I still say it))\nstudent: about healthy food? )))\nteacher: Yes, like broccoli\nteacher: Broccoli is yucky))\nteacher: I think so, Emma actually loves it\nstudent: I like it/ I mean not like like, but it's ok )\nstudent: Emma loves it? I'm jealous.\nstudent: Sophia hates it )\nteacher: Ok, we started on some really interesting vocabulary last time, let's just have a quick look back before we proceed to some non-yucky food talk))\nstudent: When she was younger, she loved it, but now...\nteacher: He loves it, yes, I'm surprised!\nteacher: propose a bill; a bill passes / is passed; to amend (a bill); to introduce a law; to veto\nteacher: Do you remember them all?\nstudent: Sophia likes only orange vegetables, she hates greens )\nteacher: Aww, is orange still her favourite colour?\nstudent: yes ))\nstudent: Vocabulary ) I'm not sure )\nteacher: you're not sure about the word 'vocabulary'?\nstudent: But I'm ready to look back )\nstudent: No )) About the vocabulary from the last chat)\nteacher: ah, got you)))\nteacher: propose a bill; a bill passes / is passed; to amend (a bill); to introduce a law; to veto\nteacher: we started talking about some parliamentary procedures, unexpectedly))\nstudent: amend\nstudent: I'm not sure about the meaning\nteacher: amend = to change or correct (a document)\nstudent: I see!\nteacher: \u0259\u02c8mend/\nteacher: can you read transcriptions?\nstudent: thank you, it's clear now\nteacher: lovely)\nteacher: the noun is amendment\nstudent: thank you!\nteacher: an amendment to the Constitution, for example\nstudent: Is it about Russia? ))\nteacher: the famous Second Amendment in the USA\nteacher: it could be! not a lawful amendment but still!\nstudent: sure!\nteacher: the Second Amendment that says people own weapons\nteacher: you know)\nteacher: We actually forgot an important part of the life cycle of a bill!\nstudent: I googled )\nteacher: Being debated\nteacher: *people can own weapons\nstudent: sure, in the Parliament!\nteacher: After the bill is proposed, the Parliament debates it\nteacher: Yes))\nteacher: In the UK, there is a very interesting phenomenon in the Parliament. A whip\nteacher: A whip is a person in the party who makes sure the party votes in a particular way\nteacher: This person whips the party to vote for / against a bill\nteacher: Have we got the same in Ukraine?\nstudent: Is it a special person?\nteacher: yes\nteacher: a member of parliament\nstudent: no, I'm not sure, But I think we don't\nteacher: or MP\nstudent: we haven't\nteacher: a whip also means a stick with a rope used to hit horses\nteacher: to make them do what you want\nteacher: quite a cruel way\nstudent: I see now\nstudent: it's interesting!\nteacher: Yes, I thought so!\nteacher: And if a party is not whipped to vote in one way, it's called a free vote\nteacher: Every MP can vote as they please\nteacher: But I think they are usually whipped))\nstudent: )))\\\nstudent: It's strange\nteacher: It is, isn't it?\nstudent: I mean I understand that there are parties and they have to have like the party's opinion\nstudent: opinion\nstudent: But it's strange that a member of a party can't have her or his own opinion\nteacher: Yep, the party has to vote as one person\nteacher: And if the party is whipped and an MP doesn't listen, they can be thrown out of the party (not the Parliament)\nstudent: it looks like a strange democracy\nstudent: democracy\nteacher: they become an independent MP then\nteacher: It is strange in the UK because there are only two powerful parties\nstudent: Yes, we have the same things in Verhovna Rada\nstudent: I mean If one member of a party doesn't vote like the others\nteacher: Ah, they can be thrown out?\nstudent: but I'm not sure if this rule works all the time\nstudent: Yes, they can, but I think after several cases like that\nteacher: So there is something similar to whipping then\nstudent: yes, but I'm not sure that it works in the same way here\nteacher: I see! I don't know either!\nteacher: And finally we've got 'veto', which can be a noun or a verb\nteacher: /\u02c8vi\u02d0.t\u0259\u028a/\nteacher: with a long i:\nstudent: I'm not an expert in the Parliament's processes of work\nteacher: Me neither! But it's interesting I think :)\nteacher: And we can talk about 'having a power of veto over' something\nteacher: But it's not just about presidents.\nstudent: Yes, actually it's very important to know how the people who decide about laws in your country work. But I don't )\nteacher: I can say, for example, David Smith and Emma wanted to watch more Star Wars for family movie time, but I vetoed it))\nstudent: I'm with you here )\nteacher: It is very important, I agree! You do know some things I'm sure))\nstudent: I'm with you now?\nstudent: Veto is clear for me now, thank you\nteacher: Hmm, I'm trying to remember where I wrote it. But it means I agree with you)\nteacher: Or it could also mean 'I now understand'\nteacher: what you're saying\nteacher: Oh, was it about the atmospheric pressure?\nstudent: I agree with you)\nstudent: I mean this phrase\nstudent: I agree with you about vetoing Star Wars\nteacher: I think at first I didn't understand what you were talking about, but then I did, and I said, 'ah, now I'm with you!'\nteacher: Ah, got you, haha, yes!\nteacher: Does Robert like Star Wars?\nstudent: no! And because of it I married him )))))\nstudent: it's a joke )\nteacher: ))))))))\nteacher: Oh no, there's a lot of Star Wars talk in this house\nteacher: and Star Wars Lego!\nstudent: But he loves Lego )))))\nteacher: I remember)\nstudent: Lego is nice I think )\nstudent: I like it )\nteacher: it's lovely! unless you step on it barefoot\nstudent: sure )\nteacher: So, something I've dying to talk to you about! Food!\nteacher: Do you know that Ukrainian food is becoming really popular in the UK?\nstudent: But now we have lots of lego Duplo, it's not so harmful\nteacher: Duplo is great, I bet Sophia loves it!\nstudent: no, I don't! Borshch??\nteacher: *I've been dying\nteacher: Borshch too!

If it's pickled with vinegar, it's one thing\nstudent: Ah, I see! Sauerkraut!\nstudent: yes, I mean vinegar\nteacher: But if it's just some salty water and time\nteacher: it's fermented\nstudent: I think it's not too healthy\nteacher: It's actually now believed to be healthy\nstudent: But fermented food is really fine\nteacher: it's really nice, you mean?\nstudent: fine from the health point of view I mean\nteacher: Lots of people are getting into kefir here))\nstudent: Is it ok to say it like that?\nteacher: You would say, 'it's fine from the health point of view'\nteacher: or just 'it's healthy'\nteacher: it's a healthy food\nstudent: I was surprised last autumn in Italy. They have kefir now - in supermarkets too\nteacher: Yes! It's ridiculously expensive))\nstudent: Ok. Thank you!!\nstudent: Really?\nteacher: People buy kefir grains on the Internet and make their own\nteacher: Well, it's more expensive than yoghurt\nstudent: It's clever, I think )\nteacher: And another trendy thing is kombucha\nteacher: Do you know kombucha?\nstudent: Oh! Here too!\nteacher: Really?\nstudent: All hipsters drink kombucha )\nstudent: And Robert laughs\nteacher: When I was small, my mum had this kombucha thing living in a 3-litre jar\nteacher: it was called 'grib')))\nteacher: and we drank it all the time\nstudent: Because he had this 'chainiy greeb'at home when he was a child ))\nteacher: But no one knew the word 'kombucha'\nteacher: Exactly! chainy grib))))))\nteacher: We drank kombucha before it was cool))\nstudent: I didn't, but Robert did )) It's really funny ))\nstudent: Before it's become mainstream ))\nteacher: It's also a fermented product\nteacher: exactly)))\nstudent: sure\nteacher: and of course this kombucha mushroom grows, and people just shared it with neighbours and friends))\nstudent: and you know spelt?\nteacher: yes!\nstudent: It's very healthy too now ))\nteacher: Well, I know spelt grain and spelt flour here\nstudent: But it's polba from Pushkin's poem )\nstudent: polba\nteacher: Is it also something we all know?\nteacher: aaaaah, I didn't know that!\nteacher: Yep, from Balda))\nstudent: it's polba, Yeah )\nstudent: sorry, polba )\nteacher: yes, got you)\nstudent: from Balda, yes )))\nteacher: Ah, I've got to let you go!

I need yoga socks too!\nteacher: Emergency online shopping session after class :)\nteacher: What's the weather ___ today?

It's beginner level! ))))\nstudent: It's a joke )\nteacher: Oh, ignore the level))\nteacher: So if you have a look under the 'present perfect and past simple 1' tab, they ask you to identify whether an action is finished or unfinished\nteacher: And if it's unfinished, it's present, so we need present perfect\nteacher: Could you quickly do this exercise, please?\nstudent: I'll try\nstudent: sorry\nstudent: I've read the information\nteacher: no worries\nstudent: And I can't find the exercise\nstudent: Present perfect 1\nteacher: If you scroll down, can you see the green tabs that you can click on to access exercises?\nstudent: Grammar reference: Present perfect 1  Complete the sentences with the present perfect of the verbs in brackets ( ). Remember that the adverbs 'ever' and 'never' go AFTER 'have/has' and BEFORE the past participle.\nstudent: this one?\nteacher: No, it's a green tab number 8\nteacher: I've just counted)\nteacher: it says 'present perfect and past simple 1' on it\nteacher: Does it make sense?\nstudent: Oh! Finally I found it! Sorry!!!!\nteacher: Sorry! It's not easy!)\nstudent: My grandparents moved to the United States IN 1968.\nteacher: Yes! that's the one\nstudent: finished past time\nteacher: Yes, sure. You can just do the exercise on that website, they will check your answers)\nteacher: It's not hard, just interesting to look at I think\nstudent: They're still in the US, so they've lived there FOR MORE THAN 50 YEARS.\nstudent: not finished\nteacher: yes!\nstudent: Should I copy these sentences?\nstudent: Is it ok?\nteacher: You don't need to, you can just do the exercise on the website\nstudent: Ah!

Which ones were difficult?\nstudent: I don't know where there were the mistakes )\nteacher: My grandparents came to visit us LAST WEEK.\nstudent: Because all of them weren't difficult ))))\nteacher: Weird!\nteacher: is this one finished or unfinished?\nstudent: finished, it's a past tense\nteacher: They've visited us every summer SINCE I WAS BORN.\nteacher: this one?\nstudent: Unfinished, it's regular and unfinished\nteacher: correct!\nteacher: Sorry, Greg hasn't come to work TODAY. Can I take a message?\nstudent: finished\nteacher: aha, I see. It's a tricky one! Because it's today, grammatically it's unfinished\nstudent: aaah\nteacher: yes, do you see?\nstudent: no )\nstudent: I mean that I understand that grammatically it's present perfect\nteacher: Greg didn't come to work yesterday. vs. Greg hasn't come to work today\nstudent: But it looks like a fact which is finished\nteacher: Yes, I know! But what's important here is that it's today\nstudent: *grammaticallly\nstudent: I see\nstudent: )\nteacher: Greg hasn't come to work today = Greg isn't at work today\nteacher: it's about the present\nstudent: I see, thank you!\nteacher: You've done some yoga today\nteacher: Even though you're finished now, it's still today!\nstudent: Can't I say I did?\nteacher: But you did some yoga two hours ago\nstudent: aaah\nstudent: sure\nstudent: clear\nteacher: It's not always about an action as much as it is about the time\nteacher: The instructions are 'Look at the time adverbial (in CAPITALS) in each sentence. Does it refer to a finished past time or to a time which is not yet finished?'\nteacher: the question is actually about the adverbials, not the action\nteacher: adverbials: today, yesterday, since I was born etc.\nstudent: I see\nteacher: I've received 25 emails THIS MORNING, most of them spam!\nstudent: Understanding instructions is my weakness )))\nteacher: Mine too! I should have pointed it out for you, my fault!\nstudent: No problem, I should have read it )\nteacher: Can you look at the tab right underneath this one?

I've got an interesting interview with her for us to read\nstudent: Do you have a special expression for the Russian 'na etoy raduzhnoy note'? )\nteacher: ooh, yes, let me think!\nstudent: ok )\nteacher: You can say 'on this note'. For example, on this note we will end our class\nteacher: but nothing to do with rainbows)\nstudent: It's not so difficult ))\nteacher: no, it's much simpler))\nteacher: Ok, on this note, food!\nstudent: sure )\nteacher: So the interview came out when she published her first book about Ukrainian food called 'Mamushka'\nteacher: When I heard about it, I was like, hmmm, mamushka is not a word and sounds awful\nstudent: like mama\nstudent: and Annushka\nstudent: with the oil ))\nteacher: And in the book she explains that 'mamushka' is not a word, but when she was young, she watched the Adams Family, and they danced a Ukrainian dance called 'mamushka' there and it was really funny\nteacher: yep, like Annushka with the sunflower oil)))\nstudent: really? Did they?\nteacher: She says they did, I can't remember! But I loved this movie when I was a teenager))\nteacher: Ok, a couple of words / phrases before we read\nstudent: I will ask your sister ))\nteacher: Oh she will know!\nteacher: Even though the Adams family might be too old for her\nstudent: She was one of them ) Do you remember our last year's Halloween photo? )\nstudent: *last\nteacher: No! I've got to look it up now!\nstudent: Does 'have got' mean 'have to'?\nstudent: have to\nteacher: yes, that's right\nstudent: thank you\nteacher: If an author goes to a publishing house and says, I've got this idea for a book, and the publishing house agrees to publish it, it means the author 'gets a book deal'\nstudent: is it informal?\nteacher: Yes, most English people say I've got for I have\nstudent: gets a book deal - clear!\nteacher: And then the author can't give their book to any other publisher)\nstudent: super )\nteacher: Then we have an adjective 'abundant'. It means a lot of! For example, five tomato plants will give you an abundant harvest\nstudent: harvest?\nstudent: urozhay? )\nteacher: Yes, correct!)\nteacher: and another word for 'harvest' is produce\nteacher: but the stress is on the first syllable\nteacher: prOduce\nstudent: produce as a noun?\nteacher: yes\nstudent: clear!\nteacher: not 'prodUce' like the verb)\nteacher: I love how you say 'clear' because with many students I'm always guessing whether they got it or not :)\nstudent: haha\nstudent: I'm a teacher too\nstudent: So I see )\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: that's it\nteacher: One last! You know the big round lights at a theatre that move from actor to actor?\nstudent: sure\nstudent: softies ))\nteacher: So that one is in the dark but another one is light\nteacher: It's called a spotlight\nteacher: because it only lights one spot\nstudent: spotlights like on instagram?\nstudent: ))\nteacher: and metaphorically, if a spotlight is on some person / country / event, there is a lot of attention given to them at the moment\nteacher: Hmm, I don't know about spotlights on insta!\nteacher: I've got to check it out\nteacher: For example, because of the upcoming election, the spotlight if now on the USA\nstudent: I might be wrong )\nteacher: Olia says in the interview, the spotlight is now on Ukraine. The interview is from 2015, so we know why!\nstudent: sure!\nteacher: And we're out of time!\nstudent: unfortunately!\nstudent: Thank you )\nstudent: I like our chats )\nteacher: I'm going to send you the link to the interview, could you read the first two questions and answers? or the whole thing if you want to, obviously\nteacher: and then we can talk about it next time!\nstudent: ok! )\nteacher: I'll send it to you on Facebook too\nstudent: Thank you!\nteacher: Oh, I really enjoy chatting with you too :)\nteacher: Ok, have a lovely weekend, I'll message you on facebook!\nstudent: bye )\nteacher: bye :)",

I'm providing the material for it and helping analize it initially, but I don't know what's happening. There is a big research team!\nstudent: wow\nteacher: sorry, analyze with a 'y'\nstudent: you don't even know how long you will be going to teach students\nstudent: ?\nteacher: I don't!\nteacher: But we can enjoy it while it lasts :)\nstudent: interesting\nteacher: How are you, Olivia?\nstudent: yeah\nstudent: I am fine\nstudent: but a bit upset\nteacher: oh really? what's wrong?\nstudent: by the way\nstudent: Happy Teacher's Day ( it is going to be this Sunday)!\nteacher: Oh thank you, sweetie!

Not an easy role, is it?\nstudent: so somebody had got to make some decorations\nteacher: for Teacher's Day?\nstudent: and nobody of course was going to do it\nstudent: yep\nstudent: *p\nteacher: and it puts you in a difficult position because you feel as a head girl you're responsible for it?\nstudent: so yesterday I have bought some balloons and paper\nstudent: so today I woke up earlier to make the decorations\nteacher: a lot of extra work for you!\nstudent: I made a title 'happy teacher's day' from the paper\nstudent: yes\nstudent: and my friend also helped me\nteacher: that's nice\nstudent: so during the break we inflated the balloons and taped the letters on\nteacher: ok\nstudent: while we were inflating the balloons, some boys disturbed us\nstudent: I asked them not to do this\nstudent: some of them listened, but one of them maybe doesn't\nstudent: *doesn't like me\nstudent: so he continued doing this because he wanted to drive me mad (that's easy to do)\nteacher: Oh poor Olivia, it doesn't sound good!\nstudent: we finished decorating, but after that during one of the next breaks, everybody was 'having fun' with the balloons\nstudent: I tried to stop them\nteacher: Did the balloons pop?\nstudent: but I had to call our class teacher and I asked her to stop them\nstudent: yes, a big part of them\nstudent: they popped them not accidentally !\nstudent: just to have some fun\nteacher: I see. It was hard work and a lot of preparation for you and your friend and they decided to play with the balloons and destroyed them?\nstudent: and they made some letters fall off ( l and ya)\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Very very upsetting! I can imagine\nstudent: I was very sad and angry\nteacher: I see why!\nstudent: but one boy named Emma Chen swept all popped balloons away\nteacher: Do you have school on Saturdays?\nstudent: and I am really thankful to him\nstudent: no\nteacher: ah, so some people saw that it was hard on you\nstudent: but my friend Sophia made me angry like nobody else\nteacher: Did you still have the Teacher's Day celebration, even if the decorations were damaged?\nstudent: yes\nstudent: I glued the letters back in their places\nstudent: and some balloons were alive\nteacher: what do you mean?\nstudent: by what?\nteacher: the balloons were alive\nteacher: I hope they weren't!))\nstudent: hehe\nstudent: I mean they didn't pop all the balloons, but most of them\nteacher: aah, some of the balloons were ok then)\nstudent: so while we were decorating and one boy wanted to drive me mad, I told him to stop, when my friend Sophia said\nstudent: Relax! '\nstudent: like I was doing something bad\nteacher: ah, you feel like she didn't support you?\nstudent: I felt like I wanted to punch her\nteacher: yes, I can imagine\nstudent: because she is not really a good friend\nteacher: I hope you and her can work it out!\nstudent: and after that I don't want to be friends with her\nstudent: when she told me something and I didn't respond, she said, 'What happened ?'\nstudent: seriously?\nteacher: sounds like a bad miscommunication between you and Sophia!\nstudent: yes\nstudent: do you want to know why I don't really like her as a friend ?\nteacher: why?\nstudent: it happened  in May (quarantine)\nstudent: in the morning, everything was fine\nstudent: in the*\nstudent: we were chatting\nstudent: but at about 12 o'clock\nstudent: when I asked her something\nstudent: she didn't say anything\nstudent: I called her, asking what happened\nstudent: but she didn't respond\nteacher: do you know what was wrong?\nstudent: she blocked me on Instagram and TikTok\nteacher: goodness!\nstudent: so we didn't talk for a long time\nstudent: and in July\nstudent: I asked our friend to ask her what had happened\nstudent: and after that she messaged me on  Instagram with 'hi, maybe let's talk?'\nstudent: I agreed\nteacher: ok, she made an attempt then\nstudent: she said that it was a bad situation (like it was also my fault!)\nstudent: so the reason was\nstudent: she had one thing to do during the quarantine, she was doing some research on the Internet etc.\nstudent: so she didn't have time to talk\nstudent: to me\nstudent: (but we talked every day)\nstudent: so she wasn't even interested in calling me\nteacher: I see, it doesn't sound like a good enough reason for you?\nteacher: and she didn't communicate that she was busy very well, did she?\nstudent: and she said we had some disagreements( but we didn't !)\nstudent: she wasn't really busy, we communicated every day\nteacher: Oh, I see! It's pretty complicated\nstudent: I said, 'why couldn't you just tell me about it?\nstudent: the worst for me was that she didn't even say anything\nstudent: tell without to\nteacher: Yes, a lack of communication is the worst\nteacher: yes, good correction\nstudent: and she said, 'I thought it would be better if I didn't say anything '\nstudent: she didn't want to be friends until September\nstudent: she said, 'Maybe let's have a break until September?'\nstudent: I agreed\nteacher: She might not enjoy chatting online? Some people prefer face-to-face communication\nstudent: and on the first day of school we talked to each other a bit\nstudent: no\nstudent: it wasn't her reason\nstudent: but after that we got on well\nstudent: but today\nteacher: After that you and Sophia got on well you mean?\nstudent: I didn't like her behavior at all\nstudent: yes\nteacher: I see! You wanted her stand up to those boys\nteacher: Do you remember 'stand up to someone'?\nstudent: first, the balloons, second, when I said something jokingly, she looked at me like I was stupid and said something about me to my friend Alexandra\nstudent: yes, I remember\nstudent: by the way, today my Ukrainian teacher was in a good mood\nstudent: so I got a good mark today\nteacher: Does it mean you got a good mark?\nstudent: *d\nteacher: Haha, good! :)\nstudent: hehe\nteacher: Maybe you just got a good mark because you deserved it?\nstudent: maybe\nteacher: :)\nstudent: do you want a funny fact?\nteacher: Go on!\nstudent: on Sunday I have got 2 classes, logical math and programming\nstudent: but my classmate invited me to his birthday\nstudent: so I am going to miss the programming class!\nteacher: they invited you __ their birthday\nstudent: to?\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: but 'on my birthday', as you remember\nteacher: invite to a party etc.\nstudent: but my teacher is going to give me a homework for that)\nstudent: so everything is fine\nteacher: good!\nstudent: there is also a funny story from yesterday\nstudent: because of the teacher's day, we had some cakes for all our teachers\nteacher: lucky teachers!\nstudent: we gave our PE teacher a cake\nstudent: one of the boys in our class asked us, 'Can i eat it?'\nstudent: we jokingly said, 'yes, you can'\nteacher: and did he??\nstudent: he opened it and started to eat it!\nteacher: Oh nooo!\nstudent: I said ' what are you doing?!'\nstudent: he said I thought it wasn't a joke...\nstudent: so he ran to our classroom and brought a new one\nteacher: oh bless)) he must have been hungry!\nstudent: but out teacher said 'no, thank you'\nteacher: That's a lovely story!)))\nstudent: so he ran there the second time\nstudent: and aft\nstudent: er the lesson\nstudent: our teacher gave each of us a piece of this cake)\nstudent: wow\nstudent: I've talked all the lesson\nteacher: It's ok, I like to hear your news!\nstudent: I just like to tell you about my life)\nstudent: hehe\nteacher: And it's quite impressive that you can do it all in English!\nteacher: We'll do some more structured stuff next time\nstudent: yay\nstudent: I think I am going to have some more stories)\nteacher: Speaking of next time, I'm going to take most of next week off to redecorate, so I'm cancelling classes until the week after\nteacher: I have an idea!\nstudent: so what does it mean?\nstudent: what idea?\nteacher: If you have more stories to tell, maybe you can type them before the class, as homework, and then copy the text here\nteacher: If you want to!

Glad to be back at work as I was getting a bit fed up with decorating\nstudent: Is it finished yet?\nteacher: Yes, the walls are finished! I'm pleased about that! But our laminate order is significantly delayed!\nteacher: I'm not pleased about that. Appalling customer service!\nstudent: What do they say?\nteacher: What __ they say?\nstudent: do\nteacher: correct :)\nstudent: )\nstudent: I felt like I missed something important )))\nteacher: Well, they said it's 'because of Covid' but what makes me angry is that they didn't call us to inform us, we called them!\nstudent: ohh, as usual\nstudent: Same story in Ukraine\nteacher: And they also say we can't get a refund, which I'm sure is against the law!\nstudent: If you need something you have to ask about\nteacher: They should have called and said, 'We are very sorry, but there is a delay. Would you like a refund or are you willing to wait?\nteacher: That's what I imagine to be good customer service))\nstudent: The refund for the delay?\nteacher: The refund for the product. Because we have already paid!\nstudent: And now you don't want to wait?\nstudent: Are you going to order laminate from a different company?\nteacher: We're dithering. Do you know 'dither' When you think one thing, then another, then again\nstudent: like hesitate?\nteacher: I quite like the one we ordered. But is it too dark? Maybe not! Maybe yes! But there is a delay! But I like the laminate\nteacher: and so on\nteacher: Yes, exactly like 'hesitate'\nteacher: I'm dithering. I do it a lot))\nstudent: me too\nstudent: And I don't like it\nteacher: It's not pleasant!\nteacher: Well, dither is not exactly like hesitate\nstudent: But you know it's a quality of smart people )))\nteacher: For example, I want to ask someone a question they might not like, but I hesitate (I'm nervous)\nteacher: But 'dithering' means it's hard for me to decide\nteacher: Yes, it is, that's true!\nteacher: Or I can hesitate because I can't remember the right word or am not sure how to pronounce it\nstudent: In Russian I think it's the same\nstudent: I'm not sure\nteacher: But dithering is like, 'soup or sandwich for lunch?' 'soup or sandwich'\nteacher: to be or not to be)))\nstudent: )))\nteacher: Yes, I think it's the same verb in Russian, isn't it?\nstudent: That is the question )\nstudent: Soup or sandwich ))\nteacher: Actually, I wanted to ask you, do you use an English-English dictionary?\nteacher: Exactly))\nteacher: to cancel an order or to wait, in my case\nstudent: I know that dark laminate could be quite\nstudent: hmmm\nstudent: like 'markiy'in Russian )\nteacher: Easily stained? I thought it was white!\nteacher: I'll have to send you the link to the one I'm dithering about))\nstudent: Sure, but dust\nteacher: Ah, I'm with you. You can see the dust easily?\nstudent: Yes! And I mean if the surface is too dark you can see dust easier\nstudent: you can see THE dust?\nteacher: Hmm, I only used 'the' because you mentioned 'dust' in the previous turn\nteacher: but you're right, you can see dust on dark laminate\nteacher: no article\nstudent: hm. It's too hard for me/ I mean articles )\nstudent: Not to see dust )\nteacher: Oh yes, articles are extremely hard for speakers of Russian / Ukrainian because we don't feel the need for them)) We will definitely focus on articles, don't worry!\nstudent: Is your laminate dark dark?\nteacher: Not really!\nteacher: check this out\nstudent: And I know from our designer that you can see scratches on dark laminate easily too\nteacher: oh no, bad link?\nteacher: sorry, this should be better!\nteacher: Something strange is happening to URLs in this programme\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Does it work?\nstudent: unfortunately I can't find the page\nteacher: ah, I'll send it to you in a message later on!\nteacher: I'd like to recommend a really nice online dictionary to you!\nstudent: thank you\nstudent: I'm really interested in it\nteacher: I hope this will work\nstudent: Oh! Thank you\nteacher: Is it working?\nstudent: It works\nteacher: Yay!\nstudent: it's working?\nteacher: Yes, the Cambridge English Dictionary\nteacher: Could you enter one of our recent words, for example 'bill', in the dictionary?\nstudent: sure\nteacher: So, underneath the word, you see which part of speech it is, right? 'noun' in this case\nstudent: done\nstudent: yep\nteacher: Lovely\nstudent: But it's interesting\nteacher: And then you get too versions of pronunciation, the British and the American one\nteacher: What's interesting?)\nstudent: there is no definition referring to law\nstudent: Should I find the area?\nteacher: Oh yes, 'law' is the second meaning, if you scroll down\nstudent: Oh, sorry\nstudent: It's below\nteacher: The first meaning is a bill at a restaurant, or a gas / water bill\nstudent: sure, sorry\nteacher: No worries)) the whole point is to let you see how it works\nstudent: As usual I look very fast\nstudent: And then I miss something important\nstudent: ))\nteacher: No problem!\nteacher: And there is yet another meaning, this one explained with a picture\nteacher: Can you see the picture of a bird?\nstudent: sure\nstudent: so bill is a beak?\nteacher: Yes! But I have a feeling it's more to do with water birds like swans, geese etc.\nstudent: Oh, ok )\nteacher: And then there are lots of expressions, and then you can scroll down even further, and you get 'bill' the verb\nstudent: Oh the part of a cap\nteacher: That too! :))\nstudent: What a wonderful word ))))\nteacher: With nouns, you can also see the letters C / U\nteacher: I know))))\nteacher: For example, a bill is C, but 'milk' or 'love' are U\nteacher: countable / uncountable\nstudent: Ah\nstudent: thank you\nteacher: S for singular\nteacher: and P for plural\nteacher: oh no, sorry, they actually spell it out\nteacher: For example, if you search for 'scissors', it says it's a noun, plural\nstudent: sure\nstudent: Use scissors to cut shapes out )\nteacher: I do love this dictionary, it's so well done with all the pictures, extra expressions etc.\nteacher: Yes!\nstudent: I like it )\nstudent: thank you\nstudent: it seems very helpful\nteacher: And I think an English-English dictionary will be really useful to you\nteacher: And you get the pronunciation!\nteacher: Oh, did you have a chance to read the interview with Olia? Or part of it\nstudent: Oh, Ms. Rodriguez, sorry\nstudent: I forgot about the homework!!!!\nteacher: No worries))) on Friday then, right?\nstudent: Because we hadn't been doing it before, I completely forgot about it!\nstudent: I promise on Friday!\nteacher: No problem, don't feel bad! I'll send you the link again, so that you don't have to search the chat\nstudent: No problem, I'll  find it easily!\nteacher: I had this idea about something for us to practise that might be useful for you in your work\nstudent: What is it? )\nteacher: How about I pretend to be one of your students with lots of admin questions, and we talk and can build up the vocabulary you might need for that\nstudent: I like the idea!\nteacher: Great! Could you in this case tell me what you typical students are like? Do you still get many EFL teachers?\nstudent: I don't think so\nstudent: Usually they're foreigners from different companies which are working here\nteacher: not teachers anymore?\nstudent: Companies like NGO\nstudent: I'm not sure\nstudent: Let me think\nstudent: Now maybe no one\nteacher: Oh wow! Weird!\nstudent: I think teachers are quite busy\nteacher: Ok, I'll be a foreigner from an NGO company))\nteacher: Oh yes, teachers are forever overworked\nstudent: And they are tired of teaching so they don't like to learn\nteacher: they are tired of teaching\nstudent: I mean that they need to learn a lot when they teach\nteacher: tired + of + ing\nstudent: I see\nteacher: oh, I see! yes\nstudent: thank you\nteacher: I was really tired of decorating last week! I'm also tired of this weather (and it's only October)\nstudent: So they are tired of learning and teaching\nteacher: What are you tired of?\nteacher: Yes, they just want ot drink and party, haha\nstudent: I'm tired of dithering )))\nteacher: Ooh, good one!\nteacher: Me too!))\nstudent: Drink and party too\nstudent: You know\nteacher: It's a stereotype of course, I shouldn't have said that!\nstudent: I think that native speaker English teachers here usually have a specific personality\nstudent: hm\nteacher: yes, it's a stereotype for a reason :)\nstudent: like 'oblik' in Russian\nteacher: image?\nstudent: I thought it wasn't right/ I don't know why\nteacher: it depends, do you mean the way other people see them? that's an image\nstudent: So yes ) image )\nteacher: or do you mean 'personality'? what kind of people they are\nstudent: No, maybe I mean their real\nstudent: hm\nstudent: way of thinking\nteacher: mentality!\nstudent: I don't know how to say\nstudent: You know that Ukraine is like an adventure for foreign teachers\nteacher: The Cambridge English dictionary says a 'mentality' is a person's particular way of thinking about things\nstudent: So it's completely logical that they prefer to have adventures and not learn Russian deeply\nteacher: An example from the dictionary: He hopes that closer links between Britain and the rest of Europe will change the British mentality towards foreigners.\nstudent: Sure, mentality! Thank you for the word!\nteacher: Yes, especially since more and more people in Ukraine speak good English, they don't feel the need to learn\nstudent: Maybe\nteacher: Ok, let's try a quick role play, and we can spend more time on it on Friday!\nstudent: so we usually deal with people from organizations like the EU or UN\nstudent: Let's do it!\nteacher: Ah, that's great, I'm with you!\nteacher: Hello, I am writing to find out about Ukrainian classes with your school. I am from Berlin and I am going to work in Kyiv for a month in December. My worry is that I do not speak a word of Ukrainian. Is this something your school can help me with. Thanks, Ms. Rodriguez\nteacher: This is an email you received :)\nstudent: ok )\nstudent: I need to write an answer\nstudent: write\nteacher: Yes, please. You can post one sentence at a time\nteacher: if you want)\nstudent: Hello, we will be happy to help you\nstudent: Unfortunately, now we don't have group classes so we can offer you an individual course with our teacher\nteacher: Ok, great, let's stop here for a second\nstudent: ok!\nteacher: In an official / business email, when you don't really know the person, it's best not to use short forms (don't)\nteacher: short forms = contractions\nstudent: I see!\nteacher: we can offer you __ individual course\nstudent: an\nteacher: yes!))\nstudent: Now we have a quarantine here in Kyiv so now we offer online courses\nteacher: You know what, how about this will be your extra homework? to write an email to reply to this person\nteacher: And then we can look into it on Friday\nstudent: Ok!\nteacher: a quarantine\nstudent: Ah, sure )\nteacher: a quarantine actually has a slightly different meaning\nstudent: So I will read the article and write an email )\nteacher: For example, if a person arrives in the UK, they now have to quarantine (verb)\nstudent: Ah\nteacher: At school, Ethan Smith. brings his homework on Friday, and it's quarantined over the weekend (so that corona dies if there's any on the paper)\nstudent: So do I need another word?\nteacher: or an animal needs to be quarantined\nstudent: same in Russian\nteacher: yes, you can say 'because of Covid restrictions'\nstudent: aha\nstudent: I se\nstudent: I see\nteacher: but it's not used in the same way as a quarantine at school\nstudent: I will 0\\\nteacher: as we say in Russian\nstudent: I see\nteacher: a school is closed / shut because of Covid' for example\nstudent: I see\nteacher: You can find lots of examples in our lovely Cambridge English Dictionary!\nstudent: I will )\nteacher: Right, I've got to let you go! Is an email to an imaginary client + reading an interview enough homework?\nteacher: or too much?))\nteacher: Just do what you have time for!\nstudent: no!\nstudent: I like homework ))))\nteacher: And enjoy your Wednesday off, please give my regards to your mum!\nstudent: Thank you very much!\nstudent: See you!\nteacher: You're very welcome, take care!\nstudent: you too!",
    "teacher: Hello Alexandre!\nstudent: Hi Ms. Jones!\nteacher: Hi - welcome to the chat\nteacher: How are you? And where are you in the world?\nstudent: Thank you! And thank you for letting me improve my English with this study!\nstudent: I am fine, thank you. Just a bit cold, it is getting cold here in Austria.\nstudent: I am Italian, but I moved to Graz last year.\nteacher: Oh Austria, interesting!\nteacher: All the pastry and music :)\nstudent: Yes, it is a nice place to be :) And you? Are you from the UK?\nteacher: I'm from Ukraine, but I've lived in the UK for the last few years\nteacher: Do you speak German as well?\nstudent: Oh, I see...so you also know what it means to leave your country. Even though I suspect you knew the language before reaching the UK.\nstudent: I speak some German, but I am still working on it (the covid lockdown didn't help). I also speak Spanish to a decent level.\nteacher: Yes, I was an English teacher and Cambridge examiner back in Ukraine. And yes, I know about the whole leaving far from home / making a new country your second home\nteacher: Amazing, you're a polyglot!\nteacher: I learned some German at university, but I'm a good few years out of practice and oh so rusty :)\nstudent: Sort of a polyglot...but I enjoy learning languages. Well, you also speak many languages!\nstudent: I believe it is easy to get rusty with German: it is easy to forget the grammar and the genders of nouns\nteacher: I don't really count German among them any more. Oh my, genders and cases basically broke me!\nteacher: Even though there are only three cases in German whereas my native Russian has six and Ukrainian 7. It didn't help!\nstudent: As an Italian I also have trouble with long words...I really believe English to be a lot easier...\nteacher: Do nouns have genders in Italian?\nteacher: Oh yes, German's notorious for its long words, isn't it?\nteacher: Yes, I agree, there is a reason English took over the world\nstudent: Yes, only masculine and feminine...but, unlike with German, there are some simple rules to identify the gender of a noun. That is, you mostly know by reading the last vowel.\nteacher: Yes, very similar to Russian / Ukrainian. Basically, does it end in 'a' :)\nstudent: It is notorious...and, while these words are logical and organised, I don't see the point in having a single word to say 'bread with pumpkin seeds'\nteacher: Haha, I see your point!!\nteacher: But I like that German is a bit like Lego. Once you've learned the most common roots, you can guess the meaning of many words\nstudent: Indeed that is true...and I also find it more 'precise' than Italian. Don't get me wrong: you can be precise with Italian, but in German it is as if the language comes with some rules that force you to be precise.\nteacher: Hmm, that's an interesting observation. Would you say English and German have that in common?\nstudent: While I find English more 'practical' when talking about technical things...both because most technical terms are in English and because it has a somewhat simplified grammar compared to Italian.\nstudent: I would say English is a bit more on the practical side, German on the precision side. But I'd say English is closer to German in this.\nteacher: Interesting, I've got to think about this one!\nteacher: Yes, I suppose as a Germanic language it will be\nteacher: A tiny thing: we don't really use possessive 's with inanimate nouns\nteacher: For example, Alexandre's book vs. the genders of nounds\nteacher: *nouns, sorry\nstudent: Indeed I felt weird when typing 'pumpkin's'..\nteacher: Yes, that's it, you probably know it intuitively!\nteacher: The names of animals count as animate nounds too, e.g. a swan's bill, a squirrel's tail\nteacher: but 'the legs of a table'\nstudent: Unfortunately I like to use language: I have read a lot in English. Thank you!\nteacher: This is not unfortunate, is it? :)\nstudent: but 'bread with seeds of pumpkin' doesn't sound right...\nteacher: Oh, and 's is used with time phrases too, as you probably know. this week's newspaper, a month's salary\nstudent: No, it isn't...but I realise just now how much I know 'intuitively' but I don't really control.\nteacher: No, that's because it's 'pumpkin seeds' :)\nstudent: okay...so a day's work, yes, I know this intuitively\nteacher: That's a sign of someone who is bilingual or a native speaker\nteacher: It's only if you learn the language from textbooks that you know the rules\nstudent: Okay, then I will be extra careful about it ;) Even though my guess would be that many English speakers get it wrong too...\nstudent: I agree with you on learning from the textbooks...the problem is that oftentimes, especially here in Italy, you study the grammar before you really know how to write a proper sentence.\nteacher: Back to the bread, you can just go with 'pumpkin seed bread'\nteacher: German-style, but in three words\nteacher: Yes, that's how I learnt English, grammar first! I feel that it pays off though if you have a chance to practise a lot afterwards\nstudent: Easier to pronounce ;) okay...so in general I would put the adjectives before the noun 'bread', in this case pumpkin seed.\nstudent: Or wholewheat flour bread...okay, I got this!\nteacher: Yes, that would make a compound noun\nteacher: Yes, wholewheat flour bread\nstudent: Well, after high school I studied math and now I work with artificial intelligence: so I always used English for 'practical' reasons, but it has been a while since I opened a grammar book.\nteacher: Or sourdough bread, the lockdown craze in the UK :)\nstudent: haha, yes! I wanted to write 'whole flour bread' but then I stopped fearing that this is the American spelling...\nstudent: would that be wrong?\nteacher: Hmm, let me think.\nteacher: Whole milk vs. (semi-)skimmed milk\nteacher: but wholewheat flour\nteacher: We want to stress here that the flour is made out of whole wheat\nteacher: rather than the idea that the flour is whole\nstudent: I am unsure about what 'flour is whole' would mean...\nteacher: Oh, what I mean is that we use 'wholewheat flour' as opposed to 'whole flour'\nteacher: because, as you say, 'whole flour' does not make sense\nstudent: okay, thank you for the clarification!\nteacher: No worries. You mentioned that you are interested in punctuation in the sign-up form\nteacher: In the following sentence, a punctuation mark could make it much clearer what you mean\nteacher: I wanted to write 'whole flour bread' but then I stopped fearing that this is the US American spelling...\nstudent: Yes, punctuation is one of those things that I have never fully understood. The Oxford comma and so on...\nstudent: Is there a mistake in that last sentence you copy-pasted?\nteacher: Not really, but when I first read it, I thought that you stopped being afraid that this was the American spelling\nteacher: as in 'you were not afraid anymore'\nteacher: If you put a comma after 'stopped', that would make it much clearer in my opinion\nstudent: haha...so a grammatically correct sentence, but with a weird meaning...a comma was missing.\nteacher: I wanted to write... but then I stopped, fearing that this is the American spelling\nteacher: Does it make sense?\nstudent: Indeed! After you wrote about what you understood while reading the sentence I was wondering whether I would put the comma after 'then' or after 'stopped'...\nstudent: Would both options be correct?\nteacher: If you put a comma after then, this would definitely read like you are not afraid that this is American spelling anymore))\nstudent: Yes, indeed...I think this option came to my mind because in Italian there is an expression I would have used in this context i.e., 'poi per\u00f2', which is often followed by the comma.\nteacher: I see! I'm thinking of an example\nteacher: I was afraid to go to the market because of the risk of infection, but then, I stopped fearing, put my face mask on and went\nteacher: Silly example, just ot illustrate the point\nteacher: *to illustrate\nteacher: Mind you, your original sentence was good without the comma too, and this is a confusing thing about the English punctuation: very little of it is obligatory or regulated by clear rules\nstudent: I see your point, but a comma would have made the sentence much less ambiguous...\nteacher: Yes, true!\nteacher: I'd like to recommend an excellent book on the subject. It's called 'Eats, shoots and leaves' by Lynne Truss\nstudent: Thank you for the recommendation! I will definitely take a look at it!\nteacher: It's a really engaging read and explains some of those punctuation nuances really well\nteacher: The title was inspired by a joke about a panda. Do you know this one?\nstudent: No, I don't...\nstudent: ...and I don't see how pandas could come into play with that title, to be honest ;)\nteacher: Well, a panda walks into a cafe, eats a sandwich, then produces a gun, fires two shots in the air and heads towards the exit\nteacher: The waiter asks, 'What was this about?'\nteacher: The panda produces a badly punctuated wildlife manual and shows it to the waiter\nteacher: The entry for 'panda' says, 'Panda. Large black-and-white mammal, native to China. Eats, shoots and leaves.'\nstudent: Haha...this time there was an extra comma! Very nice :)\nteacher: Yes, exactly! The importance of punctuation))\nteacher: So, what kind of AI are you working on?\nstudent: Currently I am working on a few projects...but the main one, which made me realise that my English knowledge is okay but not excellent, is about GEC...that is, you guessed it, Grammatical Error Correction.\nteacher: Interesting! Are there any areas of grammar that you think you would like to improve?\nteacher: Your English is excellent, and I'm nit-picking to find something to help you with, to be honest\nstudent: Well, thank you! I am not sure...as an Italian I realise that my language use is a bit peculiar, for example I tend to use a lot of words with Latin etymology. If you noticed this, maybe I would like to know some more common alternatives...\nstudent: Or there are some sentences which I am not sure if or why they are correct. I guess those could shed some light on some grammatical areas I don't fully control.\nteacher: Oh I see what you are saying (I haven't noticed). It would be wrong not to take advantage of 60% of the English wordstock. If I recall correctly, this is how much the words of Latin origin make up\nstudent: I see, then I will ask you the following:\nstudent: Is the sentence 'There are two teachers in class' wrong? I have found something similar in a grammar book, and they suggested 'There are two teachers in the class' as the correct version.\nstudent: Do they have different meanings, or is it me not seeing what is wrong with the first one?\nteacher: Ah, articles! Yes, you usually need to use 'the' with indications of place\nstudent: What I was wondering is if, in this case, 'class' could also mean 'lesson' and so the first one could be correct...\nteacher: Class' in this sentence is a singular noun, so you need some kind of an article.\nstudent: As in two teachers are teaching the lesson...but maybe it would be a singular noun anyway...\nteacher: I see what you're saying, but class=lesson is also a singular noun and requires an article\nteacher: Yes, that's right!\nteacher: And, just like you said right now, you would be more likely to say 'two teachers are teaching a class'\nstudent: Okay, anyway thank you for clearing that up! I didn't realise there are this many rules connected with 'animate objects' or 'indications of place'.\nteacher: I've got an idea. Maybe you could send me a piece of your writing that you think could be improved prior to the next class? Then we could have a more focussed practice next time, looking at the grammar, style and punctuation\nstudent: Yes, that is definitely an option. Okay! I will sent you two pieces of writing. One written in a speedy manner, one more carefully...\nteacher: Ok, excellent! Would a class at the same time next week suit you?\nstudent: I would prefer it to start at 11:00, but if that is not possible 9:30 will be fine :)\nstudent: (oh, I forgot the 'a.m.' there...)\nteacher: that's ok, please give me a minute to calculate the time difference\nteacher: is it 11 GMT?\nstudent: yes\nstudent: which means 14 here (so I can take the lesson after lunch)\nteacher: Just checking my timetable\nteacher: We should be still on summer time here in the UK, so yes, 11 GMT is good!\nstudent: Okay. Well, let me know if you realise the time changes. Perfect!\nstudent: Thank you for your time! I am looking forward to the next lesson :)\nteacher: No, it should be fine. It just takes me a moment to switch between time zones, with students in different countries\nteacher: My pleasure, have a lovely week, speak to you on Tuesday!\nstudent: You too, bye!\nteacher: Bye Alexandre!",
    "student: hi again\nteacher: Hi Alice Smith! :)\nteacher: All ok with you?\nstudent: yeah\nteacher: It's nearly holiday time, isn't it?\nstudent: yes\nstudent: tomorrow is a day off\nstudent: and holidays will start on the 22 of October\nteacher: Oh yes, I know. It's a combined church holiday and the Day of the Army, right?\nstudent: *off\nstudent: yes\nstudent: the day of the kozaki\nteacher: the day of Cossacks? really?\nteacher: I thought it was to do with the modern army!\nstudent: and the Day of the Defender of Ukraine\nstudent: yes\nstudent: and we must congratulate our boys today\nteacher: Oh no, but they are not the Cossacks :)\nstudent: future defenders of Ukraine\nteacher: I see!\nteacher: a quick memory test: some of the words from the past lessons\nteacher: penultimate (adjective), to expel, to stand up for something / to someone, at ease, up my street, get into something\nteacher: Now, which one means 'to tell a student they can't be in this school anymore'?\nstudent: when we wanted to say something nice to them, I was trying to make everybody calm, but one boy threw his pencilcase at me\nstudent: I don't remember (\nteacher: Whaat? That's awful!\nteacher: Are you in charge of events like this because you are the head girl?\nstudent: I was upset with that, but he said sorry and he said that he wanted to throw it to his friend\nstudent: yes\nstudent: but to be honest it made me cry\nteacher: Oh, that makes it a little better that he said sorry, doesn' tit?\nstudent: yes, it does\nteacher: Oh no, I can imagine!\nstudent: because I am doing everything for our class\nstudent: for them\nstudent: and they don't appreciate it\nteacher: Yes, I see, you are in a very difficult position in this role! Have you talked to your class teacher about it?\nstudent: she saw me crying\nteacher: You can't be expected to discipline everyone and look after them, you are not a grown-up!\nstudent: and my friend Sarah accidentally hit my leg in the PE lesson\nstudent: maybe\nstudent: so today is\nstudent: a bad day\nstudent: *a\nteacher: Oh, school is tough!\nstudent: yeah\nteacher: Is your Mum home when you get back?\nstudent: no\nteacher: Oh, I see, so you can't talk to her until later?\nstudent: yes\nstudent: she is in the salon now\nstudent: I've told my dad about it\nstudent: *t\nteacher: Oh good\nteacher: Ok, Alice Smith, I'm going to give you the words and their meanings, and you try and match them, ok?\nteacher: penultimate (adjective), to expel, to stand up for something / to someone, at ease, up my street, get into something\nstudent: okay\nteacher: 1. to make a student leave school (because of bad behaviour, for example)\nstudent: to expel\nteacher: Yes, correct!\nteacher: For example, this boy was _____ from school for bad behaviour\nstudent: expelled\nteacher: Yes, well done!\nteacher: Does your school ever expel students?\nstudent: maybe\nstudent: my school wanted to expel one boy from another class\nteacher: It was from our HP words. HP nearly got expelled from Hogwarts several times :)\nteacher: and what happened?\nstudent: he is still in our school\nteacher: ah, ok :)\nteacher: he is still __ our school\nstudent: but now they want to expel one of my classmates\nteacher: Do you think they should expel your classmate? Or do you think they should fight for them / support them to do better?\nstudent: he is that friend who my classmate threw a pencilcase to\nteacher: I see, so he must get into trouble a lot!\nstudent: well, his behavior is really bad, but he is a bit nice as a person\nstudent: he invited me to his birthday last week\nteacher: That's sweet!\nteacher: Ok, next word! the last but one =\nstudent: penultimate\nteacher: well done!\nteacher: For example, y is the penultimate letter of the alphabet\nteacher: next one: to defend an idea / a person who is being attacked / criticized\nstudent: stand up for\nteacher: stand __ for\nstudent: up\nteacher: yes, correct!\nteacher: For example, some teachers wanted to expel this boy, but others stood up for him\nteacher: because he was a nice person deep down\nteacher: or something like that\nteacher: Ok, if you're feeling nice and relaxed, you're feeling ___ ___\nstudent: at ease\nteacher: yes, correct!\nteacher: What helps you feel at ease when you have a new teacher or a new class, like your drama class?\nstudent: hugging my big toys\nteacher: Aww, your cuddly toys?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Ok!\nteacher: and if you are starting to enjoy something and are doing more and more of it, you ___ ____ something\nstudent: get into something\nteacher: Yes! Are you getting into acting and drama then?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Ok, can you give me a full sentence, please?\nstudent: last week we made a congratulatory video in the acting class\nteacher: Ok, how do you mean?\nstudent: and my PE teacher today said that she saw me in this video, 'was it you?'\nteacher: Did you upload it to Youtube or something?\nstudent: it was Teacher's day\nstudent: to facebook\nteacher: Oh I see! So you are getting into it then!\nteacher: Ok, one last! if something is the type of thing that you like / are interested in, it is __ ___ ___\nstudent: up my street\nteacher: Yes, sure!\nteacher: Ok, a quick practice. Let's use these words and phrases to ask each other questions (and answer them)\nteacher: I'll start\nteacher: What was your penultimate lesson at school today?\nstudent: it was PE\nteacher: Of course it was, like the previous Tuesday, I remember now!\nteacher: Ok, your turn\nstudent: have you ever got into something ?\nteacher: Definitely, so many things! I think the latest thing I got into is gardening\nstudent: oh yes\nstudent: I remember that)\nteacher: But I've told you all about that))\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Are animated films up your street?\nstudent: yes, they are\nteacher: Which one is your favourite?\nstudent: not easy to say\nteacher: I like animations for kids, but not for adults. My favourite is Finding Dori))\nstudent: oh yeah\nstudent: it is nice!\nstudent: what is wrong with animations for the adults?\nteacher: Two more ways to say something is exactly what you like: my cup of tea, my jam\nteacher: Don't know, I just prefer actors!\nteacher: Nothing's wrong, they can be really talented\nteacher: They are just not my cup of tea :)))\nstudent: yeah\nteacher: Have you heard this one? 'my cup of tea' / 'not my cup of tea'?\nstudent: nope\nteacher: #ERROR!\nteacher: All fun ways to say the same thing)\nteacher: Ok, Alice Smith, thanks for today, I've got to let you go! Hope you'll feel better soon and have a nice relaxing day tomorrow!\nstudent: thank you too!\nstudent: bye!\nteacher: Take care!",
    "student: I'm here\nteacher: Hi Emily Smith! :)\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: Hello Sarah Thompson!\nstudent: I'm fine thank you!\nstudent: How are you?\nteacher: All good, thanks!\nstudent: How's the redecoration?\nteacher: Did you have a nice day off yesterday?\nteacher: Ooh, I've done the walls, they are now this really bright warm colour, I'm very pleased, thanks :)\nstudent: Yes, I did. Spent some quality time with my family and my mom\nstudent: Which colour did you choose?\nteacher: Well, it's like an off red. Red with orange and pink tones\nstudent: Sounds nice!\nteacher: Kind of like a terracotta red, but not as brown\nstudent: Is it one room?\nstudent: Got it\nteacher: Yes, the dining room\nstudent: Cool\nteacher: We bought this place 3 years ago but didn't have much chance to re-decorate, and the previous owners were very much into their neutrals))\nstudent: Terracotta red boosts appetite!\nteacher: And I've definitely had enough of neutrals in 3 years!\nteacher: Ha, yes! Not that it needs any boosting)))\nstudent: I heard neutrals are very in right now\nteacher: In right?\nteacher: in vogue?\nteacher: or just 'in'\nstudent: to be in\nteacher: as in 'fashionable', right?\nstudent: I thought they say it like that )\nstudent: yes\nstudent: trendy\nteacher: Hmm, I've never heard it.\nteacher: yes, trendy!\nteacher: I've read that every year there is a global crisis, grey becomes the top colour for interiors\nteacher: It happened in 2008 and again in 2020\nteacher: I fail to see the logic of it though\nstudent: Yes! I've read the same thing\nstudent: Every time there's a crisis, people start wearing very basic neutral clothes\nteacher: Isn't it weird? Everything is terrible, so we need to paint the walls... grey!\nstudent: hahahah\nstudent: weird!\nstudent: I have always been a fan of colour\nteacher: Ah, it's the same trend in clothes then\nteacher: Me too!\nteacher: I've been thinking some more about the translation of 'podvig' we were talking about last time\nstudent: Oh yes. What did you come up with?\nteacher: Sacrifice\nteacher: Check this out\nteacher: On this day in 1940, the sacrifice of RAF pilots in the Battle of Britain was never more evident. In heavy fighting over the Channel ports of Dover, Weymouth and Portland, Fighter Command lost 32 aircraft and 25 airmen, the highest number of deaths on any one day during the entire Battle of Britain.\nstudent: Very close indeed.\nteacher: Yes, I think if it was written in Russian, it would be 'podvig'. But it obviously stresses the cost rather than the deed\nteacher: And in case of Heracles / Hercules, it's actually 'labours'\nteacher: The 12 labours of Heracles\nstudent: Although there's something truly Soviet about the word 'podvig' that even this translation does not convey\nteacher: Exactly, I agree))\nstudent: still very close\nteacher: a marked difference in perception\nstudent: Meanwhile, I'm trying to google the phrase 'to be in' and can't seem to find it\nstudent: I'm trying\nteacher: Ah, I'll have a look in a minute\nteacher: It's something like 'pumpkin lattes are very in at the moment'\nstudent: Yes!\nstudent: I heard it many times\nstudent: maybe they just omit the word 'style' or 'fashion'\nteacher: Yes, basically!\nstudent: colloquially\nteacher: exactly\nstudent: I see\nstudent: thanks\nteacher: I'll find it for you a bit later\nteacher: Oh, and we were talking about nasal congestion last time :)\nteacher: And I thought later on, it's actually a 'stuffy' nose, not 'stuffed'))\nstudent: stuffed sounds good too)))\nteacher: Because it's not actually stuffed with anything, thankfully, like a stuffed animal or stuffed bell peppers))\nstudent: I'll make a mental note\nstudent: thank you\nteacher: And 'sniffles' can also be 'snuffles'. I know, not confusing at all!\nteacher: What's Sophia up to these days?\nstudent: Sophia has been very active lately\nstudent: She's in awe of mechanisms and transport\nteacher: Oh wonderful! Ethan Walker was too at this age\nteacher: in awe ___  mechanisms\nstudent: You know what her favourite toy is right now\nteacher: What?\nstudent: thanks\nstudent: Try to guess\nteacher: a car?\nteacher: a washing machine?\nstudent: bigger\nstudent: than a car\nteacher: hmmm\nteacher: a digger?\nstudent: a means of transport\nteacher: the metro??\nstudent: sorry, I'm not even sure you can call it transport\nteacher: Hmm, I give up!\nstudent: the machine that is involved in construction\nstudent: construction\nteacher: I know! a crane?\nstudent: she sees these machines from the window every day\nstudent: passing by\nstudent: a crane is a good guess but no\nteacher: excavators?\nstudent: almost\nteacher: Cement mixers?\nstudent: what's the English for the truck that delive\nstudent: YAY\nstudent: thank you\nstudent: now I know what it's called\nteacher: yep)) they are very cool!\nteacher: now I know __ it's called (what goes in the gap?)\nstudent: what\nteacher: yep)) hard to unlearn this one, isn't it)\nstudent: Russian interference)))\nteacher: Definitely!\nteacher: the interference\nstudent: exactly\nteacher: Ooh, in this case I've got a recommendation for you and Sophia))\nstudent: And what is Ethan's favourite toy at the moment?\nteacher: Truck Tunes on Youtube! They are songs and videos about construction (and not only) vehicles\nstudent: A recommendation! Yes please\nstudent: Cool!\nteacher: They are actually good tunes, very catchy\nteacher: Ethan adored them\nteacher: Very American English\nstudent: We'll check them out\nteacher: This is where I learned the names of many trucks from))\nstudent: perfect!\nteacher: Ethan's now into a whole number of things! Dinosaurs, Star Wars, Lego, ninjas (!), the dragons from How to Train Your Dragon and animals\nstudent: I'll send you the link and you'll tell me if this is the correct video later\nteacher: Oh, I finally found something with 'in'. The in thing! as in something that's fashionable at the moment\nteacher: Yes, of course\nstudent: ninjas!\nstudent: thank you! your googling skills are superb!\nteacher: haha, thanks\nteacher: Just thinking of an example\nteacher: What's the in thing in Kyiv now?\nstudent: Does Ethan love Star Wars as much as his dad?)))\nteacher: Haha, you remember that))) nearly as much!\nteacher: I can't even think of an thing because everyone just stays at home\nstudent: Collapsed infrastructure is very in these days.. in Kyiv\nstudent: A collapsed?\nteacher: Maybe home baking is the in thing in 2020\nteacher: collapsed infrastructure? Do you mean the places that went broke?\nstudent: Oh yes. Even I started baking.\nstudent: the roads, the pipes...\nteacher: collapsed infrastructure' sounds right, but I don't think it collocates with the in thing, unless you're being sarcastic\nteacher: which I think you are\nstudent: It was a joke. Now let me make a proper example\nteacher: Ok))\nstudent: Street food, matcha lattes and e-cigarretes are very in right now\nteacher: Ah, Kyiv is so cool! I really miss it!\nteacher: What's the street food like there now?\nstudent: Think about the infrastructure and you'll miss it a little bit less )))\nstudent: The street food is really nice. Tacos and hotdogs.\nstudent: I remembered one more thing\nteacher: I know what you mean. Our water supply has been really spotty the last few days! Burst pipes\nstudent: e-scooters are very in\nteacher: Tacos!! Yum!!\nstudent: The last few days you were in Kyiv?\nteacher: I have this theory that Mexico is the American Ukraine\nstudent: hahahaha! I love the theory\nteacher: both in terms of problems (not the same) and the amazing food\nstudent: yes. The comparison is spot-on\nteacher: Well, what I'm trying to say is that, even though the problems are not the same, they still make them both quite poor countries\nteacher: But the festival spirit and food are there!\nteacher: Noo, the water supply here in England!\nteacher: E-scooters! They are a very green way to get about, aren't they? But aren't they creating a problem for pedestrians?\nteacher: I also can't imagine e-scooters in Kyiv in the winter!\nstudent: Can best be described with O.Oles poem.. Remember the one that starts: \u0437 \u0436\u0443\u0440\u0431\u043e\u044e \u0440\u0430\u0434\u0456\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043e\u0431\u043d\u044f\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c\nteacher: Yes, spot-on!\nstudent: By the way, what happens if there are 2 s in the end of the name (one of which is possessive)\nstudent: Oles's\nstudent: Oles'\nstudent: slipped my mind\nstudent: this grammar rule\nteacher: It's a tricky one. I think actually it's the first one\nteacher: A quick google says it's both, actually!\nstudent: Kyiv is not e-scooter friendly at all. Nevertheless, people are crazy about them right now and rent them like taxis and ride all over the city\nteacher: But English people are not sure of that one either\nteacher: I have a friend, her little girl is called Tess\nteacher: Tess's' looks a bit awkward\nteacher: But you can go for 'Tess'' and still add /iz/ in pronunciation\nstudent: three s in a row! wow!\nstudent: got it. thanks\nteacher: Wow! Interesting!! Central Kyiv is also so hilly, I'd be afraid to scoot around\nteacher: But that's just me, I'm a wuss when it comes to hills and bikes / scooters\nstudent: You know, the only place where this is fun is in the middle of Lesya Ukrainka bvld\nteacher: Yes, wide and flat!\nstudent: And no pedestrians)\nstudent: I tried it a couple of times and concluded that it is not safe\nstudent: Can I say 'concluded' here?\nteacher: I wish I had had an e-scooter when I worked just off Lesya Ukrainka bvld, it was a terribly long walk from the metro station\nteacher: Yes, of course, that's right\nteacher: Concluded or came to a conclusion\nstudent: Did you use to walk up the bvld?\nstudent: or down\nstudent: That's it. Thank you\nstudent: In any way, it's tiresome\nstudent: and loooong\nteacher: Well, there were two ways to get to work, one from Pechersk and another one... hmm\nstudent: Klovska?\nteacher: I can't remember!\nteacher: Not Klovska\nteacher: Hmmm\nstudent: Or maybe Palats\nstudent: Sportu\nteacher: Yes! That's right!!\nteacher: Palats Sportu))\nstudent: Andrew calls it Palats Spirtu\nteacher: Tiresome is the word! Urgh, don't miss it!\nteacher: Haha, yes!\nstudent: plenty of homeless drunkards\nstudent: around the entrance\nteacher: Unfortunately\nteacher: And a Murakami\nstudent: murakami right - a cherry on top))))\nteacher: Haha, yes!\nstudent: Time's almost up\nstudent: I have to go and finish cooking soup\nteacher: Yes, I'll let you go. Shall we do Wednesday next week?\nstudent: Perfect!\nstudent: Looking forward to it\nteacher: What time suits you?\nstudent: 0.5416666666666666\nstudent: If that's OK with you\nteacher: Yes, sure, no problem!\nstudent: Thank you for everything, Sarah Thompson!\nteacher: Thank you, have a lovely day!\nstudent: Have a great day!\nteacher: You're very welcome :)\nstudent: Thank you\nteacher: Bye :)\nstudent: Bye!",
    "student: Hello, I see you are here.\nstudent: Hello,  Mr. Johnson\nteacher: Hello Elena Smith - welcome to the project :)\nstudent: Then, let\u2019s get started.\nteacher: How are you? And where are you in China?\nstudent: I'm fine. I'm in Beijing China\nstudent: OK\nteacher: So sorry, my technology's letting me down today!\nteacher: It'll be ok in a minute\nstudent: It's ok\nteacher: Hopefully\nstudent: I will wait for you\nteacher: Thank you\nteacher: I lived in China for a year - in Shanghai\nstudent: Please let me know if you are ready\nteacher: It was a fantastic experience!\nteacher: It seems to be working now, feel free to type\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: And now I live in the UK and am an English teacher. What do you do?\nstudent: I'm an engineer.\nstudent: Focus on machine learning\nteacher: Ah, interesting!\nteacher: Do you use English at work?\nstudent: No. But I often read papers in English.\nstudent: We do not talk in English at work\nteacher: Ok, I see!\nstudent: So what's your project?\nteacher: So what's your aim with improving your English? To understand more when you read / to write / to speak? All of the above?\nstudent: I think it's spoken English.\nteacher: This research project is all about understanding how teaching English works, so that it can be taught to artificial intelligence\nteacher: As far as I understand\nteacher: To be honest, I annotate and generate some of the data for the project, but I know little about what happens afterwards\nstudent: Ok. Actually I'm also doing a project for AI, like a chatbot\nteacher: Yes, the aim is to create a charbot as far as I understand\nstudent: It should be a QA chatbot using AL algorithms.\nteacher: What are AL algorithms, please?\nstudent: Haha, It's interesting. I will pay attention to your project\nstudent: Sorry. It's AI algorithms\nteacher: Thank you. Like I say, I know very little about the end product!\nteacher: Ah, got you, no problem\nstudent: I will join in a lab to do a research on AI in bioinformatics\nstudent: And my supervisor speaks English.\nteacher: Elena Smith, I have to ask, I'm not very good at identifying whether a Chinese name is male or female, could you tell me your gender please? If you're having the same problem with my name, I'm a woman :)\nstudent: Male\nteacher: Thank you\nteacher: my supervisor speak Englis' Can you spot a mistake?\nteacher: A grammatical one\nteacher: *English, sorry\nstudent: My supervisor speaks English. Right?\nteacher: Yes, correct!\nteacher: I'm just trying to identify some areas we could work on, don't worry about it\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: So what kind of Q&amp;A is your chatbot going to do?\nteacher: It's QA as in questions and answers, right? Or not?\nstudent: I collect some conversations from the forum\nstudent: yes, questions and answers\nstudent: But it's just for technical questions\nteacher: I see! What are the conversations about?\nteacher: Oh, I see!\nstudent: Because my coversations come from an Ubuntu system forum.\nteacher: I see! I once had a laptop on Ubuntu, a while ago\nstudent: I know you are an English teacher. So, do you have any good advice on learning spoken English.\nteacher: Well, your written English is pretty good. What kind of problems do you experience when you speak?\nstudent: Thanks. I often make mistakes with something like: do doing done\nstudent: Because Chinese does not have these types of words.\nteacher: The tenses? I do vs. I'm doing?\nstudent: yes, tenses\nteacher: Yes, I know that tenses are expressed very differently in Chinese\nstudent: When I talk, I must think a while about these things\nteacher: Ok, now I'm getting a slightly better idea\nteacher: We can definitely look at some tenses!\nteacher: Is Present Simple and Present Continuous something you know about?\nteacher: I know English is taught very differently in different countries\nstudent: Yes. I've learned them. I know the concepts\nteacher: Ok, you me mentioned your AI project\nteacher: It's something you're working on this month / year\nteacher: Right?\nteacher: So Present Continuous would be good here\nteacher: I'm working on a Q&amp;A chatbot'\nteacher: Better than 'I work'\nteacher: Sorry, this is Mr. Johnson\nteacher: I switched from my phone to my laptop\nteacher: My laptop decided it needed to configure Windows just before our class! So frustrating. But it's done now\nstudent: It's ok\nteacher: Does this make sense? 'I work in the sphere of machine learning' (all the time, it's your profession - Present Simple) vs. 'I'm working on a chatbot now' (a temporary project - Present Continuous)\nstudent: I don\u2019t know what's the difference. I work or I'm working, maybe they are the same thing?\nteacher: Not exactly!\nteacher: For example, I'm an English teacher. I teach English - Present Simple\nteacher: Now, I'm working in this research project\nteacher: But I didn't before and I probably won't be forever!\nteacher: it's a continuous temporary situation\nstudent: I think this is about the 'time'.\nteacher: Well, the time is present in both cases\nteacher: But continuous tenses stress the process, not something that is always the case\nteacher: For example, I read a lot of books. Now, I'm reading book 'X'\nteacher: I read a lot of books. - it's always the case, it's a fact about me\nteacher: I'm reading book X - just now, I'm in the process of reading book 'X'\nstudent: Ok. I got it.\nteacher: Ok! I'm going to ask you some questions, to practise this\nteacher: Do you like reading books?\nstudent: continuous tense?\nteacher: No, this is actually Present Simple. Do you like books? or maybe video games? or TV?\nstudent: Present Simple\nteacher: That's right\nteacher: What's your answer? :)\nstudent: Present Simple\nteacher: Yes, correct. I mean, could you answer the question about books? Do you, Elena Smith, like books?\nstudent: Yes\nstudent: I like reading books\nteacher: Ok, cool! Thanks for the full answer\nteacher: Are you reading a book now? Not right this second, but maybe this week or this month?\nstudent: Yes. Its title is Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning.\nstudent: Its\nteacher: Ok, perfect. So you could say, 'I__ ____ Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning now'\nteacher: Good correction, 'its'\nstudent: am reading\nteacher: Yes, perfect\nteacher: Is this something that you already know and is easy for you? Or is it new / interesting? I mean Present Simple vs. Present Continuous\nstudent: When I was at school I learnt it, now I know it again.\nteacher: Ok, cool\nteacher: Is the Golden Week over in China now?\nstudent: Yes. it is already over.\nteacher: Did you have a good holiday?\nstudent: yes, I did\nteacher: Ok, can you tell me a bit about it?\nstudent: The () is not so serious in China now, so I went out last week.\nstudent: pandemic? I don\u2019t know how to spell it\nteacher: Right, that's good! Well done China! It's back here, badly\nteacher: the pandemic, correct!\nstudent: Sorry about it.\nteacher: I remember the Golden Week in Shanghai. Beautiful! My son was born just before it\nteacher: Thank you. There is a partial lockdown\nstudent: Wow. You've been to China before?\nteacher: I mean there is a lockdown in some areas of the UK but not others\nstudent: Yes. I know the situation.\nteacher: Yes! Did I not mention it? Sorry, it's jumping between my phone and my silly laptop again!\nteacher: I spent a year in Shanghai, my son was born there!\nstudent: Great! Shanghai is a famous city in China.\nstudent: I will move to Shanghai next year.\nteacher: I love it! I'm really nostalgic about it\nteacher: Really? Exciting!\nteacher: Have you been there before?\nstudent: Yes. I went there to see my friends before.\nstudent: And next year I will join a lab in Fudan Univesity, as a PHD\nteacher: Lovely. Hopefully, we can talk some more about it next time. Do you think these lessons are useful for you? Would you like to continue? We can focus on tenses in the future\nteacher: Oh, good! I bet you're excited abou it!\nteacher: *about\nstudent: Yes. of course.\nteacher: Ok, great. Would the same time next week suit you?\nstudent: It depends on you. My time is ok in this slots\nteacher: Yes, mine too\nstudent: SO, we can talk next week?\nteacher: Great, in this case I'll pop some homework on Present Simple vs Present Continuous in an email for you, if you have time for it\nteacher: Yes, absolutely, same time next week\nstudent: Thanks a lot.\nteacher: Lovely, thank you. Take care!\nstudent: OK. See you next week!\nteacher: See you!\nteacher: You can just leave the chatroom, everything is saved automatically",
    "teacher: Hi Sophia Smith!\nstudent: Hi Mrs. Smith! How are you?\nstudent: Sorry about writing you before, but I didn't write down the exact time anywhere so I was unsure...\nteacher: All good, thank you. Thanks for accommodating the change in time and sorry about the confusion!\nteacher: No problem!\nstudent: Great, so where do we start today?\nteacher: Is Austria switching to winter saving time this weekend?\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: Ok, that's good then, the UK is as well\nstudent: Great, so the time difference will remain the same.\nteacher: Before we proceed I'll just mention that I'll be on holiday next week, so I can't offer you a class until the beginning of November\nteacher: It's half-term time!\nstudent: That is fine...I don't really know the term dates since I work now...but okay! How long will this experiment go on for?\nteacher: I'm not sure actually! I know the researchers need loads of data for now, but I'm not sure what the timeframe is\nteacher: My son's started school this year, it'll be his first school holiday :)\nteacher: There is no pressure for you to continue as you probably know!\nstudent: Ha, that's nice :) Then enjoy your holidays...even though I guess this will be a complicated year to start school.\nteacher: It's been going well so far! They treat every class as a 'bubble', the idea is that classes and teachers don't mix\nstudent: Oh, as long as I can manage I am happy to take some English lessons...I was just wondering if this was likely to go on for a few months.\nteacher: But of course, this is torpedoed by the fact that children have siblings in other years at school\nteacher: We're constantly on amber alert, so to say. If any child tests positive for covid, they will shut the class / school for two weeks\nstudent: Of course...and, from what I can remember, it is difficult to completely isolate small children...\nteacher: Yes, social distancing for primary school is not really feasible\nteacher: I take comfort from the fact that ours is a small school and a small town! I would be more worried if we lived in Cambridge, for example\nstudent: I agree...well, hopefully this won't last much longer.\nteacher: Yes, hopefully 6 more months or so... who knows!\nstudent: Yes, that is also a factor...I am also happy to live in a small town near Graz: the less people around, the less likely the spread...but still, our life changed quite a lot!\nstudent: Yes, hopefully 6 months or so and we will be back to something resembling normality\nteacher: Exactly!\nteacher: We're in a tiny town that is a 30-minute train ride away from Cambridge\nteacher: Thanks for your email, it was really useful! I've prepared a few things we could talk about based on it\nstudent: Then it must be in the countryside! Here we have some fields too, but it is more like a 10-minute train ride to Graz.\nstudent: Perfect! I was wondering if all that could help...unfortunately it is difficult to tell what you don't know (especially when you are not studying following a syllabus or something).\nteacher: It's basically the countryside, yes. Well, by English standards it's a town and not a village, and we're very proud of this fact :))\nteacher: But it's surrounded by fields and farms. Cambridgeshire and the rest of East Anglia are the bread basket of the UK as they say\nteacher: It's really flat and the soil is very fertile\nstudent: haha, I see :) well, I think a small town is great for children: it is usually quiet and green but, at the same time, it has some basic facilities and places to go.\nteacher: Exactly! We've even got a swimming pool :)\nstudent: I don't think I can grasp the meaning of 'flat' for an Englishman: I have always lived in between mountains...\nteacher: I was born in a beautiful mountainous place - Crimea\nteacher: But here is unbelievably flat\nteacher: Which is great for cycling\nteacher: The only 'hill' in our town is a railway bridge\nstudent: Indeed...less so if you want to go hiking.\nteacher: This area used to be fens. Do you know a 'fen'?\nstudent: I think it is a wooden or metal structure made up of poles and a net or wooden plates...used to separate fields or different properties.\nstudent: And I remember Tom Sawyer managed to make his friends pay to paint one...am I right?\nteacher: Hmmm\nteacher: oh, I'm with you!\nteacher: That's a 'fence'\nstudent: now I see..:I got it all wrong\nstudent: then I don't know\nteacher: Yes, Tom Sawyer :)\nteacher: A fen is a kind of a swamp or a marsh\nteacher: an area of land that is part swamp\nteacher: So all this around here used to be fens, but they were drained in the 19th century (I believe)\nteacher: to build town and cities\nstudent: yes, now I see...I am still trying to understand how I mixed it up with 'fence'...but I was so sure!\nteacher: No worries! 'fence' does make sense in my original sentence\nstudent: I see...they drained a lot of fens in Italy too...\nteacher: Oh really? I didn't know that!\nstudent: Indeed it doesn't make sense...but for some reason I imagined a countryside full of small fences cutting the land in small portions...\nteacher: If the sea level rises significantly, all this area will be underwater again\nteacher: No, that makes sense!\nstudent: Yes, for example Latina (near Rome) was drained between the two wars...and in the late 19th century they drained some areas in Veneto...in the Venice area.\nteacher: Oh, of course! Venice! I should have thought! Where are you from in Italy?\nstudent: Originally from Friuli...north-east of Venice\nteacher: I see. We were meaning to go to Italy this summer, but alas!\nstudent: Just under Austria, west of Slovenia...there are some nice cities, e.g. Palmanova and Trieste, but we are not in the 'top places in Italy to visit'.\nstudent: Alas...another time I guess...\nteacher: Definitely! Apparently, there is going to be a high-speed train from Lyon\nteacher: to Rome (??) I'm not sure, but I'm looking forward to it!\nstudent: Anyway, if you ever visit Friuli you should definitely eat 'frico', it is a cheese speciality they prepare here. But I would suggest you do that on a cold day.\nteacher: I've just looked it up, and it does look delicious!\nstudent: Yes, there should be a train line...I know they wanted to expand it, but there have always been protests so I don't know at which point they are.\nstudent: Rather than 'here' I should say 'there'...I don't live in Friuli anymore.\nteacher: What are the protests about? Would the construction threaten wildlife preservation areas?\nteacher: Oh my, I've just googled some photos of Friuli - breathtaking!\nteacher: And it does remind me of Crimea :)\nstudent: Yes and no...on the one hand the train would cut through the mountains and people from the valleys do not like that...on the other, some people say it costs too much...\nstudent: I have never been to Crimea...I know little of geo-politics, but I know that the situation there is a bit complicated...\nteacher: To put it mildly, yes\nstudent: Is this one of the reasons why you left the country?\nteacher: To contrast two ideas, English uses 'on the one hand' and 'on the other hand'\nteacher: I'm sure you've heard that\nteacher: On the one hand, the train would cut through the mountains...\nstudent: Oh...I am sure I've made the 'on one side/other side' mistake a lot of times! Thank you for pointing it out!\nteacher: Well, by the time Crimea was annexed by Russia I had been living in Kyiv for several years\nstudent: Yes indeed...this comes from my Italian, so I will write it down to remember that in English it is 'one hand/other hand'\nteacher: The reason I left was falling for a dashing Englishman, haha))\nstudent: Haha, I see...\nteacher: Who became my husband\nteacher: Then we went to live in Shanghai and then finally ended up here in Cambridgeshire\nstudent: Wow! That sounds like a long journey to get to Cambridgeshire!\nteacher: Definitely!\nstudent: It reminds me a bit of my mother: she had almost never left Friuli until she met my dad who brought her to Sicily and then to South America...before coming back to Friuli.\nteacher: Ok, a couple of things from the texts you kindly sent me!\nteacher: South America! Amazing! Which country!\nteacher: ?\nstudent: Paraguay..my dad is a doctor and went there to work for an NGO...that is also why, as child, I learned Spanish.\nstudent: But then I forgot it, and learned it again at university.\nteacher: Ah, that makes sense! Were you born in Paraguay?\nstudent: No...actually it is a bit funny: when my mother was pregnant with me they were in Sicily and my dad decided to send her back to Friuli, because the healthcare there was poor.\nstudent: Then, with my brother, they decided that babies are born everywhere in the world, so he was born in Paraguay.\nteacher: Haha, I see. My son was born in Shanghai\nstudent: haha...I am sure that everyone will ask him 'why?'...at least, this is what happens with my brother.\nteacher: Oh yes, we've set him up for a lifetime of questions! At least he hasn't got a weird name. I always feel people with weird names or weird spellings of common names are destined to explain their names for the rest of their lives\nstudent: Indeed...a friend of mine risked being named 'Macggiver', because his father liked the tv series...and didn't know English.\nteacher: Sophia Smith, would you say you choose to speak British English or American?\nteacher: Oh my, they got away with it though?\nstudent: I try to speak British English but, truth be told, since university I have been exposed to a lot more American English, so I probably mix them up a bit.\nteacher: I see, that makes sense!\nteacher: You use 'write you' a lot, I'm not sure if you know it's a US version\nstudent: In the end his parents decided to name him 'Michael', with a wrong spelling though...\nteacher: as opposed to 'write to you' in English\nstudent: Oh, I didn't know that!\nteacher: I am sorry for taking this long in writing you some English text.\nteacher: This is from your email\nstudent: I am sorry for taking this long to write some English text for you.\nstudent: That would be a British version?\nteacher: I'm for taking this long to write to you.\nteacher: But with 'some English text' I would go with 'to write some English text for you'\nstudent: Indeed...I was just writing that 'taking long in writing' doesn't sound nice.\nteacher: because you're doing it for me / for a class\nteacher: to' goes better with things like 'letter' or 'email'\nteacher: Does it make sense?\nteacher: For example, a songwriter writes lyrics for a singer\nteacher: But: a songwriter writes an email to a singer\nstudent: Yes, I see...\nteacher: I wrote an exercise for you\nteacher: (I didn't, just an example)\nstudent: haha, I see\nteacher: But 'I wrote you a note'\nstudent: I wrote a letter to you.\nstudent: But I probably would use. I wrote you a letter.\nteacher: Yes! 'I wrote you a letter' is fine too\nteacher: But things like 'She hasn't written me recently' are definitely American\nteacher: vs. She hasn't written to me recently, UK\nstudent: Okay, I see. I never realized this difference.\nteacher: I'll be very honest, I thought it was a mistake when I read it, then I looked it up and realized it was an American version\nteacher: But I'm mainly exposed to British English save for TV shows and films\nteacher: or shall I say 'movies' :)\nstudent: Haha...the words 'movies' reminds me of school...but I'd say I use it more often than 'films' (even though, in Italian, we use the word 'film' for this)\nteacher: Of course, that makes sense!\nteacher: I had initially planned to write you something just for the grammar's sake\nstudent: And thank you for telling me: this sort of mistake is quite subtle...\nteacher: Could you correct the problem in this sentence based on what we talked about in the previous lesson?\nstudent: I had initially planned to write you something just for the sake of grammar\nteacher: Yes, correct!))\nstudent: the s goes for animate nouns such as animals and people.\nteacher: absolutely\nstudent: But I will tell you that Italian tends to use 'of' a lot, because there is no equivalent to Saxon genitive in Italian...\nteacher: Interesting! I didn't know that! So you're almost overcompensating :)\nstudent: so, for me, it is easier to remember I don't have to use it...\nteacher: Exactly!\nteacher: Ah, time goes so fast in this chat! We'll have a look at the rest of it next time then\nstudent: wow that is true!\nteacher: Just opening my calendar now\nteacher: How does Tuesday November 3 sound?\nstudent: Same time? Meaning 1 pm for me, 10 am for you?\nstudent: It is okay for me. But I will write it down this time!\nteacher: 1 pm for me, 12 pm for me :) only an hour's difference\nteacher: Yes, it suits me too!\nteacher: Lovely, I'll jot it down in my diary too\nstudent: Okay, perfect. Then enjoy your holidays! See you soon!\nteacher: sorry! I meant 1 pm for you!\nstudent: And thank you for your time!\nteacher: Thank you!\nstudent: I just noticed you inverted the times...of course, 1 pm for me!\nstudent: Bye bye\nteacher: Bye Sophia Smith, have a good week!",
    "student: hi\nstudent: how are you?\nteacher: Hi Sarah!\nteacher: All good, thank you :)\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: I am good too\nstudent: on Friday I went to Lavina mall\nstudent: there are some roller coasters\nteacher: I think I remember that one\nteacher: there ___ some roller coasters\nstudent: that's why I couldn't join our lesson on Friday\nstudent: oy\nstudent: are\nteacher: that's ok, I'm glad you had fun!\nteacher: sure)\nstudent: I forgot to type it, sorry)\nteacher: You did have fun, didn't you?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: No worries\nstudent: on Thusday it was my friend's mom's birthday\nteacher: whose birthday was it?\nstudent: while we were celebrating, we asked my parents for me to stay there for 1-2 days\nstudent: my friend's mom's\nteacher: your friend's mom's?\nstudent: I have friends Ethan and Sarah.\nstudent: and it was their mom's birthday\nteacher: Ah, I see! that makes sense now, thank you\nstudent: and they said that they would go to Lavina Mall\nstudent: so I skipped school)\nteacher: Oh no, naughty!))\nstudent: and had A LOT OF FUN\nteacher: Sounds wonderful!\nstudent: I was so happy after that\nstudent: and Friday was my mom's birthday )\nstudent: so she wanted to celebrate only with her friends\nstudent: without children\nstudent: so I went to the park)\nteacher: I see! you went roller coasting instead)\nstudent: I think it is one of the happiest days of my life\nstudent: yeah\nteacher: Lovely!\nteacher: Are you at home now?\nstudent: yes\nstudent: I came home 12 minutes ago)\nteacher: So roller coasters and amusement parks are really up your ____\nstudent: and I have holidays from now\nstudent: road\nstudent: oy\nteacher: what's that phrase that we use to say it's a thing you like very much?\nstudent: street\nteacher: Yes! up your street\nteacher: Or: they are your cup of ___\nstudent: tea\nteacher: Yes, well done!\nteacher: Oh, you're on holiday now?\nstudent: yes\nstudent: from now)\nteacher: Is that a bit earlier than you expected? From today you mean?\nstudent: yes\nstudent: the last day of school was today\nstudent: yes\nstudent: a bit\nteacher: I see! And how long is your holiday?\nstudent: about 1 week\nteacher: Ok, that's interesting. My son't holiday is next week, I was planning to cancel next week's classes, but we're still all right for this Friday if you've got the time\nstudent: okie\nteacher: Cool\nteacher: Have you got any special plans for your holiday?\nstudent: not really\nteacher: just to chill?\nstudent: just do the homework and see some friends\nteacher: Sure.

She told the teacher her dog had eaten her homework, but the teacher thought she was just making an excuse!\nteacher: Make sense, yes!\nteacher: to make excuses = to explain why something went wrong / why you can't do something\nteacher: the excuses can sometimes be true and sometimes false\nstudent: ok\nteacher: Ok, what about 'do'? Can you think of anything that collocates with do?\nteacher: except for 'do a funny thing'\nteacher: or just 'do something'\nstudent: do homework\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: and housework too\nteacher: Do you remember the difference between homework and housework?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: What's the difference?\nstudent: homework it is when teachers in school give you some exercises to do at home\nstudent: housework is to clean up the house for example\nteacher: Correct!\nteacher: Do' goes with lots of things to do with learning\nteacher: do an exercise\nteacher: do a test\nstudent: ok\nteacher: do a course (in coding, for example)\nteacher: do an exam\nteacher: do homework, as you said\nteacher: So you know, if it's food, it's 'make'; if it's school, it's probably 'do'))\nstudent: yeah\nteacher: do your best!\nteacher: Also, do + Ving\nteacher: do the cleaning\nteacher: do the cooking\nteacher: do the gardening\nteacher: and some sports\nteacher: do yoga, do running, do taekwondo\nteacher: Then we have do damage / do harm / do good\nteacher: e.g. Walking to work with do you no harm.

    "teacher: Hi Sophia!\nstudent: Hello!\nstudent: Finally\nstudent: The chat wasn't working properly\nstudent: Now it's fine\nteacher: All ok?\nteacher: Oh, it happens, sorry!\nstudent: yes!\nstudent: Hi!\nteacher: I can see that you tried to enter several times\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: I'm good. Just had my lunch)\nteacher: Oh, did you have a good birthday?\nstudent: So I'm not hungry and happy)))\nteacher: lovely))\nstudent: Yes. The birthday was great. Thank you\nstudent: How are things with you?\nteacher: Wonderful!\nstudent: I saw Emily Smith yesterday\nteacher: All good, thank you. I cycled into town this morning for what was supposed to be a nice morning out - a haircut and a spot of shopping. But it was pouring the whole time, so I had to wear my full waterproof gear including my wellies and waders, which took away from the experience a little bit))\nteacher: Oh year, how is she?\nteacher: *yeah\nstudent: What is a wader?\nstudent: Wow! Actually, this sounds like fun\nstudent: to me\nteacher: Waders are waterproof trousers usually worn by fishermen\nteacher: for wading into water))\nstudent: Emily Smith looks great. We chatted a little at a vegan place that she frequents\nstudent: I see. I bought those for Sophia\nteacher: Mine are really just waterproof overtrousers, I'm not that hardcore! But we call them 'waders' for some reason, I guess to make it fun for Emily\nteacher: So useful, aren't they?\nteacher: Are many vegan places in Kyiv now?\nstudent: cool! Does it really rain as often in England as they teach us at school?\nteacher: Yes! And we live in 'low-rain' counties (in the east)\nteacher: And it still rains a lot!\nstudent: There are plenty of vegan options in restaurants. Not many vegan-only spots though\nteacher: What surprised me about the English weather was the frequency and intensity of storms\nstudent: You're not a fan of the rainy weather, are you?\nteacher: They can be, like, 80 mph\nstudent: Pretty intense indeed\nteacher: I'm not sure how to convert into meters per second...\nteacher: But it's horrible!\nteacher: No, I hate it all - the wet, the windy and the cold\nteacher: I only like the lovely sunshine)))\nteacher: So my life is hard))))))))\nstudent: 129 kmh\nteacher: Vegan options in restaurants - very reasonable!\nstudent: it seems\nteacher: That sounds right, yes!\nstudent: Craaazy\nteacher: But again, we have it easy, the Atlantic coast is constantly battered by storms it seems\nstudent: I like rains but not when it's windy\nstudent: I can imagine\nteacher: Rain is a good thing in moderation)))\nstudent: I'm sorry Ms. Anderson. I'm going to take a 10-min break\nteacher: Ok, sure\nstudent: My glass teapot fell on the floor\nstudent: now the whole kitchen is covered in glass\nteacher: Ooh, yes, I'll let you go, speak to you in a minute\nstudent: need to clean asap))\nteacher: Oh no!\nstudent: thank you\nstudent: Ok. I'm here\nstudent: crisis averted\nteacher: Hi, oh good!\nstudent: I had to clean up really fast before Sophia comes back from her walk\nteacher: Sounds stressful!\nteacher: How are you? Upset about the kettle?\nstudent: We have tiles\nstudent: so it really shattered into a million little pieces\nteacher: Oh, yes, than anything you drop must smash, right?\nteacher: *then\nstudent: right\nteacher: Oh no! Was it a good kettle?\nstudent: It was a present\nstudent: and a good kettle\nteacher: Such a shame!\nstudent: Oh well, I guess we'll just buy a new identical one\nteacher: So that whoever gifted it doesn't find out :))\nstudent: And say nothing to the gift giver\nstudent: Yes)))\nteacher: that's it :)\nstudent: It's Sarah\nstudent: But tsss, it's a secret)))\nteacher: Ah, I know her! a little bit\nstudent: She's the one and only LinguaNova Institute admin\nteacher: Sure, I'm a grave)))\nstudent: )))\nstudent: I like this saying.. cross my heart\nstudent: and hope to die\nteacher: Yes, cross my heart))\nteacher: Is she a teacher as well as an administrator then?\nstudent: or something. I've always wondered about the etymology\nstudent: Yes. She's both. And a great friend.\nteacher: Lovely! It's hard to find a good administrator, isn't it?\nstudent: I'm meeting her today. Need to be strong not to tell her all about the teapot)))\nteacher: I guess 'cross my heart' comes from the action of crossing one's heart, you know, as part of a religious ceremony\nteacher: At least I always thought so!\nstudent: but why 'hope to die'\nstudent: ?\nstudent: It's something like 'I'll die if I tell'?\nteacher: Yeah, that's an interesting one. I'm not sure!\nstudent: I learned this phrase from a Maroon 5 song\nstudent: this saying\nteacher: I kind of only say it jokingly or to Emily\nteacher: I can't really imagine adults using it in all seriousness anymore\nstudent: neither can I )))\nteacher: What would you like to do with our remaining time? A bit of vocab practice from the book or something you might have in mind concerning everyday vocabulary maybe?\nstudent: Do you have a game with fingers involved that children play?\nteacher: Like rock-scissors-paper?\nstudent: I wonder what they say in English\nstudent: Maybe vocab practice next time if you don't mind\nteacher: Yes, sure\nstudent: Not the rock-scissors-paper\nstudent: the one where you make peace\nstudent: Did you have that in your childhood?\nteacher: Ah, I know what you mean! Where you hook your pinkies and shake them\nstudent: \u041c\u0438\u0440\u0438\u0441\u044c, \u043c\u0438\u0440\u0438\u0441\u044c, \u043c\u0438\u0440\u0438\u0441\u044c \u0418 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0441\u044c. \u0410 \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0448\u044c \u0434\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f, \u0422\u043e \u044f \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0443 \u043a\u0443\u0441\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f. \u0410 \u043a\u0443\u0441\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430\u043c \u043d\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0437\u044f, \u041f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043c\u044b \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0437\u044c\u044f!\nteacher: Yes, I know what you mean :)))\nstudent: Yes. That one!\nteacher: It actually means something different in this country!\nstudent: Really?\nteacher: The 'pinky swear' means you agree to keep a secret or swear to do something together\nteacher: Like, if we were in one room, we could do a pinky swear no to tell Sarah about the kettle))\nteacher: Also, if we were 5))\nstudent: ahaha\nstudent: Cuteness overload))\nteacher: The verb is 'to pinky swear'\nteacher: or 'to make a pinky promise'\nteacher: You can't break a pinky promise!\nstudent: so there's actually a verb\nstudent: thanks!\nteacher: It is super cute!!\nstudent: Thank you Ms. Anderson!\nteacher: Oh, have you had a chance to ask Jack about the expression 'bless'?\nteacher: It doesn't sound very American to me, but then, what do I know))\nstudent: one sec I'm going to ask him now\nteacher: sure\nstudent: He said he needs time to think haha\nteacher: Sure, it's not to be taken lightly))\nstudent: \u041c\u043e\u044f \u0437\u0430\u0439\u043a\u0430 he said\nteacher: Is Sophia out with her nanny now?\nstudent: something like\nstudent: Yes. Maya is with her nanny\nstudent: Bless her\nstudent: )))))\nteacher: Yes, that's what you said too, isn't it?\nteacher: That's it)))\nteacher: Do you know the very British meaning of 'nanny'?\nstudent: No!\nstudent: Tell me\nteacher: It means 'grandmother'!\nteacher: Colloquially, obviously\nteacher: My nan = my grandma\nteacher: In fact, in most families grandmas are called nans or nannies\nstudent: Oh yes, I remember it from one of the cartoons\nteacher: Or sometimes, for convenience, one gradmother is nanny and the other one is gradma or something like that\nstudent: Is it because they spend more time with the grandchildren?\nteacher: Than who?\nstudent: than parents\nteacher: Hmm, no, I wouldn't say it's because of that\nstudent: or nanny evolved from that\nstudent: Nanny, the profession I mean\nteacher: It's 'nanny' even if they only see her once a year at Christmas\nstudent: Got it\nteacher: I have no idea to be honest! Maybe that was the case\nstudent: So is it better to use the word babysitter?\nteacher: Also, I would say 'nanny' is quite working-to-middle class, shall we say\nteacher: I wouldn't expect a grandmother to be called 'nanny' in a posh family\nstudent: Interesting\nteacher: No, a nanny as a profession is definitely a valid word and quite different from a babysitter\nteacher: I don't think a babysitter would be expected to have the same qualifications as a nanny\nteacher: A babysitter is often a teenager making a bit of extra money after school\nteacher: Another phenomenon is a childminder. Someone who runs a small business from home looking after children\nteacher: As an alternative to a nursery / pre-school\nstudent: I see. Do you need a license to become a childminder?\nteacher: Yes, and I think you need to complete a training course, but nothing too rigorous as I understand\nteacher: Often, if parents are still at work, childminders pick up children from school, and only after that parents pick them up from childminders\nteacher: This is quite a common arrangement\nstudent: That is convenient\nstudent: Especially if parents are working late\nteacher: Sometimes at school drop-offs I see what looks like a family with multiple children. Like, one woman and 7 kids, but she is in fact a childminder))\nteacher: Yes, if you have to!\nstudent: Wow!\nstudent: I have to go now\nteacher: Right, yes, sure!\nstudent: Thank you for the lesson. I learned a lot today!\nteacher: I'll actually be on holiday next week. Our first half term!\nstudent: Yay! Good for you!\nteacher: I'm glad, and it's my pleasure))\nteacher: Thanks))\nstudent: So we resume when you get back?\nteacher: So same time in two weeks' time?\nteacher: If that's ok with you\nstudent: Yes! Cross my heart and hope not to forget\nstudent: )))\nteacher: I'll remind you in advance! :))))\nstudent: Thank you! Have a spectacular holiday!\nteacher: Take care, speak to you later!\nteacher: Oh thank you :)\nstudent: See you later!\nstudent: Bye\nteacher: Bye Sophia)",

You still don't have to!\nstudent: heh\nteacher: Ok, Samantha, a quick memory check!\nteacher: If two words go together, we say that they _____. For example, people 'elect a president', not 'choose a president' or 'pick a president'\nstudent: I forgot (\nteacher: collocate\nstudent: okie\nteacher: the two (or more) words collocate\nteacher: the stress is on 'cate': colloCATE\nteacher: and these two (or more) words together are called 'a collocation'\nteacher: Ok, I'll give you the second part of a collocation, and you give me the first, which is going to be either 'do' or 'make', ok?\nstudent: ok\nteacher: __ a meal\nstudent: make\nteacher: ___ a course\nstudent: make smth to eat, it is make\nstudent: *k\nteacher: Yes, correct!\nstudent: do\nteacher: Yes, sure. e.g. do a course __ coding\nstudent: doing something for studying is do\nteacher: Well done!\nstudent: of?\nteacher: in!\nstudent: ok\nteacher: or just 'do a coding course'\nteacher: Are you still doing your coding course?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Ok, cool\nteacher: __ an excuse\nteacher: Remember this one?\nstudent: make\nteacher: yes, sure\nteacher: __ a sound\nstudent: make\nteacher: yes\nteacher: __ damage\nstudent: make\nteacher: do damage\nstudent: oops\nteacher: There was a bad storm last night, but it didn't do any damage to our house, thankfully\nstudent: okay\nteacher: Building new roads does a lot of damage to the forests in the area\nteacher: something like that\nteacher: __ a mistake\nstudent: make\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: __ good\nstudent: do\nteacher: yes, like 'It will do you good to be outside more'\nteacher: __ a snowman\nstudent: yes\nstudent: make\nteacher: :)\nstudent: *k\nteacher: __ the cleaning\nstudent: do\nteacher: __ a test\nstudent: do\nteacher: __ progress\nstudent: do\nteacher: make\nstudent: ok\nteacher: e.g. We've been working hard but we haven't made much progress with this task\nteacher: __ the gardening\nstudent: do\nteacher: Yes, that's right!

Preparing for an exam is definitely a good way to learn English. It would really push and motivate you.\nteacher: Do you need TOEFL for a particular purpose? There are a few English exams to choose from\nteacher: As you know, TOEFL is American and would probably be good if you are planning to move to the USA\nteacher: IELTS is another English exam, and that is good for Australia, Canada and the UK\nstudent: I do not have a particular purpose. I just think that I really don\u2019t know how to motivate myself to learn English\nteacher: Right, I see\nteacher: One second, I'll just check one thing\nstudent: Ok.\nteacher: Right, as I thought, TOEFL and IELTS are only valid for two years. The purpose of these exams is usually visa applications.\nteacher: However, there are other exams that you can take that do not expire after two years\nteacher: So the certificate you receive will be valid forever\nteacher: Cambridge has a whole range of these exams, for example\nstudent: Can I take these exams in China?\nteacher: Cambridge B2 First is a good exam to start with. It will really push you in all the four skills (reading, writing, speaking and listening)\nstudent: Great\nstudent: I will check it later\nteacher: Well, the IELTS market in China is huge. This is why my husband and I were in China, he was an IELTS examiner then\nteacher: Oh, the links don't really work in this chat, I'll email it to you\nstudent: Wow\nstudent: thanks a lot\nteacher: It should be possible to take other Cambridge exams too, especially in Beijing and Shanghai. I'm sure there are lots of exam centres\nstudent: Ok. I think it can help me.\nteacher: For a lot of people, this is how they learn, by moving from one exam to the next. For example, after B2 you can prepare for and take C1.\nstudent: You know, in China, most of the time people learn English to do exams.\nteacher: Things like IELTS or local exams?\nstudent: local exams at school\nteacher: If you would like, I can prepare some exam materials for B2 for the next time, so that you get a taste for it\nteacher: Oh, gaokao?\nstudent: Wow. That would be great!\nstudent: yes, like gaokao\nteacher: Ok, sure, I'll prepare some B2 stuff for the next time\nstudent: Thank you very much!\nstudent: And I have another question, haha\nteacher: Cambridge is trying to make their exams as real-life as possible, which means that preparing for an exam does help with real life English speaking situations\nteacher: Yes, of course\nstudent: I really like reading fiction books. I know there are a lot of good books in English, but it's difficult for me to read them.\nteacher: Ooh, you're a good student, Sarah :) who loves books\nteacher: Have you tried to read any English books?\nstudent: Yes.\nteacher: What kind of books do you like in general?\nstudent: like And Then There Were None\nstudent: I think knowing a language can help me learn about different cultures\nstudent: I like fiction books\nteacher: by Agatha Christie?\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: Mmm, yes, good one\nteacher: I think one of the problems with older books in a foreign language is that they are written in an old-fashioned language\nteacher: which is probably more complicated than the modern version\nteacher: I would say, a good one to start reading in English is Ernest Hemingway\nstudent: So there is an old-fashioned version of English?\nstudent: The Old Man and the Sea?\nteacher: Yes, The Old Man and the Sea and his novels too\nteacher: His language is not very flowery\nteacher: Do you know 'flowery'? Lengthy with a lot of descriptive words\nstudent: Ok. But I think these are too basic, I already know the details about them.\nstudent: Don\u2019t know yet.\nteacher: What about his novels? I like Fiesta / the sun also rises\nstudent: I know The Sun Also Rises.\nstudent: So I can try Fiesta\nteacher: Have you read it in Chinese?\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: Sorry, I know 'Chinese' is not the accurate name of the language. I should have said Mandarin, right?\nteacher: It might be useful to read it in English as well\nteacher: What do you find difficult about reading English books?\nstudent: Actually 'Chinese' is a good for us in my opinion.\nstudent: the words I do not know\nteacher: Ok, I'll stick with Chinese!\nteacher: Got you\nstudent: If I keep looking them up in the dictionary, I wll feel that this book is not very exciting. But I believe it\u2019s my problem.\nteacher: I always recommend the first Harry Potter book to my students. It's written in (comparatively) simple language because the first couple of books were aimed at children, but the plot is really dynamic and it's easy to read\nstudent: Yes, I think Harry Potter books are a good choice. Although I have read the Chinese version.\nteacher: Ah, I see what you're saying. I think the secret to reading a book in English is looking up new words in the first 2-3 chapters, writing them down and remembering them, and then it does get easier! By the middle of the book you will probably find you don't need the dictionary at all!\nstudent: Really?\nteacher: Yes, and if you start with the first two HP books, by the third book the text becomes more complicated, but you will be ready for it!\nteacher: Yes, I promise :)\nstudent: I think your advice is really helpful!!!\nteacher: Give it a go and let me know how it is, ok?\nstudent: These things block me for a long time.\nstudent: Ok. Thanks\nteacher: That's actually what teachers call it, 'blocking words'. But every book has a limited number of these blocking words, and once you've learned them, they won't block you anymore\nstudent: Thanks a lot. It really helps me a lot to ask a native speaker English teacher some questions.\nteacher: You're very welcome. I'm not a native speaker of English, by the way. I come from Ukraine\nteacher: So I know from experience that reading a book in English gets easier if you learn all the words at the beginning :)\nstudent: Wow. I know your country.\nteacher: Do you? Have you been to Ukraine?\nteacher: I live in England now\nstudent: No. In China, many people say that Ukraine produces beautiful girls.\nstudent: And I know a football team that comes from Ukraine, but I don't know the name in Engilsh.\nteacher: Haha, well, stereotypes\nteacher: Oh my, I really don't know much about football! Dynamo Kyiv?\nstudent: I really don\u2019t know how to read the English name, haha\nteacher: No problem))\nstudent: I'm a big fan of Liverpool FC.\nteacher: Ah, Liverpool!\nteacher: I love the city of Liverpool, but sorry, I know so little about football!\nstudent: Ok.\nteacher: Do you watch a lot of football?\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: Do you play it too?\nstudent: And I watched a TV series about a nuclear disaster in Ukraine.\nstudent: Sorry, I do not know what it is called\nteacher: Chernobyl?\nteacher: Yes, it was a tragedy.\nstudent: Let me check the name\nstudent: \u0427\u043e\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043b\u044c\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0444\u0430\nstudent: From HBO\nteacher: yes, this is the Ukrainian spelling\nstudent: haha\nstudent: So why did you move to the UK?\nstudent: why\nteacher: Have you watched the TV series about Chernobyl?\nstudent: yes, exactly\nstudent: My English is so poor, I can't express myself fluently\nteacher: Well, I was an English teacher in Ukraine and I met my husband there (he was also an English teacher, we worked together). Then he was offered a job in Shanghai, so we moved there and that's where our son was born. And then we moved to the UK, where we are now both working for the University of Cambridge\nteacher: Your English is not bad at all!\nteacher: a TV show or a TV series, yes\nteacher: Chernobyl is a mini-series actually\nstudent: TV series\nteacher: It only has one season consisting of several episodes\nstudent: Yes.\nteacher: But yes, we call it 'Chernobyl tragedy' in Ukraine. It happened a year before I was born\nstudent: There are a lot of heroes in the tragedy.\nteacher: And you're very ambitious with your English, which means it will get better :)\nteacher: Yes, there were some true heroes who sacrificed their health to save the people\nstudent: I like the men who were coal miners.\nteacher: And there was also the dishonest government who let people down!\nteacher: Miners? A person who digs for coal is a miner\nstudent: They know they will die, but they are not afraid.\nteacher: Yes, they are not afraid\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: Well, I think they were afraid, but they knew they had to do it anyway\nteacher: actually, to dig for coal = to mine coal\nstudent: thanks\nteacher: The place underground where coal and other things are mined is called a mine\nstudent: I think I know, haha.\nteacher: So 'mine' can be a verb and a noun. An action of digging for coal etc. and a place where it happens\nstudent: In my subject, we often talk about data mining. hah\nteacher: Ah, good one! Of course!\nteacher: Does it mean you find the data?\nstudent: NO. it means to find something valuable from the data.\nstudent: Maybe a huge amount of data\nteacher: Got you. Like people mine the ground for coal / salt / gold etc.\nstudent: valuable\nstudent: Yes!\nteacher: Got you! Interesting!\nstudent: So nowadays we call it data science.\nteacher: There are a lot of miners' cities in China if I'm not mistaken. Is that right?\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: I see! We're learning from each other :)\nteacher: Same in Ukraine!\nstudent: Shanxi is the biggest\nteacher: There used to be mines and miners in the UK, but now the UK is importing all its fossil fuels I think. Maybe apart from natural gas. And now it wants to only be using the renewables!\nstudent: Sorry you are not in Shanghai anymore. I'm going to Shanghai to be a research assistant.\nteacher: I know! Such a gorgeous city! Have you been there before?\nteacher: And when are you going to Shanghai?\nstudent: Yes.\nstudent: Probably in November\nteacher: Exciting!\nstudent: I'm working on the application\nteacher: Good luck with that!\nteacher: What are you most looking forward to about your move?\nstudent: But the school's procedures are too slow\nstudent: Thanks\nteacher: Oh, I know! In all countries I think\nstudent: Next year, I will be a PHD at Fudan university\nteacher: Amazing!\nstudent: Thanks\nteacher: Oh, I've got to say. I'm going to take the next week off. It's my son's first school holiday! So I can't offer you a class next week, but we can resume classes in November. In fact, if you have the time and wish so, I can offer you two classes a week in November\nstudent: ok\nstudent: Thanks a lot\nstudent: Good luck to you son\nteacher: Would you be interested in classes twice a week?\nteacher: Thank you :)\nstudent: Ok. I think no problem\nteacher: Ok, lovely, I'll email you the times to choose from later on then.\nteacher: Good luck with your application, hope it'll all happen fast for you!\nstudent: Ok. We can, depending on your time\nteacher: Ok, thank you\nstudent: Really thanks a lot\nteacher: You're very welcome!\nteacher: Take care Sarah, bye!\nstudent: Bye",
    "student: Hi!\nteacher: Hi Sophie Williams!\nteacher: How are you? All good?\nstudent: How was your vacation?\nteacher: We had a lovely time not doing very much at all, thank you. A good book, lots of baking, a bit of gardening and Halloween!\nteacher: Are you under the lockdown yet in Austria? We will be as of Thursday\nstudent: It is a semi-lockdown, yes...it mostly involves a curfew and, for me, the fact that I now work from home 100% of the time.\nteacher: Are non-essential businesses shut though?\nteacher: How do you find working from home?\nstudent: Yes, non-essential businesses are closed, and there are limitations for bars and restaurants...\nstudent: I find it okay, but it is tough sometimes with the children screaming all around me (I have two small children, of 2 years and ten months...)\nteacher: I see! It's stricter in the UK in this case as I think bars and restaurants have to shut unless they deliver food\nstudent: No, in Austria too they can only deliver food..and after 20 no one should be on the street\nteacher: Oh, I didn't realize you had young kids! Yes, definitely a busy parenting period\nstudent: Unless for a medical reason...but bars and restaurants must be closed.\nteacher: Ah, yes, same idea, I see!\nstudent: I have never told you before ;) I would say that, by Italian standards, having a university degree and 2 children at my age is not that common...\nteacher: No, that's why I assumed you didn't have a family! As always, don't assume!!\nstudent: I see...avoid questions that might be problematic, that's a good idea.\nteacher: Yes, I don't usually start asking people about their families in the first class :)\nteacher: Do you mostly speak German at work? Or English? Or Italian?\nstudent: I see...well, I guess you now know the most relevant parts of my life ;)\nstudent: I mostly speak English, because my colleagues won't talk German to me until I can fluently speak it. But I sometimes use German too...and, since we have many people coming from abroad, I also practise my Spanish from time to time ;)\nteacher: Yes, I have a 5-year-old boy, he started school in September, and the government is trying to keep schools open this time around. We'll see how that works!\nstudent: While at home we speak only Italian...maybe sometimes English since all the movies we watch are in English...\nteacher: That's nice, that you can switch between languages so easily in your household\nstudent: I remember you talking about a child...here they are trying to do that too...the children are starting to go to a 'Tagesmutter' (essentially a babysitter at home, who can take up to 4 children and is inserted into the social system through financial aids etc.), but now they are home again since the Tagesmutter might have covid\nstudent: Luckily my wife is still at home, so she can take care of the kids, at least to an extent...\nteacher: It's a 'childminder' in English. Do the kids like it? at the childminder's I mean\nstudent: (I am still here, there was a connection problem so the Chat thought there were two Sarah Smith logged in)\nteacher: Oh yes, it does that, I can see you had to re-enter a couple of times\nstudent: I see...never heard this term before: in Italian it doesn't exist at all...they love it! She is a very nice girl, and has two children who love to play with our children.\nstudent: And it is also good for them: this way they can learn German...\nteacher: Oh wonderful, so it's just her children and yours then? Here too, childminders have a limit on how many children they can look after and they are 'competitively priced', that is they are usually no more expensive than a nursery/ pre-school and you can use your funded hours towards fees\nstudent: For now yes...actually her children go to school so in the morning they currently are alone, but a new child might come. Actually, there was an attempt but the child's mother was too protective: a child of almost two years who wouldn't eat anything solid, not even a banana...\nstudent: Here they are a bit more expensive than a nursery, but we couldn't get into the nursery because my wife is unemployed (she just received the recognition of her degree to work here as a nurse).\nstudent: And there is a priority list: so we were excluded because of the number limit which, I believe, was reduced also because of Covid.\nteacher: So if a parent isn't working, the family might be refused a place at a nursery? But that's a vicious circle, they will never be able to start work then!\nteacher: Here they are a bit more expensive than nursery; And there is some priority list\nstudent: Indeed...we also wrote something about my wife looking for a job as soon as she received the proper papers...but still, at least there are childminders.\nteacher: Could you have a look at these parts of sentences? Some articles are missing\nstudent: Here they are a bit more expensive than a nursery...I believe...\nteacher: yes, sure!\nteacher: I know with 'some' you probably mean 'some kind of a', right?\nstudent: As for the second one I am not sure...Maybe: 'And there is some list of priorities', but this would change the meaning a bit...\nstudent: Oh, yes\nstudent: Indeed, there is some kind of a priority list, that would be okay.\nstudent: What I wrote was more of a word-by-word translation from Italian...\nteacher: You can say colloquially, 'There's some list somewhere' or something like that, so it's not terribly wrong, just you seem to stick to quite formal English, and it stood out for me\nteacher: ah, that would explain it, a translation from Italian\nteacher: Shall we have another look at the writing you sent me?\nstudent: I should use 'some kind of' when I don't know an exact description, right? Like there is some kind of regulation you must follow...\nstudent: Yes!\nteacher: Not necessarily, you can use 'some' with a singular countable noun. Just thinking of an example\nteacher: Some Mr Johnson called this morning'\nteacher: To say 'I have no idea which Mr Johnson'\nteacher: Or you can use 'a' there\nteacher: A Mr Johnson caleed this morning'\nteacher: *called\nteacher: Again, to express that you don't know who he is\nstudent: Okay, got it thank you!\nteacher: Or, 'It was the Mr Johnson' (the one we've been talking about / thinking about)\nteacher: Anyway, Elon Musk!\nteacher: I would have said 'the Elon Musk' if he had a more common name, but it's not like there are many people with this name around\nteacher: the = that one, the one who created Tesla\nteacher: A beautiful inside view in the life of a man who seems capable of almost everything, that is running multiple complex enterprises which are shaping the world.\nstudent: that -&gt; who\nstudent: right?\nstudent: the one after the comma\nteacher: Ah, did you mean 'that' as 'who'?? Yes, who would be much better in this case because otherwise there is an ambiguity\nteacher: that is' reads as an explanation of the phrase before it\nteacher: like 'i.e.'\nteacher: Does this make sense?\nstudent: As always Italian is the problem: in this context the Italian word for 'that' and 'who' is the same...\nteacher: This child won't eat any solids, i.e. she only eats liquidized food\nstudent: I see it makes sense...if I wanted to write 'i.e.' then what would have been the problem?\nteacher: #ERROR!\nteacher: Hence the confusion in your sentence\nstudent: I see\nteacher: I believe it's a direct translation from Latin. i.e. = id est = that is. Is that correct?\nstudent: Yes, indeed.\nteacher: If you wanted to use 'i.e.' in your original sentence, I would argue that there would be a logical problem\nteacher: A beautiful inside view in the life of a man who seems capable of almost everything, i.e. running multiple complex enterprises which are shaping the world.\nteacher: running multiple enterprises is not the same as 'almost everything'\nstudent: as 'e.g.' means 'exepli gratia', which roughly translates to 'for example'\u00a0(but not precisely)\nteacher: Yes, true!\nstudent: I see...yes, I see your point\nstudent: after i.e. an explanation should follow, in my case I just continued the description...\nteacher: Yes, you've got it!\nteacher: a man who ... and who....\nteacher: would work better\nteacher: Ok, moving on\nteacher: I believe there are many lessons to learn such as his attitude when a problem comes, to focus more on 'how can it be solved?' rather than finding a scapegoat or complaining about it.\nstudent: I see, thank you...the difference between 'that' and 'who' is so basic...learning that I sometimes use them incorrectly is a surprise, but that is why I am here.\nteacher: This sentence is not grammatically incorrect, but it also doesn't read very well. For starters, could you change the direct question into an indirect one?\nstudent: ...(which is) to focus more on how to solve a problem\nteacher: You can use 'that' for 'who'. The problem was that it was creating an ambiguity in your sentence\nstudent: I think I would also need to add 'which is' after the comma\nstudent: Okay, 'that + is' might be unclear, I'll remember this\nteacher: Yes, I totally read it as 'i.e.' rather than 'who'\nteacher: when a problem comes, which is to focus... Is this what you mean?\nstudent: I am trying to refer to the attitude...\nteacher: It's a good suggestion, I like it\nstudent: Haha, thank you\nstudent: What about the indirect question...was 'how to solve a problem' what you were thinking of?\nteacher: ..., which is to focus more on how ___ ___ __solved\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: oh, how to solve a problem works too\nstudent: ...mmm...the alternative you were suggesting is 'how to get a problem solved'?\nteacher: how it can be solved\nteacher: How can it be solved?' changes into 'how it can be solved', right?\nstudent: Okay, I see..my example had one extra word.\nstudent: Yes, you are right! I don't know why I couldn't see it...I guess because I was thinking about the whole sentence I wrote\nteacher: It would just read more smoothly. Also, if you read you text out loud to someone who couldn't see the '' '', there would be a grammatical mistake\nteacher: No worries, like you say, that's why we are here\nteacher: And one last thing with this sentence!\nteacher: his attitude, which is to focus on ... rather than find a scapegoat and complain\nteacher: not finding and complaining\nteacher: Because you need a parallel structure there\nteacher: to focus (infinitive), find (infinitive) and complain (infinitive)\nstudent: Oh, I see!\nstudent: If you write only the [verbs], the structure is clear...\nteacher: You don't need to repeat the 'to' in front of every verb though, because the one 'to' works for all them\nstudent: I see...the structure is parallel because I used 'rather', right?\nteacher: Yes, the attitude is to focus rather than find and complain\nteacher: Not: the attitude is to focus rather than finding and complaining\nstudent: Okay! If I used 'to find' and 'to complain' it would still be grammatically correct, right? Though more difficult to read...\nteacher: Yes, it would! Could you rewrite the whole sentence, actually, taking into account the three corrections? This is the original again\nteacher: I believe there are many lessons to learn such as his attitude when a problem comes, to focus more on 'how can it be solved?' rather than finding a scapegoat or complaining about it.\nstudent: I believe there are many lessons to learn such as his attitude when a problem comes, which is to focus more on how it can be solved rather than find a scapegoat and complain about it.\nstudent: Hopefully I found all the mistakes.\nteacher: Yes! Lovely :) this sounds much more streamlined\nteacher: One quick thing from the next sentence before I let you go, just to get it out of the way\nstudent: okay\nteacher: Musk detailed about the history on how the first secretary of SpaceX finished...\nteacher: I would suggest 'Musk gave a detailed account of the history'\nteacher: detail as a verb is used more often with documents\nteacher: e.g. a report detailing the history...\nteacher: a statement detailing what happened\nstudent: Okay, so it is not people detaling the history, but rather documents...I see\nteacher: In any case, detail (object) rather than detail (about)\nteacher: Yes, but people can give detailed accounts of / talk in detail about\nteacher: go into detail of\nteacher: is another good one\nteacher: He went into detail of what happened...\nteacher: Sorry, not of!\nteacher: on / about\nteacher: go into detail about what happened\nstudent: I see..okay, thank you!\nstudent: My teacher went into detail about my mistakes.\nstudent: The teacher report detailed my mistakes.\nteacher: Haha, good example!\nstudent: Thank you!\nteacher: I hope you don't feel discouraged. You are still absolutely fluent in English, just the minor things here and there that might be worth tidying up\nstudent: I don't feel discouraged at all! I am just realizing how much italian influences how I speak...and how difficult it will be to improve the grammar correction system I am working on: these sort of subtle differences are very difficult to grasp for a pc\nstudent: Because you have to understand what you are reading; no computer can even come close to that...at least for now.\nstudent: So I am finding this very interesting :)\nteacher: My knowledge of what AI can and can't do is very superficial, I'm afraid!\nteacher: Anyway, I definitely have to let you go! Same time next week?\nstudent: Okay! Perfect\nstudent: Thank your for all the help! Have a nice week!\nteacher: Great, have a good week, speak to you then!\nteacher: You're very welcome :)\nstudent: Bye!!\nteacher: Bye!",
    "student: hello\nteacher: Hi Emily! Good to have you here :)\nstudent: hehe\nteacher: How's life?\nstudent: okay\nstudent: nothing special\nstudent: what about you?\nteacher: All good, we had a nice holiday. And now the UK is moving into another lockdown! It starts on Thursday\nstudent: lucky you\nteacher: Why lucky?\nstudent: I want a quarantine\nstudent: but I am sorry for your son)\nteacher: Haha, I see. Schools are staying open this time though!\nstudent: his first grade is strange\nteacher: sorry *for*\nstudent: what did you do on his holiday?\nstudent: okay\nteacher: Oh thank you, it is a bit strange, but he doesn't know any different, so he doesn't mind :)\nstudent: heh\nstudent: do you help him to do his homework ?\nteacher: We went for a big bike ride on the one day when it didn't rain, to his favourite park. And then we stayed at home most of the time, played, watched movies, did some gardening, did some baking and celebrated Halloween\nteacher: I do, yes! He is only 37 years old.. His homework is tracing letters, mostly\nstudent: nice\nstudent: why is he so young ?\nteacher: Well, because he was born in 2023 :))\nstudent: usually in Ukraine we go to school at 6-7 years\nstudent: like, I don't really mean that\nteacher: Ah, yes, I see! Children start school after their 4th birthday in the UK\nteacher: why he is so young ? Can you please correct this question?\nstudent: why does he go to school at 5 years?\nstudent: really? so early!\nteacher: I know!\nteacher: Why does he go to school at 5 years old? - possible\nteacher: But can you see a mistake in 'why he is so young?'?\nstudent: is he\nstudent: I didn't see that sorry\nteacher: Yes, of course) no worries\nstudent: *see\nteacher: Before we continue, 'a quarantine' has a different meaning in English\nteacher: If you bring an animal into a different country, on a plane, they have to go into quarantine (they have to be kept in a special place for a while in case they carry an infection)\nteacher: Now, because of covid, people who come from abroad must quarantine (stay at home for 14 days, not to infect anyone else)\nteacher: But when a country shuts all shops, cinemas, schools etc, it's a lockdown\nteacher: not a quarantine\nteacher: What's the situation like in Kyiv? Do you think schools will stay open?\nstudent: maybe they will close after the election\nstudent: I don't know, but I want it so much:)\nteacher: I thought the election was last week\nteacher: Are you getting a bit fed up with school?\nstudent: the second term(I think term )\nstudent: yeah\nteacher: Ah, I see, of course! the second round of an election\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Got you\nteacher: Did you manage to celebrate Halloween?\nstudent: it was my friend's birthday\nteacher: I remember, yes\nstudent: so when we celebrate , we always wear costumes\nteacher: Lovely! Who did you go as?\nstudent: I was death\nteacher: You were Death! OMG :)))\nstudent: but I didn't take a photo of my normal make-up\nteacher: with a skythe and all?\nstudent: in the evening it wasn't really good\nstudent: who did you go as?\nstudent: no\nteacher: I went as a witch! Because I had the dress))\nstudent: just the make up and a hat\nstudent: nice\nteacher: You didn't have a skythe?\nstudent: did you get any candies ?\nteacher: How were you going to reap your harvest then?))\nstudent: hah\nstudent: I didn't really need to)\nteacher: We had candles, yes! And my son went as Darth Vader\nteacher: Haha, that's good!\nstudent: not candles\nstudent: candies\nteacher: Ah, sorry! Well, there was very little trick-or-treating this year, unfortunately, but some people including ourselves put bowls of sweets outside their houses, we did help ourselves to some of those\nteacher: Did you go trick-or-treating?\nstudent: no\nstudent: we went to a haunted house and played paintball\nteacher: and ___ paintball\nstudent: a\nteacher: hmm, you mean you played paintball?\nteacher: it just doesn't go with 'went'\nstudent: ok\nteacher: it doesn't c-------- with 'went'\nteacher: Do you remember the word?\nstudent: collocate\nteacher: Well done, Emily!\nteacher: play paintball is a collocation\nteacher: And I think by scare room you mean a haunted room\nteacher: Do you know 'haunted'?\nstudent: yes\nstudent: but there weren't any ghosts\nteacher: Yes, but an atttraction at an amusement park is called 'a haunted house'\nteacher: with scary things jumping out at you\nstudent: there were two actors)\nteacher: I see!\nstudent: one of them had a chainsaw\nteacher: Ha, wonderful!\nstudent: and the second one was the girl from the film Call i think\nteacher: I haven't seen that one\nstudent: me neither\nstudent: but it is popular\nteacher: Oh wait, I think I know what you mean, I think I saw the trailer\nstudent: and the man had an electric shocker\nstudent: he used it sometimes on our friend Emma\nstudent: she was the first everywhere\nteacher: What, he gave her electric shocks?\nteacher: Goodness, was it even safe?\nstudent: she was really brave\nstudent: no, he didn't give it to us\nstudent: he used the electric shocker to make Emma scared\nteacher: aha, he used __ electroshocker\nstudent: an\nteacher: hmm, it's the one we've been talking about!\nteacher: the electroshocker, right? the = the one we've been talking about\nteacher: to scare poor Emma :)\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Sounds very intense, your haunted room :) Did you scare the actors back?\nstudent: and at the start of the quest they put me into a coffin\nstudent: no\nteacher: Oh my God!\nstudent: I asked one of them what shampoo she used\nstudent: she looked at me like 'are you stupid??'\nteacher: Haha, I guess she thought the question could harm her spooky image\nstudent: maybe\nteacher: Ok, Emily, a quick quiz\nstudent: but her hair was nice\nstudent: ok\nteacher: I used to cycle everywhere. vs. I'm used to cycling everywhere.\nteacher: What's the difference?\nstudent: in the past I used to cycle everywhere but now I don't\nteacher: good!\nteacher: and the other one?\nstudent: I am used to cycling everywhere means that you usually go cycling\nteacher: yes, this is my habit, something I do! Good one, well done!\nstudent: how do you know that I am studying that at school?)\nteacher: Oh really? At school or at Global Language Academy?\nteacher: This is a coincidence!\nstudent: at school\nteacher: cool!\nteacher: Do you know 'coincidence?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Could you turn both sentences from the example into negatives?\nstudent: I didn't use to cycle everywhere and I am not used to cycling everywhere\nstudent: I think\nteacher: Well done, yes!\nteacher: Could you make questions? with 'you' if you want\nstudent: Are you used to cycling everywhere ?\nteacher: Almost. be used to Ving\nstudent: are you used to cycling everywhere ?\nteacher: yes, correct! And the other one?\nstudent: Did you use to cycle everywhere ?\nteacher: Yes, well done!\nstudent: thanks\nteacher: And if we're only becoming used to something, we GET used to doing it, right?\nstudent: ok\nteacher: What are some things you have recently got used to doing? I have got used to washing my hands all the time, but I can't get used to wearing a mask. It's very uncomfortable, but it's also essential\nstudent: I have got used to wearing a mask, it is ok for me\nteacher: Ok, but 'get used to Ving'\nstudent: I have got used to wearing a mask\nteacher: yes, well done!\nteacher: any other examples?\nteacher: Oh, I can think of one.

Today I saw a doctor early in the morning\nteacher: All good, thanks! I've just been in town, it's sooo busy! Everyone's trying to shop before the lockdown starts tomorrow\nteacher: Today I've visited a doctor early morning' - tricky one grammatically!\nteacher: Today I've visited a doctor' - correct\nteacher: because today is not over\nteacher: but the early morning is over!\nstudent: He told me that it's not anything very serious and gave me a prescription for two doses of medicine\nteacher: So I would go for 'I visited a doctor early this morning' - Past Simple becasue it's the afternoon now\nteacher: Oh good! I'm glad to hear that!\nstudent: Thank you\nstudent: I see\nstudent: It's Present Simple )\nstudent: Sorry, Past\nstudent: How are you?\nteacher: Sure! But well done for trying to use more Present Perfect!\nteacher: All good, thank you. Keeping an eye on US election results, which is quite stressful, to be honest\nstudent: ))))) Now I try to use it more and more\nteacher: I've noticed! Well done!\nstudent: Me too\nteacher: Tense, isn't it?\nstudent: What do you think? Is it going to be the second time Trump will win?\nstudent: tense? Sorry ) Can't remember the word )\nteacher: If a situation is tense, it causes a lot of worry\nteacher: and stress\nstudent: I see )\nteacher: It can be in a good way, actually. If a movie is tense, it's a good thing, you don't get bored!\nstudent: Sure!\nteacher: I really fear it might be the second time for him, yes!\nteacher: The noun is tension\nstudent: But for parents of a toddler even a tense film can put them to sleep )\nstudent: tense\nstudent: sorry, autocorrect\nteacher: e.g. there is a lot of tension between them = their relationship isn't going well, there is a conflict, but maybe not an open one\nteacher: tenSe, with a S\nteacher: Just like tenses in grammar, Present Simple, Present Continuous etc.\nteacher: Ha, yes, new parents can still fall asleep!\nteacher: On the news, they often say 'tension between (the two countries)'\nstudent: thank you\nstudent: I see\nteacher: No worries) Oh, a game of football can be tense\nteacher: Another good expression from the elections is 'neck and neck'\nstudent: like tension between North and South Korea\nteacher: At the moment, Trump and Biden are neck and neck\nteacher: Yes, exactly!\nteacher: Which means they are very close and it's unclear who will win\nstudent: Actually, I dream about a trip to South Korea\nstudent: dream\nstudent: I like Koreans\nteacher: Oh really? Would you like to visit Seoul?\nteacher: You have a Korean friend, don't you?\nstudent: I know several who were our studens\nteacher: sure\nstudent: Yes! And one of them is my friend now\nstudent: She is a very nice person\nteacher: Hopefully one day you can go!\nstudent: With a very good sense of humor )\nteacher: Nice))\nteacher: Does she speak good Russian?\nstudent: I know that it's a different world, but I would be happy to see it\nstudent: She speaks Russian very well\nteacher: She speaks Russian very ....\nteacher: good - adjective; ? - adverb\nstudent: She studied here at school for several years and then she studied music at the Conservatory\nstudent: very well\nteacher: well done, yes!\nstudent: Where is my facepalm sticker )\nteacher: Haha, don't worry about it!\nteacher: I confused you with 'speak good Russian', but good is an adjective here\nstudent: Now she is working at the Korean Embassy\nteacher: Nice!\nstudent: And sometimes she plays piano at concerts with Ukrainian musicians\nstudent: She is a really nice girl )\nteacher: Oh wow! Does she play classical music?\nstudent: Yes! She loves classical music\nteacher: She is __ really nice girl\nstudent: a really\nteacher: Yes!\nstudent: You know in Korea there are lots of bands\nteacher: I think it's safe to say, with speakers of Russian / Ukrainian, just use more articles and Present Perfect)))\nstudent: hahaha\nteacher: Do English speakers find it difficult without articles in Russian / Ukrainian?\nstudent: K pop music\nstudent: no ) They don't )\nteacher: Oh yes, pop music bands in Korea!\nstudent: But she doesn't know them, she is in love with classical music\nstudent: )\nstudent: And her parents are artists\nteacher: Amazing! She sounds like a very interesting person\nstudent: She is!\nteacher: Thank for sending me your writing, by the way! It's really good, you successfully communicated everything you needed to say and it sounds nice!\nteacher: Hello Ms. Rodriguez, We will be happy to help you. Unfortunately now because of Covid restrictions we do not provide Russian and Ukrainian lessons at school. All the lessons we provide now are online. We can offer you individual lessons trough Skype or Zoom. Usually at first we offer a 30-minute trial lesson for free or one full time 60-minute lesson for usual price. Both options are available online. You can choose and return to us with the decision. The price of 60-minutes lesson is 500 uah. Also we would be happy to know which day and the time are preferable for you, so we can schedule you first lesson with our teachers. If you have any other questions, please, do not hesitate to contact us. Best regards, Alexandra from Lingua Academy\nteacher: So I've only got a couple of remarks, really\nstudent: sure!\nteacher: If a lesson is not online but actually takes place in a classroom, we can say it's 'face-to-face'\nteacher: You could say 'we do not provide face-to-face lessons'\nstudent: Is it the same with group lessons?\nteacher: Yes, sure. face-to-face individual / group lessons\nstudent: I see\nteacher: Another word for 'individual' is one-to-one\nteacher: a one-to-one class\nstudent: I see\nteacher: Sometimes abbreviated as 121\nstudent: But it's not formal?\nteacher: Hmm, it's fine, to be honest. At Lingua Academy they were always called one-to-one classes\nteacher: Or do you mean 121 is not formal?\nstudent: Yes 121\nteacher: No, you're right, I wouldn't put 121 in an email to a client. But 'one-to-one' is ok\nteacher: 121 is more for use between teachers at school\nstudent: I see\nteacher: Well done with not using short forms in your email!\nteacher: and I liked 'because of Covid restrictions' :)\nteacher: but I would put it at the end of the sentence\nteacher: Also 'at a usual price'\nteacher: not 'for'\nteacher: But on the whole, a very good email! I'd be very happy if I received it as your imaginary client!\nstudent: sorry\nstudent: I'll check\nstudent: Aha\nteacher: Ok?\nstudent: at a usual price\nteacher: at a usual price, yes\nstudent: Thank you\nteacher: No problem!\nstudent: at A usual price\nstudent: Of course\nteacher: But I've decided I'm going to be a difficult client with lots of annoying questions)))\nstudent: Article! ))))\nteacher: to get you to talk on different topics!\nstudent: Sure ))\nteacher: Yes, articles are like salt, just add some more, it won't hurt)))))\nteacher: I'm joking)\nstudent: Actually we have a lot of 'difficult' clients ))\nteacher: Haha, I'll try, and then you tell me if these are the types of questions you receive\nteacher: Hi Alexandra,\nteacher: Thanks for your email.\nteacher: Online classes sound good, but 500 UAH is unfortunately a bit too much for me. Could I maybe get a discount if I buy 3 classes a week? I'm happy to pay in advance if it helps\nstudent: Hi Ms. Rodriguez, it is nice to hear from you\nstudent: Yes, we have some discount programs. If you would like to have a discount, you can prepay for a pack of lessons\nstudent: If you prepay 25 hours of lessons, you will have a 5% discount\nstudent: If you prepay a pack of 50 hours you will have a 10% discount\nteacher: Sounds good, thank you, I will do that!\nteacher: Aha, good! I'm putting my teacher's hat back on now :)\nstudent: )))\nteacher: I liked how you started! With 'it's nice to hear from you'))\nteacher: Everything's fine, just a couple of things\nteacher: pay / prepay for\nteacher: you need 'for'\nstudent: My Lingua Academy knowledge ))\nstudent: I see\nteacher: Oh you could say 'buy', actually\nteacher: If you buy 25 lessons...\nstudent: sure!\nteacher: Also, I'm thinking a 'pack' doesn't really go with lessons. I would go for 'a bundle'\nteacher: A bundle of lessons\nteacher: I'm having a think about it now...\nstudent: Thank you!\nteacher: I'll get back to you on this one!\nteacher: Ok, next question from the difficult client!\nstudent: Samantha says maybe sets?\nteacher: Hmm, my instinct is to go with 'a bundle', but I'll look it up\nstudent: ok )\nteacher: My problem with learning languages is I hate learning grammar! And also, Cyrillic looks a bit scary to me. I just need to speak, you know? Can we only do speaking, please?\nstudent: ok )\nstudent: sure!\nstudent: ok\nstudent: My answer\nstudent: Dear Ms. Rodriguez, thank you for your question. We completely understand you, so we need to make sure that our teaching method is all about communication - it's the communicative method.\nstudent: All our teachers use it to make students communicate easily.\nteacher: Ok, that sounds like fun, we can just communicate then!\nteacher: :)\nstudent: In our lessons you will speak a lot and learn some words and expressions which are really useful for everyday life here in Ukraine\nstudent: At the same time you will learn some grammar basics and letters, but we are sure that it will be fun\nteacher: Hmm, ok! If you say so. I suppose you're a teacher and you know best :)\nstudent: because of our method of teaching and our experienced teachers\nstudent: Now I'm a student Alexandra )\nstudent: Ms. Rodriguez it's a very very common question )))\nteacher: Great, thanks for that! (teacher hat on :)\nteacher: Hahaha, I know!\nteacher: I can imagine\nstudent: I don't want grammar and I don't need to read in Russian or Ukrainian )))))\nteacher: Lots of people think they can just 'speak' and that's how they learn English :)))))\nteacher: So it obviously wasn't the first time you answered this question))\nteacher: Your answer is great of course in terms of content, and we can look at some minor mistakes next time, ok? I've copied it\nstudent: Ok! Thank you!\nstudent: It's time now\nstudent: Thanks for this chat )\nteacher: I'll let you go, have a good afternoon, thanks for today!\nteacher: And well done!\nstudent: You too! Thank you!\nstudent: too\nteacher: Bye :)\nstudent: bye!",
    "teacher: Hi Sophia Smith!\nstudent: Hello\nstudent: Nice to talk to you again.\nteacher: Nice to have you here :)\nteacher: How are you?\nteacher: I would say, because we're in a chat, 'nice to talk to you again' would sound better\nstudent: I'm OK.\nstudent: Haha, yes\nteacher: Any news on your application?\nstudent: A little bit difficult. A lot of stuff needs to be done\nteacher: When do you hope to move to Shanghai?\nstudent: Actually recently I've been preparing a presentation for a research assistant position.\nteacher: Oh, good luck!\nstudent: So maybe later.\nteacher: Have you had a chance to start reading a book in English?\nstudent: Yes. I'm reading Harry Potter\nstudent: Potter\nteacher: Oh really? Cool! The first book? How is it going?\nstudent: I think it's really good for me, because it's not hard for me.\nteacher: Exactly! That's one of the reasons I thought it would be a good book for you\nteacher: Have you learned any new words or expressions?\nstudent: Yes.\nteacher: Great, I hope you're enjoying reading it\nstudent: I think I am more and more familliar with the words.\nteacher: That's good to hear, lovely!\nteacher: I'm not sure whether it works in China, but I'd like to recommend a good online dictionary\nstudent: Yes. I really like it, but I don\u2019t have so much time now.\nteacher: the Cambridge English Dictionary\nstudent: OK. I will check it.\nteacher: It's a good idea for higher-level students to use an English-English dictionary because it really helps to start to think in English and explain things in English\nteacher: this is the link\nstudent: OK. Thanks.\nteacher: Sure. As promised, I've prepared some B2 First materials for you (for the Cambridge English exam). I've just sent you a pdf-file, could you check your email and download it, please?\nstudent: OK\nstudent: I have opened it.\nteacher: ok, great!\nteacher: This part is Reading and Use of English. This part of the exam checks how well a candidate understands some English texts and also how well they know grammar and vocabulary\nteacher: The other three parts are Listening, Writing and Speaking\nstudent: It takes 1 hour, right?\nteacher: Could you go to page 2, please? It says 'Part 1. What is genealogy?'\nstudent: Yes.\nteacher: During the exam a candidate would have about 75 minutes to complete this part. But we'll just do some bits of it :)\nteacher: Could you quickly read the text and ignore the gaps, please? And tell me what the text is about\nstudent: OK\nstudent: It talks about genealogy. And I think genealogy is like a tree to mark our family in history.\nstudent: And also do some research on genealogy.\nteacher: Yes, genealogy is the study of family history. A way to represent family history is a family tree.\nteacher: Correct!\nteacher: Ok, now for gap (0) you have an example above the text. You have 4 words but only one of them can go in the gap\nteacher: A band B set C branch D series\nteacher: Can you see it?\nstudent: yes. I know C is correct.\nteacher: Yes, sure!\nstudent: gap(0) has the answer on the top.\nteacher: Now, for the rest of the gaps, the words are on the next page. Could you have a look at (1)? What do you think the answer is?\nteacher: Yes, that's right, branch!\nstudent: (1) B\nstudent: rather than\nteacher: Absolutely!\nteacher: What about (2)?\nstudent: (2) B?\nteacher: actually no. Which verb goes with 'in'?\nstudent: A?\nteacher: C. result in\nteacher: to cause something (no preposition needed)\nteacher: mean that... (e.g. learning my family history meant that I found out some amazing facts)\nteacher: lead to. Moving to this country lead to me getting a new job\nteacher: But only 'result' works with 'in'\nteacher: Does it make sense?\nstudent: Yes. But I think it means because of tracing ... we get a result?\nstudent: Dose it make sense?\nteacher: Result is a verb here. It can be a noun (get results) and a verb (it can result in learning...)\nstudent: OK. I will check the meaning of 'result in' later. Thanks.\nteacher: Yes, sure!\nteacher: It's all about this 'in' here. You need a word that works with it\nteacher: Ok! (3)?\nstudent: (3) C?\nteacher: Hmm, no, B. access information\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: What about (4)?\nstudent: (4) D?\nteacher: Sorry, back to (3). Approach is more about a) physically coming close to something / someone b) talking to someone (She approached her boss about her holiday). c) dealing with a problem (I don't know how to approach this problem)\nteacher: 4 is D, well done!\nteacher: What about 5? It needs to go with ... that\nstudent: (5)C;(6)A?\nteacher: Correct!\nteacher: What about 7 and 8?\nstudent: But I\u2019m not sure 5, A or C\nteacher: 5 is C, remark\nteacher: We can say 'people remark that it's a good hobby...'\nteacher: But we can't use 'describe' there. We can say 'people describe it as a good hobby'\nstudent: OK. Thanks\nteacher: No worries. 7 and 8?\nstudent: (7)D;(8)B?\nteacher: Absolutely right! Well done!\nstudent: Thanks. But several times I actually wasn't sure about my answers\nteacher: So this is an example of an exam task. If you decide later on to prepare for this exam, we can do more exam tasks. Just let me know!\nstudent: I think it's a great exam. Thanks.\nteacher: This is fine, this is how you learn through exam preparation. By looking up new words / grammar points and seeing why it's this option and not another one\nteacher: Would you like to try more exam tasks in the future then?\nstudent: Yes. It's great\nteacher: Sure, we'll focus on that in this case\nstudent: Thanks, you really help me a lot!\nteacher: Also, I can offer you another class, at the same time on Wednesday if you'd like and have the time. So that you have two classes a week\nteacher: But no pressure as obviously you're pretty busy\nstudent: I really want to have more classes if you don\u2019t mind. But every Wednesday I need to talk to my professor.\nteacher: Ok, sure, let me know if there is any time that is good for you!\nstudent: It's about 12:00 UTC or 13:00 UTC every Wednesday.\nstudent: So can I pick another time if you don\u2019t mind?\nteacher: Yes, sure. Is 13.30 UTC on Wednesday no good for you?\nteacher: I can also offer you Mondays I think, let me check\nstudent: Sorry.\nteacher: 13.30 UTC on Monday?\nstudent: Yes. Monday is OK for me!!\nteacher: Lovely! 13.30 UTC on Mondays and Thursdays in this case :)\nteacher: Ok, I'll let you go, have a good weekend!\nstudent: I don't know what to say, It's really great, thank you so much.\nteacher: You're very welcome! :)\nteacher: Speak to you on Monday :)\nstudent: OK!!",
    "student: Hi, Mr. Patel!\nteacher: Hi Sophia Smith!\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: I'm fine, thank you\nteacher: Good to hear that!\nstudent: Today I've bought a new coat )\nstudent: How are you?\nteacher: Exciting! 'Today I've ___ a new coat'\nstudent: Ah, and new eyeshadow and two make-up brushes ))\nstudent: oh! Sure! Bought )\nteacher: That's right! But good choice of tense, present perfect))\nteacher: Sounds like fun! I've heard the forecast is for another mild winter in Ukraine\nstudent: I was so excited to use it that I forgot to use the right form of the verb ))\nteacher: But this is the correct use, absolutely! Apart from the verb)))\nstudent: actually, I don't know really about the winter, but now it's quite warm for this time of the year\nteacher: Interesting! and a bit alarming\nstudent: Maybe it will be another mild winter\nstudent: Sure, alarming\nteacher: At least it doesn't look like Trump is getting a second term!\nstudent: I've checked today but it looked like it was on hold\nteacher: Even though the situation still remains pretty ____ (causing a lot of stress because of we don't know what's going to happen)\nstudent: like yesterday I mean\nstudent: tense )\nteacher: Correct!\nteacher: And if the two candidates are very close and we don't know who is going to win, they are ___ and ___\nstudent: \u0442\u0443\u0441\u043b \u0444\u0442\u0432 \u0442\u0443\u0441\u043b )\nstudent: oh\nstudent: sorry\nstudent: neck and neck\nteacher: Yes, well done! :)\nteacher: I think just recently Biden's made a good progress, so he is a little bit ahead now\nstudent: sure\nstudent: Will see\nteacher: Definitely!\nteacher: Anyway, back to our difficult client who doesn't want to learn any grammar :)\nstudent: Now there are lots of memes about it\nteacher: Michael Smith's shown me some of those, yes!\nstudent: Like especially Russian people are waiting for the results\nstudent: Like babushkas and dedushkas discuss it )\nteacher: Well, they have had the same president for 20 years, basically\nstudent: We've decided with Carlos that it's a bit about us )))\nstudent: Or Trump in the 'costume' of Lukashenko\nteacher: Ooh, I haven't seen that!\nstudent: Maybe it's not so important)\nstudent: Carlos showed me yesterday )\nteacher: Well, I think we're a bit like the babushkas from the memes, but also, this election does affect everyone!\nstudent: sure!\nstudent: Ah! And I have just struck lucky with my shopping\nteacher: What do you mean?\nstudent: \u0424\u0440\nstudent: Ah\nstudent: Victory\nstudent: I've ordered an advent calendar for Aiden with Paw Patrol\nstudent: From the UK actually\nstudent: y\nteacher: Haha, lovely!\nstudent: And then they wrote to me to say that they didn't have it in stock\nstudent: And now I have a toddler who wants it and I don't have the calendar )\nteacher: Oh no! That's very tense! :)\nstudent: sure )\nteacher: Is it back in stock then?\nstudent: I have some time until December )\nstudent: I don't know. Now it's out of stock\nteacher: Ah, I see! Fingers crossed!\nstudent: I meant that today I've had a good shopping experience but two days ago I wasn't so lucky\nstudent: two days\nteacher: Ah, I'm with you now\nstudent: Can I use lucky not with a person?\nteacher: I've just been thinking about that. You can, but in this sentence I would go for 'I wasn't so lucky two days ago'\nteacher: But we can say 'it was lucky that the eyeshadow I wanted was in stock'\nteacher: or 'it was unlucky that the advent calendar was out of stock'\nstudent: It's clear now thank you\nteacher: I've been doing some shopping two. I've already bought all my seeds for the next year because I'm worried that there will be a lot of demand for them again, because of coronavirus and Brexit\nteacher: In the spring it was impossible to buy any seeds because of coronavirus\nteacher: In times of crisis, people suddently want to grow their own food\nstudent: Wow! And which seeds did you need?\nteacher: So they bought out all the seeds\nteacher: Well, I was ok because I had bought them well in advance, the previous summer :)\nstudent: haha\nteacher: All my vegetables and some fruit\nstudent: It's Ukrainian mentality I think\nstudent: I like to have everything in advance\nteacher: I was thinking that, but maybe it's just human :)))\nstudent: Maybe )\nteacher: I didn't used to be like that but I am now!\nstudent: me neither actually\nstudent: It's like adult life )\nteacher: maybe it's just a grown-up thing)))\nstudent: Sure )\nteacher: exactly)) we were typing the same thought at the same time :)\nteacher: I like to have ___ in advance\nstudent: Ukrainian mentality? ))))\nteacher: I would go for 'everything', not 'all'\nteacher: No, being an adult :))\nstudent: ah ))))\nstudent: Sure\nstudent: Everything\nstudent: actually what's the difference?\nteacher: I have everything that I need. Everything is so expensive these days.\nteacher: But\nteacher: You can't have it all.\nstudent: Is all more like an adjective?\nteacher: There is an expression 'to have it all'. It often refers to having a career and a family\nteacher: A woman who has it all\nstudent: Ah, interesting!\nteacher: Yes, exactly, all doesn't work as a pronoun\nstudent: It's clear, thank you!\nteacher: Except for 'All you need is love' :))\nstudent: Actually it was my main grammar rule ))\nteacher: Haha, I see!\nstudent: And you subverted it ))\nteacher: But we can say, 'We have everything we need here. The food and the Internet connection :)'\nstudent: Is it the right use?\nstudent: But the Internet first )\nteacher: Definitely! And in some cases everything = all\nteacher: Tell me all you know! Tell me everything you know!\nstudent: I see\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: But 'everything' refers to 'things' more. I like to buy everything in advance\nstudent: so we can use all as a pronoun if after it we have like a description\nteacher: Yes, like 'all you need'\nstudent: can I use All I like to buy is new clothes, for example?\nteacher: Yes, correct! You can't use everything there\nteacher: This is about all vs. every\nteacher: But that's easy, all + plural  vs. every + singular\nstudent: Thank you\nstudent: I will check it\nteacher: Sorry if it's confusing with all and everything! I can think of examples but it's hard to formulate a rule because sometimes they are the same and sometimes not :)\nstudent: Sure\nstudent: As usual with rules ))\nteacher: Yes, very often!\nteacher: Let's go back to our difficult client who doesn't like grammar for a moment :)\nteacher: What's another word for an individual class?\nstudent: one-to-one )\nteacher: Yes!\nteacher: And if it's not online but is actually in a real classroom\nstudent: face-to-face )\nteacher: well done!\nstudent: good girl like Ms. Samantha Bennett said )\nteacher: exactly)))\nteacher: I do wonder how he's doing now))\nteacher: Oh, and a few classes together can be a bundle / set of classes\nstudent: Me too. I like him\nteacher: I agree with Emily Smith!\nstudent: I will tell her )\nteacher: or you can always say 'a course', of course\nteacher: a 25-hour course, for example\nstudent: oh, it's a good option!\nstudent: tell to?\nstudent: or say to?\nteacher: tell someone / say\nteacher: good girl as Ms. Samantha Bennett said\nstudent: no to?\nteacher: You can use say to, as in Ms. Samantha Bennett said to me that ....\nstudent: Ah, Ok!\nteacher: or: he told me that\nteacher: (no to)\nstudent: clear!\nteacher: you have to use an object with 'tell', but you can use 'say' with or without an object\nstudent: shame on me )\nstudent: How many times I've checked it\nstudent: it\nteacher: No shame! it's a shame-free class)\nstudent: I check and forget every time )\nteacher: A very quick look at your writing from the last time! You were well prepared for the question about no grammar :)\nteacher: Dear Mr. Patel, thank you for your question. We completely understand you, so we need to make you sure that our teaching method is about communication - it's communicative method All our teachers use it for making students communicate easily. On our lesson you will speak a lot and to learn some words and expressions which are really very useful in your usual life here in Ukraine At the same time you will learn some grammar basics and letters, but we are sure that it will be fun because of our method of teaching and our experienced teachers\nstudent: Aha\nteacher: I have a bit of a problem with 'we need to make sure' It sounds like it's something you've decided you need to do in the future rather than something you're already offering your clients\nstudent: Ah\nteacher: I would suggest 'let me assure you'\nstudent: Should I use a different expression?\nstudent: assure?\nstudent: Ah, I see\nteacher: Let me assure you that our teaching method is all about communication\nstudent: Make someone sure\nteacher: let me assure you = let me show why you don't need to worry about it\nteacher: Yes!\nstudent: so need is more about the future?\nstudent: Because in Russian it's ok to use it\nstudent: to use it in this case\nteacher: Well, if I say, I need to buy an advent calendar, it's nearly December\nstudent: Clear! Thank you\nteacher: it's Present Simple, but I'm talking about something I'm planning to do\nteacher: we need to use the communicative method' sounds like we aren't using it at the moment :)\nstudent: aha, I see\nteacher: Then I would change 'make students communicate' to 'help students communicate'\nstudent: sure\nstudent: agree\nstudent: it's better\nteacher: aha, cool\nteacher: Same sentence, we use something to Vinfinitive\nteacher: All out teachers use it to help students communicate better\nstudent: I see\nteacher: Ah, we are out of time!

You don't have to carry your phone around all the time now?\nstudent: no\nteacher: Ok, Samantha. What's the word for something we do all the time because we're used to it? It's a h----\nstudent: the port for the charger and headphones is the same\nstudent: *same\nstudent: there can't be two things in it)\nstudent: habit\nteacher: Aah, now I'm with you re: headphones / charger\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Yes, a habit\nteacher: Remember we were talking about 'used to do' vs. 'be used to doing'?\nteacher: I used to do it = I did it in the past, but no more\nstudent: yeah\nteacher: I'm used to doing it = it's my habit, I do it all the time\nstudent: I remember\nteacher: Ok, can you change these sentences using 'used to do' and 'be used to doing', please?\nteacher: or 'get used to doing'\nteacher: I think I will very soon develop a habit of wearing my aipods all the time!\nstudent: I used to use usual headphones\nstudent: hehe\nstudent: But now I think I will get used to using them all the time\nteacher: Well done!\nteacher: this one is about me\nteacher: In the past, I walked everywhere. But recently I have developed a habit of cycling to places.\nstudent: nice\nteacher: could you change it, please?\nstudent: I used to walk everywhere\nstudent: But now I'm used to cycling everywhere\nteacher: The first one is correct, but something's missing in the second one\nstudent: I am used!\nteacher: Yes! :)\nteacher: Next one\nteacher: In the past, I was often late for things. But now I\u2019m in the habit of leaving the house early and arriving on time.\nstudent: I used to be late for things\nstudent: But now I am used to leaving the house early\nteacher: Well done!\nteacher: another one\nteacher: In the past, I ate a lot of chocolate. And I\u2019m still in the habit of eating chocolate every day!\nstudent: I used to eat a lot of chocolate\nstudent: And I am still used to eating chocolate every day!\nteacher: uh-uh! Caught you!\nstudent: where\nteacher: The situation hasn't changed, has it? So we can't use 'I used to eat chocolate' because I still eat loads of it!\nstudent: okay\nteacher: We can say, I've always been eating a lot of chocolate / I'm used to eating lots of chocolate\nteacher: It started in the past and it's still true!\nteacher: What about your habits? I bet you've got a lot of positive habits because you're very organized and get so many things done!\nstudent: I am used to using my phone too much when I am doing my homework\nstudent: It is a bad habit\nteacher: Ah, yes, it's a big distraction!\nstudent: I am used\nstudent: oy\nstudent: I am used to making\nteacher: That's because phones are so good at getting our attention!\nstudent: myself write down all the homework in my diary (school diary )\nstudent: oops\nstudent: not diary\nteacher: Aha, that sounds like a very positive habit!\nstudent: diary\nteacher: diary)))\nstudent: yes\nteacher: yes, diary products are those that are made of milk)\nstudent: but everyone is asking about homework every day\nteacher: you're used to writing your homework ___ in your diary\nstudent: I know\nstudent: out ?\nteacher: down\nteacher: write something down\nstudent: aaaah\nstudent: I understand\nteacher: I'm sure you've heard it before\nstudent: yes\nteacher: What are some other good habits that you have? Oh maybe a new habit that you've developed?\nteacher: I got used to recycling, for example\nstudent: I used to bring a lot of seashells from the sea from holidays, but now I don't\nteacher: Aww, I still do that! :)\nteacher: Good example!\nstudent: I am used to going to sleep\nstudent: *sleep very late\nteacher: Very late?\nteacher: lately = recently\nstudent: late\nstudent: I didn't know\nteacher: Ah, yes, it's a teenage thing :)\nteacher: I'm old, so I go to sleep early :)\nteacher: I'm used to getting 8 hours of sleep. If I don't get enough sleep, I'm tired and grumpy the next day!\nstudent: you're not old\nteacher: No, not very old yet, thank you :)\nstudent: heh\nteacher: What about recycling? Do you think recycling can become a habit for people in Ukraine?\nstudent: 7-8 hours is not enough for me(((\nstudent: I think it can\nstudent: and I would love it so much\nteacher: No, you probably need 9-10 hours of sleep, right?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Definitely! I know people didn't use to recycle, but maybe this situation has changed?\nstudent: yes\nstudent: For example , in Italy there are a lot of different bins for recycling\nteacher: Yes, sure. Are there recycling bins in Ukraine now? I haven't been there for about 4 years now!\nstudent: wow\nstudent: that's a lot\nstudent: I saw some\nstudent: It is not enough\nteacher: They are not available everywhere?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: I see! That's a shame! Hopefully, this can change soon!\nstudent: near my house there are some bins like 'plastic paper wood and glass' and 'organic'\nstudent: I hope too\nstudent: *hope\nteacher: aha, organic waste\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Just to go back for a moment\nstudent: okie\nteacher: I'm __ the habit ___ having a cup of coffee every morning'\nstudent: in , of?\nteacher: yes, correct!\nteacher: I ____ a habit of drinking a cup of coffee' = got used to doing it\nteacher: we need a verb in the gap\nstudent: have\nstudent: oy no\nstudent: used to have\nteacher: ah, I'm actually looking for a verb to go with 'habit'\nteacher: We can start a habit / develop a habit or have a habit\nteacher: start and develop - if it's a new habit\nstudent: have goes with habit\nteacher: Yes, it does!\nstudent: here it is not to start or develop\nstudent: *not\nteacher: Yes, correct! Either of them would work\nteacher: Ok, Samantha, I'll let you go. Have a lovely weekend!\nteacher: Talk to you on Tuesday\nstudent: okie, bye!\nteacher: Bye!",
    "teacher: Hello STUDENT>!\nstudent: Hello Ms. Rodriguez\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: I'm fine. Thanks\nteacher: How was your weekend?\nstudent: My weekend was busy, haha\nteacher: Ok! My weekend __ busy. It's in the past, so you need...?\nstudent: was\nteacher: Yes, good!\nteacher: Did you do anything exciting at the weekend then?\nstudent: On the first day I worked at the company, and on the second day I saw some friends.\nstudent: So what's the plan, are we going to do some exam today?\nteacher: Yes, we can do some exam practice if you'd like, but I want to just talk to you too, to give you a chance to use English and maybe troubleshoot a bit\nteacher: Do you mean you met / saw some friends or you dated them?\nteacher: If we date someone, it usually means we see someone as part of a romantic relationship\nstudent: I mean met them\nteacher: sure\nstudent: Haha, ok.\nteacher: My weekend was really quiet because we are under a new lockdown here in the UK\nstudent: Oh, sorry about the lockdown.\nteacher: Thanks, but it's ok! It's necessary!\nteacher: And it's ok for my husband and me because we both work from home, so it's not a problem\nstudent: So is the pandemic serious in the UK now?\nteacher: Yes, it's getting pretty bad again! Like it was in the spring. They relaxed the rules over the summer, and the infection rate has grown\nteacher: What's it like in China at the moment?\nstudent: China is already back to a normal life.\nstudent: normal\nteacher: Ok! Well done, China!\nteacher: Is there a vaccine in China then?\nstudent: No\nteacher: Ok, not yet then\nstudent: I mean it's not so clear about the vaccine thing\nstudent: China did well because it had very strict regulations.\nteacher: Yes, sure, China's good at it! And everyone wears masks\nteacher: There's lots of testing too, right?\nstudent: Yes.\nteacher: Yes, we can learn a lot from China\nstudent: Everything has two sides.\nteacher: Definitely\nstudent: In China it may be safe, but also people do not have much freedom\nteacher: Yep, definitely two sides of the same coin!\nstudent: It's good for the control of the pandemic, but not good for the government.\nteacher: Yes, sure\nteacher: I noticed that you're leaving out the subject in a lot of sentences (I think it must be because that's what you do in Chinese)\nteacher: In China __ may be safe\nteacher: but also ___ don't have much freedom\nstudent: Living in China may be safe\nteacher: Ok, good! Or just 'it may be safe'\nstudent: but it doesn't have much freedom.\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: yes, good, that works!\nteacher: One day worked at company, and another day dated (saw) some friends.\nteacher: Same problem here\nstudent: I spent one day working at the company, and spent the other day with some friends.\nteacher: Yes, sure, better, thanks!\nstudent: Thank you very much. Haha\nteacher: Ok, shall we go to our exam practice? Could you open the pdf and go to the second task, 'Motorbike stunt rider'\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: I spent one day working = perfect. I spent another day seeing some friends\nteacher: Do you know 'a stunt'?\nstudent: No.\nstudent: I do not know the meaning of this word.\nteacher: A stunt is an action, usually in a film or show, that looks dangerous and that needs to be done by a special skilled person\nteacher: Like running on top of a moving train\nteacher: Or jumping out of a moving car, or jumping through fire\nteacher: things like that\nstudent: OK. I know now. I saw something like this on TV.\nteacher: The person who does stunts professionally is called a stuntman / a stuntwoman\nteacher: Yes, I'm sure you've seen them\nteacher: Many actors have stunt doubles, who look like them, but some actors do their own stunts\nteacher: So a 'motorbike stunt rider' does dangerous things with the motorbike, for show\nstudent: OK. I saw someone fly through the fire circle on TV.\nstudent: I have opened the pdf.\nteacher: Ok, in this part of a test we have a text some gaps but no suggestions of words that could go in the gaps. You've got to figure out what goes in them!\nteacher: Again, (0) is an example, the answer is above the text\nteacher: I work AS a motorbike stunt rider\nteacher: What do you think goes in (1)?\nstudent: So the answers are always prepositions?\nteacher: No, not always!\nteacher: They can be 'grammar words' like 'have, has, does etc.'\nteacher: Or they can be prepositions that go with the word\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: or question words and linkers such as 'how, when, where, that, who etc.'\nstudent: (9) which\nteacher: Ah sorry, it's 9, not 1))\nteacher: nearly! it's a place...\nstudent: where\nteacher: Yes, correct!\nteacher: What about the next one?\nstudent: (10) so ?\nteacher: Yes, well done!\nteacher: 11?\nstudent: (11) myself ?\nteacher: absolutely!\nteacher: 12?\nstudent: (12) of\nteacher: in\nteacher: a degree in (a subject)\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: For example, I have a degree in teaching English an translation. What about you?\nstudent: I have a degree in communication engineering.\nteacher: Yes, good\nteacher: have a degree in - a useful expression for you :)\nteacher: Ok, what about 13?\nstudent: (13) which\nteacher: Yes, which / that, correct!\nteacher: what about the next one?\nstudent: (14) on\nteacher: Yes, sure! work on something\nteacher: 15?\nstudent: (15) from?\nteacher: Yes, correct! apart from\nteacher: And the last one/\nteacher: ?\nstudent: (16) this?\nteacher: You need something that works in a negative sentence. I never feel in __ kind of danger\nteacher: any\nstudent: Yes.\nteacher: Ok, but well done overall!\nteacher: This type of exercise is fun, isn't it?\nstudent: Yea. and I think I need to do some exercises after class.\nteacher: Feel free to finish the whole paper if you have the time! I can send you the answers so that you can check them, but if you have any questions, we can discuss them in class\nteacher: How does that sound?\nstudent: Great!\nteacher: Lovely, I'll email you the answers\nstudent: Thanks a lot. And I have a question.\nteacher: Ok, let's have a go at the speaking task. I know we can't really speak in this format, but writing your answers is also great practice\nteacher: Yes, go ahead!\nstudent: I want to buy some books about the B2 exam. But I don\u2019t know whether the book about FCE is correct for me?\nteacher: Good question! FCE is the old name for this exam.\nteacher: So a new or 'revised' FCE preparation book should be good. I'll have a look if they've published any books since they changed the name\nteacher: So I'll look find out for you, ok?\nteacher: Ok, quick 'speaking' practice!\nstudent: OK. Thanks.\nteacher: You usually do a speaking exam with another person, or sometimes with two more people\nstudent: No.\nteacher: You don't have to know this person, the exam centre usually puts people in pairs for the exam\nteacher: At the beginning of the exam, an examiner asks each candidate separate questions\nteacher: These are some of the questions. Could you answer this one?\nteacher: How do you like to spend your evenings?\nstudent: Well, first I like to have some dinner, then I go for a walk in the park. Sometimes there are some people dancing in the square. And I would dance with them.\nteacher: Oh, that's such a lovely tradition in China, I loved those dances!\nteacher: Good, thank you!\nteacher: I would say 'sometimes there are some people dancing', not several times\nteacher: sometimes = to show that it happens every now and then\nstudent: How many words do I need to say?\nteacher: 3-4 sentences is fine!\nteacher: and just 'then I go for a walk in the park', you don't need 'should'\nstudent: So several times != sometimes?\nteacher: Well, you can say, 'I saw some people dancing several times' - in the past\nstudent: OK. I understand.\nteacher: But if you see them sometimes in the present, and expect to see them again, I would say sometimes is better\nteacher: Ok, we're out of time for today! I've emailed you the answer key, so feel free to practice on your own!\nstudent: Thanks a lot!\nteacher: And I'll speak to you at the same time on Thursday :)\nteacher: It's my pleasure, bye!\nstudent: Yes. Hope to talk to you again!\nstudent: Bye",
    "student: Hello!\nteacher: Hi Samantha!\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: Great, thank you! How about you?\nteacher: All good, thanks. It's been unseasonally warm here\nstudent: Really? Here it is quite cold...\nteacher: Oh interesting! Maybe our warmth will soon reach you guys, or maybe vice versa, we'll get your cold weather\nstudent: We shall see...I hope it will get a bit warmer, it really went from summer to winter weather  in a matter of days\nteacher: How's the lockdown going for you? Are there any aspects you're enjoying or is a survival for you, with two young kids and working from home?\nteacher: I wonder if the climate in Austria is less affected by the ocean, with it being landlocked, so you're getting more of a contrast of seasons\nstudent: Well...currently it is mostly a curfew, at least the children go to the childminder in the morning.\nstudent: So, currently I am doing fine...I hope they'll let the childminder work, though, because the few hours of silence during the morning make a big difference.\nteacher: Ah, I see! That's good. It's a childminDer. Someone who minds other people's children, as in looks after them\nstudent: Well...yes, Austria has a bit more of a continental climate...but Graz is relatively close to Slovenia and the sea, so it shoud have the best weather.\nteacher: a few hours of quiet, yes\nstudent: At least, this is what they told me.\nstudent: Oh! I must have read it wrong the first time: I was wondering about what 'miner' and 'looking after children' had in common...\nstudent: Thank you for catching it :) Childminder it is, then!\nteacher: You sound a bit disappointed in the weather :)  I bet it's quite an adjustment for you. It still is for me!\nteacher: Yes, no miners! :)\nstudent: Haha...well, actually my hometown is quite a rainy place...but in Trieste I got used to very nice weather.\nstudent: How was the week of vacation? I guess the warm weather was a plus for you!\nteacher: It rained for most of the week (of course!) But we had a lovely relaxing time, thank you\nteacher: The warm weather has only just started, really\nteacher: Did you move to Graz for your job / research then?\nstudent: Oh...well, then who knows how long it will last...\nstudent: Yes, I moved here for my job: it is a very good position...and it is relatively close to my home region: without the corona it takes less than about three hours by car\nteacher: Sure. Could you fill in the gap: If it wasn't __ corona, it would take less than 3 hours\nstudent: for\nstudent: I think...\nteacher: Yes, cool. Just checking :)\nteacher: Mind you, every time the weather is particularly warm, which I love, there is always a thought at the back of my mind, is it actually the result of climate change and not something to be particularly happy about?\nstudent: I agree with you on that one. Climate is more concerning than weather over time...so a single day of warm could just be okay...\nteacher: Yes, but when there is a pattern, there is something to worry about\nstudent: The problem is that it happens so often and that the temperature is so high.\nstudent: Indeed...climate change, unfortunately, is a complex problem: everyone should mind it.\nstudent: *mind it...\nteacher: Yes, well, hopefully, it's not too late to act on this one!\nstudent: I hope so too!\nteacher: It hope __ too\nstudent: that\nteacher: so\nstudent: Okay...I agree that 'I hope so too' sounds better, but I wouldn't know why. Is it just how the verb 'hope' works?\nteacher: Just thinking how to explain it best\nstudent: (for this particular case)\nteacher: One second\nteacher: Hope doesn't take a direct object\nteacher: which makes it an 'intransitive' verb\nteacher: I hope for the best\nteacher: we need 'for' here\nteacher: Alternatively, we need a clause\nteacher: I hope that we will be able to avert climate change\nstudent: I see! Wow, this is definitely an Italian-related mistake, since in Italian 'to hope' is transitive.\nstudent: I hope that I learn how to use the verb to hope\nteacher: Aha, that will be it then, it's language 1 interference for you\nteacher: Exactly!\nteacher: And of course, it can be a noun as you know\nstudent: I hope to learn this.' would also be incorrect, right?\nstudent: I mean, 'to learn' would be the direct object in that case\nteacher: Oh yes, I hope to do something - perfectly fine\nteacher: no, a direct object would be a noun or something that can function as a noun\nteacher: read a book\nteacher: book - direct object\nstudent: okay...I don't know why I included anything answering to 'what?/who?' under the definition of direct object.\nteacher: Remember we were talking about the British vs. US use of write?\nteacher: In British English, I write a letter to my teacher. A letter = direct ofject; to my teacher = indirect object\nstudent: Yes, I remember vaguely: in the US people omit the 'to', but I can't exactly remember in which case.\nteacher: You know what, you're actually right. 'to learn' is an infinitive object\nteacher: Now that I think about it\nteacher: In US English, you can say, I'll write you a letter. or She hasn't written me\nteacher: In UK English: She hasn't written to me\nstudent: I'll write to you a letter.\nteacher: I'll write a letter to you\nteacher: direct object before the indirect one :)\nstudent: Indeed...ordering problem there.\nstudent: About the 'I hope to learn'...so would it be correct to use hope + infinitive object?\nteacher: Yes, of course\nteacher: hope to Verb; hope for Noun; hope that Clause\nstudent: Okay, I'll write that down. Thank you!\nteacher: hope for the best (not a noun, but a very common expression)\nstudent: I see, I would add that 'hope for the best' is a common expression given the current times.\nteacher: Ok, shall we have another look at your writing? I've got one last remark for the piece about Elon Musk\nstudent: Yes, please!\nteacher: This is about a parallel structure again\nteacher: it definitely is a must-read for anyone interested into  this incredible person or SpaceX/Tesla fan\nteacher: First of all, interested\nteacher: in\nteacher: Sorry, interested in\nteacher: But more importantly, the parallel structure doesn't work here\nteacher: It's a must-read for anyone interested in this person\nstudent: interested into' okay...I think I mixed it up with expressions such as 'I'm into math'\nteacher: First part is fine\nteacher: But\nteacher: It's a must-read for anyone SpaceX / Tesla fan\nteacher: wouldn't work grammatically\nteacher: and we need both parts to work\nstudent: Hmmm...\nstudent: It's a must-read for every SpaceX / Tesla fan\nstudent: that is how I would correct that part...but then, would the parallel structure work?\nstudent: I guess not...\nteacher: You can still make it work for both parts\nteacher: It's a must-read for anyone __ ___ interested in... or Space X / Tesla fan\nstudent: who is\nteacher: Yes!! correct\nteacher: Do you see how it would make both parts agree grammatically?\nstudent: Yes, it is apparent once we split the sentence into two parts...\nteacher: Last but not least\nstudent: anyone who is insterested in... anyone who is (a) Tesla fan\nstudent: I guess that a is missing?\nteacher: Correct! I was just typing about that :)\nteacher: You definitely need an 'a'\nstudent: Lesson learned: from now on I will try to split parallel structures and check them separately.\nstudent: Otherwise I find it difficult to find this sort of problems.\nteacher: Ok! I'm sure you will soon develop a feel for that\nteacher: Ok, the next bit presents a similar challenge. Not a parallel structure, but also a grammatical agreement problem\nteacher: I found this book interesting, though being packed with ideas, it sometimes makes it hard to read/follow  and some concept are, I believe, oversimplified.\nteacher: Being packed with ideas, it sometimes makes it hard to follow...\nstudent: Being packed with ideas makes it sometimes hard to follow.\nstudent: Would that be better? Even though i don't really like the expression 'being packed with ideas'\nteacher: Very good correction! You've made 'being packed with ideas' the subject\nteacher: Otherwise, being packed with ideas doesn't agree with 'it'\nteacher: because you mean 'the book', not 'it' from the clause 'it makes it hard to read'\nteacher: How would you correct this sentence? 'Having lost my glasses, it was hard for me to read'\nstudent: Mmm...I am thinking\nteacher: Let me know if you don't see the problem with it :)\nstudent: Changing the second part to 'made it hard for me to read' is an option, probably...\nstudent: The 'it' is not referring to 'having lost my glasses' (which is the subject)\nteacher: Yes, definitely\nstudent: But I can't think of what would be the correct word instead of 'it'\nteacher: But if you wanted to keep 'having lost my glasses', it would be something like 'Having lost my glasses, I was struggling to read'\nteacher: Because I lost my glasses, not 'it'\nteacher: You need the same subject in them\nstudent: I see...so there was no way to simply 'correct' the word 'it'.\nteacher: No, you'd need to re-structure it\nteacher: It's a very common higher-level learner mistake\nstudent: I see...well, it looks rather difficult to find\nteacher: I do agree with actually about the fact that 'being packed with ideas' is not the best choice of phrase\nteacher: *with you\nteacher: I'll have a quick look to see if I can find an exercise for you\nstudent: Great, thank you!\nteacher: I might prepare it for the next time if you don't mind\nteacher: What would you suggest instead of 'packed with ideas'?\nstudent: Mmm...good question...I guess 'full of ideas' would sound better.\nstudent: But I don't think it would be the best option.\nteacher: hmm, 'full of ideas' sounds more like praise, doesn't it?\nteacher: the book can be hard to follow due to a plethora of ideas\nstudent: Yes...\nteacher: or 'an abundance of ideas'\nteacher: just as an example\nteacher: Also, we could streamline the sentence a bit\nstudent: The abundance of ideas made the book difficult to follow.\nteacher: I found this book interesting, though occasionally hard to follow due to an abundance of ideas\nteacher: Sorry, my Internet connection is a bit wobbly, resulting in double turns\nstudent: Don't worry, my connection is also wobbly...\nstudent: I found this book interesting, though the abundance of ideas made it at times hard to follow.'\nteacher: Ok, we will continue our quest for better ways to write in English next time if it's ok with you! Pretty much an endless process :)\nteacher: I like it, yes!!\nteacher: Very concise, too\nstudent: I agree, an endless process. Thank you for your time and help!\nteacher: It's my pleasure!\nstudent: Next week, same time, same place?\nteacher: Yes, barring any disasters :)\nteacher: Speak to you then!\nstudent: Yes, thank you! Bye bye!",
    "student: hello\nteacher: Hi Emily!\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: fine! and you?\nteacher: All good, thank you!\nstudent: I forgot to tell you about a nice thing!\nteacher: Go on!\nstudent: I set up a little business with my friend Samantha!\nteacher: Seriously? Oh wow!\nteacher: set-set-set, irregular verb\nstudent: ok\nteacher: so 'I __ up a business'\nstudent: I set up a business\nteacher: yes, or even better 'I've set up a business'\nteacher: anyway, what's your business?\nstudent: we are selling some accessories\nstudent: our Instagram is @lifestyle_adventurer\nteacher: Ok, I'll check it out :)\nteacher: What kind of accessories? Hats, jewellery, scarves?\nstudent: accessories from beads\nstudent: jewellery\nteacher: Cool! Do you make them yourselves?\nstudent: in future we also want to sell some scrunchies\nstudent: *scrunchies\nteacher: yes, good correction!\nteacher: Exciting!\nteacher: So where does your supply come from?\nstudent: my friend makes them, and I post to Instagram and TikTok, it is like an advertisement\nstudent: what do you mean?\nteacher: That's what I meant, where your supply of products comes from. Your friend makes them)\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Exciting! So you're in charge of marketing and the actual transactions?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Wonderful!\nteacher: And how is it going? Are you making sales?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Lovely! exciting for you both, right?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: cool\nstudent: but now I am in the red I think\nteacher: what do you mean?\nstudent: like we bought me some beads for 300 hrn\nstudent: me*\nstudent: and now we both received about 150 hrn\nstudent: *n\nteacher: ah, I see\nteacher: the expressions are 'make a loss' vs. 'made a profit'\nstudent: ok\nteacher: So far, you've made a loss, but this is to be expected for a new business!\nstudent: yes\nteacher: You can't expect to make a lot of profit straightaway I guess\nstudent: yeah\nteacher: And if you have put 300 UAH into your business and then earned 300 UAH back, you have broken even\nstudent: okay\nteacher: to break even = to get the money you invested back but not to make a profit\nstudent: I see\nstudent: thanks)\nteacher: there was another business word, it's on the tip of my tongue, one second!\nteacher: that's it, revenue!\nteacher: The stress is on the first syllable\nteacher: rEvenue\nteacher: this is all the money your business earns\nteacher: but not all of it is profit\nteacher: some of it is covering your costs\nteacher: For example, you have bought materials for 150 UAH and you've earned 200 UAH. Your revenue is 200 UAH\nteacher: What's your profit?\nstudent: 50 UAH\nteacher: Correct! Simple math + English :)\nteacher: If your costs are 150 UAH and you've earned 100 UAH, you've .....\nteacher: made a ___\nstudent: made a loss of 50 uah?\nteacher: Correct!\nteacher: And if your costs are 150 UAH and you've earned 150 UAH?\nstudent: you broke even\nteacher: correct, you've broken even :)\nteacher: Well, anyway, I wish you to make a profit and also have fun!\nstudent: thanks!\nteacher: So you know how this time of the year is a bit unexciting in the UK. The weather is often pretty awful and the nights are drawing in\nteacher: But! There are some festivals that people celebrate, to cheer themselves u\nteacher: up\nteacher: Obviously, there's Halloween. But I wonder if you know about some other festivals in the UK?\nstudent: no\nteacher: Do you know about Bonfire Night?\nstudent: no\nteacher: No worries. It's on November 5. There are usually fireworks and a bonfire\nstudent: nice\nstudent: what do you\nstudent: celebrate on this day?\nteacher: Back in 1606 there was an idea to burn down the Houses of Parliament because some people were dissatisfied with the government\nteacher: It was called the Gunpowder Plot\nteacher: They made a tunnel underneath the Houses of Parliament and put the gunpowder in it\nteacher: And a man called Guy Fawkes was supposed to light that gunpowder and blow up the parliament\nteacher: But he was caught and couldn't do that\nstudent: his real name was Guy ? :/\nteacher: And the government wanted people to celebrate this fact\nteacher: and they still do :)\nteacher: Yes, a real person!\nstudent: hah\nstudent: nice\nteacher: Oh, I see, yes, Guy is not a very common name, but there are people called Guy\nstudent: oh yes\nstudent: I see\nteacher: And usually there is a big bonfire and fireworks\nteacher: But guess what, not this year of course\nstudent: sad\nteacher: Still, people buy fireworks and sparkles\nteacher: We had a bonfire in our garden and ate pizza\nstudent: good idea for the situation with corona)\nteacher: But I actually wanted to tell you about a different festival that is widely celebrated in the UK around this time!\nteacher: It's called Diwali\nteacher: Have you heard of Diwali?\nstudent: no\nteacher: It's an important Indian festival\nteacher: Why do you think it's celebrated in the UK?\nstudent: something connected to history?\nteacher: definitely\nteacher: There are a lot of people from India in the UK!\nteacher: Again, do you know why?\nstudent: not really\nteacher: Ok, no problem. India was under the British rule for a long long time\nteacher: 1757-1947\nteacher: Nearly 200 years\nteacher: And a lot of people from India moved to the UK. Just like a lot of people from the UK lived in India at the time.\nstudent: 190 years\nteacher: that's right\nteacher: Indian food and Indian cultures are very important in the UK\nteacher: *culture\nteacher: well, food is part of culture\nteacher: But in every little town, there is at least one Indian restaurant. British people love Indian food!\nstudent: cool\nteacher: And people who came to the UK from India as well as their families are now an important part of the population.\nteacher: I bet their celebration of Diwali will also be different this year, but still!\nstudent: a history + English lesson)\nteacher: Hope you don't mind :)\nstudent: what do you do on Diwali?\nstudent: of course not! it is interesting and nice to know\nteacher: Well, we don't celebrate it because we are an English-Ukrainian family. And our town is so small that not much is done, but a lot happens in bigger places where there are bigger Indian communities\nteacher: We're going to read about it in a minute\nteacher: Just a few words to get us started\nstudent: okie\nteacher: the word for a light inside a container (glass for example) that has a handle for holding it\nteacher: a lantern\nteacher: the stress is on the first syllable, lAntern\nteacher: next one\nteacher: If two things happen at the same time, they coincide\nteacher: cOincide\nteacher: with each other\nteacher: For example, I organized my holiday so that coincided with my son's\nteacher: In the text it will say that Diwali needs to coincide with the new moon\nteacher: which is why the exact date changes\nteacher: Are all these clear for now?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: You probably know the noun for coincide\nteacher: ??\nteacher: He said it at the same time as I did. It was a .....\nstudent: coincidence\nteacher: Well done:)\nteacher: And one last!\nteacher: Do you know what a henna tattoo is? I wonder if they are popular in Ukraine\nteacher: Henna is this orange plant-based paint\nstudent: yeah\nteacher: So people do temporary tattoos with it. They wash away with time\nteacher: Do people do this in Ukraine?\nteacher: often on their hands and arms\nstudent: sometimes yes\nstudent: they do\nteacher: Cool! Ok, I'll send you the link to the text. Have a read and say what Diwali is a celebration of, ok?\nteacher: https://learnenglishteens.britishcouncil.org/uk-now/read-uk/diwali\nteacher: Does the link work?\nstudent: yes\nstudent: I am here again\nteacher: Ok!

Ukrainian, or maybe something you saw in Israel or Italy or wherever\nteacher: and tell me about it next time\nteacher: Ok?\nstudent: okay\nteacher: Ok, lovely. Take care :)\nstudent: have a nice day!\nteacher: Thanks, you too :)",

When does Liam wake up?\nteacher: At 7. I get up at 6.30 to have a shower in peace and start making breakfast. We have to be at school for 8.45\nstudent: Liam wakes up and has her routines.

I accompany her all the time )))))\nstudent: 6:30 is really early\nstudent: we wake up at around 8\nteacher: Aww, it's so cute that she loves cars and trucks!\nstudent: Now she's also into papa's tools\nteacher: cars and trucks? or 'the' cars and trucks in your sentence? what do you think?\nstudent: Goes around the house fixing everything with a screwdriver\nteacher: as in screwdrivers and stuff?\nteacher: Haha, so cute!\nstudent: the' should be dropped\nteacher: Yeah, I think so too. Because it's all cars and trucks, not some in particular\nstudent: OK! Thanks\nteacher: and I would say 'She looks at cars and trucks through the window'\nstudent: got it\nteacher: When we first moved to this house, Liam was nearly 2, and there was a building site next to it. I have countless pictures of him watching diggers through the window\nstudent: He was mesmerized by them?))\nteacher: Ah, good word! Definitely!\nteacher: What would you like to focus on today?

Right now David is giving a zoom lesson on Python (a programming language) to his Japanese friend\nteacher: Oh wow! I didn't know David taught coding!\nstudent: Yes, we sometimes meet all together sometimes we come in turns. Brave new world\nteacher: Indeed\nstudent: He didn't know it either.\nteacher: Oh, I saw a funny meme this morning! There was the portrait of Rene Descartes (I hope I spelled that right)\nstudent: The Japanese guy is happy to bits because David is very good at explaining difficult stuff\nteacher: and it went 'Covido, ergo zoom'\nteacher: made me laugh\nstudent: ahahahah\nstudent: I think I've seen that meme\nteacher: Haha, lovely!\nteacher: Have you managed to download the book?\nstudent: Ok I opened the book\nteacher: Cool, thanks!

It's page 28 in the book\nstudent: Which page should I go to?\nstudent: Oh\nstudent: done\nstudent: collocations\nteacher: yes, correct!\nteacher: I don't think you need much of an introduction to collocations)\nteacher: you know perfectly well how they work\nstudent: Yes. I know what they are\nteacher: So let's dive straight into practice (bottom right corner of the page)!\nteacher: There are some nice juicy collocations there\nstudent: Sure\nstudent: Should I just write you the letters?\nteacher: could you actually write words?\nstudent: OK\nstudent: 1) limit\nstudent: 2) boom\nteacher: or better yet, collocations 1) time limit (of course)\nteacher: bumper! bumper harvest\nstudent: really?\nteacher: or bumper crop\nteacher: Yes)) my gardener's dream every year :)\nstudent: bumper wine harvest\nteacher: I've had a bumper crop of French beans this year, but courgettes let me down))\nstudent: Wow!\nteacher: Hmm, I think it's more a bumper harvest of grapes))\nstudent: You're quite a gardener!\nstudent: I see\nstudent: Thanks\nteacher: I'm just learning)) but I love it\nstudent: 3) update\nstudent: update someone on sth\nteacher: sure!\nstudent: dim and distant past\nstudent: 4) ...\nteacher: dim and distant past!\nteacher: dim' as in you can't see very well through it\nstudent: Ok! Note taken\nstudent: 5) a monumental year\nteacher: Ah! a momentous year!\nteacher: I guess because 'momento' means remember, right?\nstudent: right\nstudent: ok\nteacher: or 'memento'? you should know Latin better))\nteacher: than me\nteacher: with your degree in Spanish))\nteacher: so a momentous year = a year to remember\nstudent: yes, probably memento\nstudent: got it\nteacher: I'm sure 2020 can be called a momentous year!\nstudent: 6) synchronised\nteacher: yes, sure!\nstudent: 7) whole-heartedly agree\nteacher: yes!\nstudent: 8) satisfied with\nteacher: yes, piece of cake!)\nstudent: 9) adversely affected\nteacher: correct\nstudent: 10) passionately committed\nteacher: Yes, correct!\nstudent: yay\nstudent: ))\nteacher: Yay!\nstudent: next?\nteacher: Just wanted to tell you a story\nstudent: Sure. Happy to hear it\nteacher: It made me think of my first director. She had just opened \"Lingua Nova Institute\", and I was one of the first hires. We were a tiny school, and she used to say, 'We have two problems. No harvest and a bumper harvest' :))\nteacher: meaning 'no students and too many students'\nteacher: I wonder if this is something you can relate to as the director of \"Campus Creations\"?\nstudent: This is so true\nstudent: I think it can be applied to most language schools\nteacher: I'm guessing especially at the beginning when you're trying to get established, right?\nstudent: both are equally difficult to handle\nteacher: What was it like for you guys?\nstudent: To tell you the truth\nstudent: It was always harder for me to handle bumper harvests\nstudent: emotionally I mean\nteacher: Oh, because you gelt you couldn't say no?\nteacher: *felt\nstudent: Because it was too much\nstudent: of everything\nstudent: giving classes, administering\nteacher: Oh yes, was it before you hired an administrator?\nstudent: doing marketing, liaising with clients\nteacher: Crazy!!\nstudent: Yes, it was before Sophia assumed (?) admin responsibilities\nteacher: Yes, assumes responsibilities = fine\nteacher: or 'took on'\nstudent: Ah yes!\nstudent: That's what I had in mind\nstudent: And there was a time when I shared two jobs\nstudent: One at \"Campus Creations\", another one at the uni\nstudent: and at some point it was three\nteacher: Ah, I think I remember that!\nstudent: Anyway, I'm happy those days are over\nstudent: I'm\nteacher: I bet!

I think you're right\nstudent: I think\nteacher: I agree with you, though. In the blink of an eye is more common!\nteacher: Oh, do you have to go? Or have you got 10 more minutes?\nstudent: 4) immemorial\nteacher: Correct! I think we've missed one\nstudent: Yes I have 10 more mins if you are available\nteacher: I do too\nteacher: Oh no, sorry, I'm with you now!\nteacher: 4. in next to no time\nstudent: yes. That's what I wanted to write\nstudent: 4) next\nstudent: 5) immemorial\nstudent: sorry\nteacher: That's what I thought, no worries :)\nteacher: both correct, yes\nstudent: But\nstudent: immemorial was just a guess\nstudent: dunno what it means\nteacher: Ah, since the time that we can't remember\nteacher: since God knows how long ago :))\nstudent: What a beautiful way to  say it\nteacher: I know, very elegant!\nstudent: you stress the -MO- syllable, right?\nteacher: yes, that's right!\nstudent: Thanks!\nstudent: 6) in the nick of time\nstudent: 7) to kill time\nteacher: Yes, perfect\nstudent: 8) a time-consuming job\nstudent: 9) a long-standing agreement\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: yes to both\nstudent: 10) in a matter of mins\nteacher: Correct!\nstudent: Yay!\nteacher: As you can see, all collocations to do with time)\nteacher: well, not all the collocations to do with time, but every collocation in this exercise :)\nstudent: Oh yes. Very commonly used\nstudent: )))\nteacher: Which ones did you like best?\nstudent: since time immemorial, of course\nteacher: !! :)\nstudent: look at the abundance of 'm's\nteacher: that's it, beautiful!\nstudent: sounds like poetry to me\nteacher: We've been having a bit of a Ukrainian food renaissance recently, and I must say, I'm not sure about French food, but cooking Ukrainian is a very time-consuming business!\nstudent: borshch for one\nstudent: What did you cook?\nteacher: Borshch! and also a version of holubtsy, but with beetroot leaves\nteacher: and vegetarian\nstudent: nice\nstudent: love it\nstudent: Very time-consuming\nteacher: and Ukrainian pickles! sauerkraut and Korean carrots\nstudent: yum!\nteacher: Well, the renaissance is due to the discovery of Olia Hercules who promotes wonderful Ukrainian food in the UK\nstudent: Oh yes\nteacher: I was telling Sara Williams about her\nstudent: Sara Williams told me about her\nstudent: I looked her up\nteacher: Yes, we've been cooking from her book!\nstudent: Great!

Getting really nostalgic about this stuff\nteacher: I mean 'talk to you'))\nstudent: Imagine how much time cooking vareniki takes\nteacher: I know! All the prep! But the reward is considerable))\nstudent: Oh yes! Love it\nstudent: Ok! Thank you very much for the lesson\nteacher: It's my pleasure! Take care :)\nstudent: Next week same time is perfect\nteacher: Lovely!\nstudent: If nothing changes of course\nstudent: You, too\nteacher: We'll keep in touch on that, no problem\nstudent: Have a great day!\nteacher: Thank you!

    "student: Hi, Ms. Hayes!\nteacher: Hiya!\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: Fine, Thank you\nteacher: How's your week going?Anything exciting?\nstudent: First yoga after the break  )\nteacher: Cool! I'm glad you're feeling better!\nstudent: You know that my back hurt\nteacher: Could you make a full sentence, please?\nteacher: I_ __ my first yoga after the break'\nteacher: I know! How's your back now?\nstudent: I've had my first yoga today )\nteacher: Well done :)\nstudent: How are you?\nteacher: Same old, same old! Nothing much seems to be happening, but I'm enjoying work and Benjamin's enjoying school, so I'm pretty happy :)\nstudent: I'm happy for you\nteacher: I know you've been working on some present perfect (+ continuous) exercises, so I thought we could practise them a bit\nteacher: Thank you :)\nstudent: Is it the right expression?\nteacher: Yes, definitely!\nstudent: Sure, we can )\nteacher: So we've got 'since ' and 'for' with perfect tenses\nteacher: since + a moment in time\nteacher: for + a period of time\nteacher: since March\nteacher: for 7 months\nteacher: you know that :)\nstudent: Thank you for the revision\nstudent: I really need it all the time ))\nteacher: No worries) Yes, that's how we learn!\nstudent: *revision\nteacher: revision\nstudent: *revision )\nstudent: Yes!!!! ))))\nstudent: revision )\nteacher: How about we each write down three hobbies / activities/ things we've been doing and ask each how long we have been doing them. I'll start\nstudent: Ok!\nteacher: yoga. Can you ask me, 'How long __ ___ ___ ___ yoga?' (the verb is do)\nstudent: How long have you been doing yoga?\nstudent: the yoga?\nstudent: your yoga? )\nteacher: Ok, but continuous would be a bit more natural here\nteacher: do yoga, just yoga)\nstudent: Ah, that's why I need 4 words )\nteacher: yes!\nstudent: And I've started thinking about the article )\nstudent: Ok! So\nteacher: The continuous tense really stresses this 'how long' aspect of the question. Something has been going on for a long time!\nstudent: How long have you been doing yoga?\nteacher: No worries :)\nteacher: Yes, correct, thank you! I've been doing yoga for nearly 7 years now\nteacher: Your turn, please :)\nteacher: I mean, any activity / hobby I can ask a question about)\nstudent: Ok!\nstudent: To be a mum )\nteacher: Ah, good one!\nteacher: How long have you been a mum for?\nstudent: I've been a mum for three or four years )\nstudent: It depends if we count the pregnancy or not )\nteacher: Sure! We can't really use a continuous here, right?\nteacher: I think we should count pregnancy))\nstudent: And why can't we?\nteacher: because 'be' can't be used in a continuous tense in the same way\nteacher: You've been running a business for X years. But: You've been the director of a business for X years\nstudent: And when can we use be in continuous?\nteacher: run = can be used in continuous; be (a director) = not used in continuous\nstudent: Or we can't ever?\nteacher: We don't really! 'Be' is one of the verbs we don't use in continuous tenses\nstudent: Ah! Ok!\nteacher: Ok! my example\nteacher: garden (as a verb)\nstudent: Sure\nteacher: Are you thinking about the question? It's so hard to know in this chat!\nstudent: Yes\nstudent: Sorry\nstudent: One moment\nteacher: no problem\nstudent: How long have you had your garden?\nstudent: Ah\nstudent: Or How long have you been gardening?\nteacher: Yes! Both correct :)\nteacher: I've been gardening for 3 years now. And I've had my garden for 3 years\nstudent: Super )\nstudent: Actually I've been gardening since this summer\nteacher: Does it all make sense? This use of perfect tenses\nteacher: Oh really? I didn't know you had a garden!\nstudent: I have a microgreen rug at my flat )\nteacher: Ah wonderful! Indoor gardening!\nteacher: Which microgreens have you been growing?\nstudent: A tiny garden )\nstudent: Now it's onions\nteacher: a tiny garden is still a garden!\nteacher: lovely!\nstudent: But before it was sunflowers\nstudent: And something else\nstudent: Actually It wasn't my idea\nteacher: My sunflower microgreen has sprouted! You were right, I just had to wait\nstudent: Nice!\nteacher: But waiting is not one of my strenghts :)\nstudent: hahaha\nstudent: Actually same story with the onions\nstudent: But I like the taste\nteacher: Yes, microgreens do have a really intense taste!\nstudent: It's not as strong as a usual onion\nstudent: But it's still an onion )\nteacher: ah, it's not as strong as the usual onion?\nstudent: sure\nstudent: not as strong as\nteacher: Interesting! Maybe it's the other way around with onions, microgreens are less intense than the mature vegetables\nstudent: other way around?\nstudent: Like naoborot in Russian?\nteacher: Correct!\nteacher: :)\nstudent: I like the expression\nteacher: Oh, I've got two expressions with since and for for you\nteacher: As a bonus :)\nstudent: 6 words instead of 1 in Russian )\nteacher: because you've been such a good student :)))\nstudent: hahaha\nteacher: You can also say 'vice versa'\nteacher: a bit of Latin never hurts\nteacher: \u02ccva\u026as \u02c8v\u025c\u02d0.s\u0259\nstudent: It's vice versa with onions?\nstudent: I like Latin ) Per aspera ad astra )))\nteacher: that's it! I bet you studied Latin at law school?\nteacher: Hmm, it's more like, 'When we go away, our neighbours look after our guinea pigs, and vice versa'\nstudent: Yes, I studied it but not for a long time\nteacher: vice versa' = when they go away, we look after their guinea pigs\nteacher: they also have guinea pigs)\nteacher: It's also 'naoborot', but used a bit differently\nstudent: Oh, no! They are so popular there in the UK )\nstudent: *they\nteacher: Hmm, we got them because of our neighbours, to be honest\nstudent: Ok, so I have a sentence and then I add and vice versa\nteacher: We've been looking after their piggies and fell in love with them :)\nstudent: Such a romantic story )\nteacher: And then our neighbours' friend was giving away her guinea pigs and we adopted them\nteacher: That's it, it's a love story :))))\nteacher: Yes, correct about vice versa!\nstudent: Give away?\nteacher: Yes, they didn't want them anymore and were giving them away (for free)\nstudent: otdat'or vybrosit'?\nteacher: give away something vs. sell someting\nteacher: hmm, otdat' :)\nstudent: Ah! Ok )\nstudent: thank you\nteacher: Anyway, your bonus!!\nstudent: I'm ready\nteacher: It's been ages since (I did something)\nteacher: It's been ages since I last went to a cinema!\nstudent: It's been ages since I last went abroad\nteacher: (it wasn't really years, only a few months, but 'ages' just stresses that it was really long)\nteacher: Yes, good!\nteacher: Another one!\nteacher: I haven't done something for ages!\nteacher: I haven't been to the cinema for ages!\nstudent: I haven't eaten chupa chups for ages )))\nstudent: *for\nteacher: Covid provides so many opportunities to practise this, haha\nteacher: Haha, would you like to?\nstudent: haha\nteacher: I haven't been out with friends for ages!\nteacher: It's been ages since I last went to a mall\nteacher: and so on :)))\nstudent: Actually I used to like it before\nstudent: But now.. I'm not sure\nteacher: chupa chups? I liked it when I was very young!\nstudent: Me too )\nteacher: And one more quick exercise!\nstudent: But I don't buy it for Liam\nstudent: Maybe I should do\nteacher: Present Perfect Continous to explain reasons for things in the present\nstudent: Ok!\nteacher: No, because you don't want to pay the dentist)))\nstudent: haha\nteacher: He must be ill, he hasn't been eating!\nteacher: First we say what we see (he must be ill), then we say why we think so\nstudent: Ok!\nteacher: She is so angry! Her son has been missing school and she had no idea\nstudent: I'm hungry, I haven't had my lunch\nteacher: Yes, correct!\nteacher: I'll let you go have lunch in a minute :)\nstudent: ok ))\nteacher: Can you finish these sentences?\nstudent: It wasn't a hint )\nteacher: I know))\nteacher: Her make-up is all smudged because ...\nstudent: smudged\nstudent: like after the rain?\nteacher: Oh sorry, yes! or if you do your make-up and then rub on it\nteacher: or something like that\nteacher: Sometimes we smudge make-up on purpose. For example, my eyeliner has two parts, the actual pencil and a smudger, so that the line is not so strong\nstudent: Her make-up is all smudged because she's been crying for two hours\nteacher: Yes! Very good!\nteacher: Next one!\nteacher: The police are arresting the head of the bank because...\nstudent: she's been paying for her new house from the bank account\nteacher: Well done! I like that the head of the bank is 'she')) most people would say 'he')))\nteacher: Oh, if you buy a house but only pay part of the sum and then pay little bits every month for years\nteacher: like us))\nteacher: it's called 'a mortgage'\nteacher: \u02c8m\u0254\u02d0.\u0261\u026ad\u0292\nstudent: thank you\nteacher: I don't know if this is what you meant ))\nstudent: no\nteacher: ah, sorry! well, you have a new word then\nstudent: I meant that she used bank money\nstudent: Not her own\nteacher: Yes, I got that! She used the bank money to pay her mortgage, right?\nteacher: I just saw an opportunity for a new word))\nstudent: yes! Even not a mortgage\nstudent: Just to pay for the house )\nteacher: Aha, I know what made me think it was a mortgage!\nteacher: The continuous!\nstudent: Aaah\nteacher: she has paid for her house (the full sum) vs. she has been paying for her house (in bits)\nstudent: clear\nstudent: So here maybe it's better to use just Present Perfect\nteacher: Ah, I've got to let you go! Great work today on the perfect tenses!\nteacher: Yes, if you mean she paid it all in one go!\nstudent: Thank you\nstudent: See you on Friday then )\nteacher: Yes, until Friday!

    "teacher: Hi Emily!\nstudent: Hello, Mr. Jackson\nteacher: How are you today?\nstudent: Today I'm a little busy at the company\nteacher: Oh, was it a busy day at work?\nstudent: Yes. Some projects need to be online.\nteacher: I see!\nteacher: It's actually quite late in the evening for you, isn't it?\nteacher: now I mean\nstudent: Yes. I just got home several minutes ago.\nteacher: Oh no! You only got home several minutes ago? You must be exhausted!\nstudent: But I did the exam yesterday.\nteacher: Still, I appreciate your dedication!\nteacher: Good! Have you got any questions about it? How did it go?\nstudent: Except for a few parts I'm not familiar with, others are fine for me.\nteacher: Ok, before we go into it, 'I have done the exam yesterday' Can you spot a mistake (grammar)?\nstudent: I have done the exam. or I did the exam yesterday.\nteacher: Perfect, thank you, good correction :)\nteacher: Which parts of the exam were more difficult?\nstudent: I'm not familiar with questions like part 3.\nstudent: Sorry, part 4\nstudent: part 3 is OK\nteacher: Ah, I'm with you. Part 4 is probably the most difficult but you will get used to it, I'm sure!\nteacher: Were there any particular questions that you would like me to talk about maybe?\nstudent: Actually when I saw the answer I thought it was not so difficult, but I just couldn't do it right before.\nstudent: I thought\nteacher: I see, so the answers make sense to you, this is good! You'll get your head around this format with some practice in no time I'm sure\nstudent: like Q28 and Q30\nteacher: I'm just having a look. Q30 is about the phrasal verb. cancel = call off\nteacher: What's the answer in Q28 actually? I spent a long time knocking on Ruth's door?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Ah yes, it makes sense!\nstudent: And part 5 and part 6 I think are good for me.\nteacher: I've looked into B2 preparation books. I would say, an FCE book will work well, but the newer the edition the better. It looks like they have revised a lot of old FCE books for B2. It's good to have a new book because it will reflect the slight changes in the exam\nstudent: OK. I will pick a newer one.\nteacher: But if you can for example borrow an older FCE book from a library instead of paying for a newer book, that will still be excellent preparation\nteacher: I do understand that newer books are more expensive\nstudent: So when you were in China, were in you at XDF school?\nteacher: You can prepare very well with an older book\nteacher: What's XDF school?\nstudent: Actually the price is OK for me. I like buying books.\nteacher: Ok, I remember :)\nteacher: I like __ buy books\nstudent: I like to buy books.\nteacher: yes, or I like buying books, equally correct)\nstudent: XDF is a famous language shool in China.\nteacher: I didn't actually work in China. My husband was an IELTS examiner with the British Council there, but we had a newborn baby, so I stayed at home\nteacher: Ah, I see!\nstudent: OK. I know.\nteacher: Out of curiosity, do mothers get a long maternity leave in China? and do fathers get any paternity leave?\nstudent: Sorry, I can\u2019t understand the meaning of the sentence.\nstudent: the meaning of the sentence\nteacher: Oh sorry! A maternity leave is some paid time off work that a mother can have before her baby is born and after that\nteacher: For example, in the UK I think a woman can have a couple of weeks before her baby is due and 6 months after that. She gets the full pay during this time\nteacher: And a father can take 2 weeks off, also with full pay\nteacher: for a mother, this is called a maternity leave\nteacher: for a father, a paternity leave\nstudent: I know. In China a mother has 3 months, a father has 2 weeks.\nstudent: The UK is a great country!\nteacher: I see! What about a pension? What's the retirement age? Retirement age = the age when a person can stop working and receive some pension money\nteacher: So is China! :) 3 months or 6 months - this is not enough for a baby and a mother, but this is only my opinion, obviously\nstudent: Pension is good for a worker, but it is not good for a farmer.\nteacher: Ok, interesting!\nteacher: How does it work then?\nstudent: And public servants can retire at 60 now.\nteacher: I see! 68 in the UK!!\nstudent: I think 68 is ok\nteacher: Workers, farmers, public servants. You can keep them all in the plural (S at the end) and go without articles\nteacher: the workers - only some workers that we're talking about\nteacher: workers = all workers in the country\nteacher: Workers can retire with a good pension. (all workers in the country, workers in general)\nteacher: but\nteacher: The workers in this company = only some workers, the ones in this company\nteacher: Does it make sense?\nstudent: Workers who work in companies which belong to the government will get a good pension.\nteacher: I see! This is very interesting! But if they work in private companies, it's a different story?\nstudent: Workers who work in private companies can earn more money, but cannot get a good pension.\nteacher: That's quite a dilemma, isn't it?\nteacher: state company vs. private company\nstudent: And also their work will be very hard.\nteacher: Well, state company sounds wrong. but 'state schools, state hospitals etc.' is good\nteacher: we can say a 'government-owned company'\nteacher: What do you mean, 'their work will be very tired'?\nstudent: In private companies, the working hours will be very long, and there is often overtime.\nstudent: Like me, we go to work at 9:00 am and go home at 9:00 PM.\nteacher: Ok, this is much better, thank you! Workers often do/ work overtime\nteacher: The workers at a company are often called 'employees'\nteacher: an employee - employees\nstudent: Yes, thanks.\nteacher: The stress is on 'ee'   employEE\nstudent: and the boss is an employer.\nteacher: Correct :)\nteacher: I think the best way to talk about non-private companies would be 'companies in the public sector'\nteacher: like military, police, public healthcare\nstudent: OK\nteacher: everything that is paid for by taxpayers, right?\nteacher: public sector vs. private sector\nstudent: Yes.\nstudent: Does the UK have some of the social problems that China has?\nstudent: Does\nteacher: Ok, could you write a small text, maybe 4-5 sentences, about working in the public sector vs. private sector in China (working hours, pay, pension). Using the words like employee, public, private, retire, work overtime). Just to put it all together\nteacher: Good question! While you're writing that, I'll write about the UK :)\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: Feel free to post when you are ready\nstudent: In China there is a lot of difference between working in the public sector and the private sector. First, when people work in the private sector, they have long working hours. And also they get paid well. But people who work in the public sector have relatively normal working hours and they do not get paid as much. Secondly, people who work in the public sector or private sector may have an inverse treatment regarding pension. So it's a difficult to select a company to work for in China.\nstudent: It's a question to ...\nteacher: Thank you, great! Some things for us to work on, but your ideas are clear\nteacher: I would say, 'it's important to choose a company to work for well'\nteacher: it's important to make an informed choice about a place to work\nstudent: OK\nteacher: make an informed choice = collect information and think about it before making a choice\nteacher: I will copy your text and we can work on it a bit more next time.\nteacher: This is what I wrote\nstudent: OK! Thanks\nteacher: So,  yes, of course, the UK has lots of social problems, some of them similar to the ones in China and some quite different. It\u2019s the same idea with having a good pension for employees in the public sector. Some of them are very well-paid like doctors and others are underpaid and overworked like nurses, teachers and firefighters. A huge number of people work in the private sector, and they can still receive a state pension as long as they pay their taxes and also a pension from their company. I think the working hours are a bit more regulated. Employers understand that they need to keep employees happy. If employees are always exhausted, they will soon burn out and leave. Some other social problems include poverty and the new problem that is access to healthcare. British healthcare system is excellent and free for everyone (paid through taxes), but it has been underfunded for a while and is getting overwhelmed at the moment.\nstudent: Thanks. The most important part is great, the healthcare system.\nteacher: Yes, it's very good! The one in China is very good too I think and free for people, right?\nstudent: Actually not as good as this.\nstudent: Maybe next time we can talk about it.\nteacher: Ok, it would be interesting to talk about it next time, yes!\nstudent: Thanks a lot!\nteacher: Have a lovely weekend, I'll talk to you on Monday!\nteacher: You're very welcome, bye!\nstudent: By the way, if I send you an email with some questions, is it ok for you?",
    "student: Hi, Ms. Rodriguez!\nstudent: How are you?\nteacher: Hi Emily!\nteacher: All good, thank you. And you?\nstudent: Fine, Thank you\nstudent: Yesterday my back hurt again, but today it seems better\nteacher: Have you had a good week?\nstudent: And I've done my yoga\nteacher: Oh no, not again! I thought it was getting better!\nteacher: *I\nstudent: Oh, it's a good question ))))\nteacher: Did the doctor say it was to do with you lifting Sophia?\nstudent: I think I've had a good week, but you know, these are strange times now\nstudent: On the one hand, you think that it's OK if nothing has happened\nteacher: Definitely! We've had a good week too, only leaving the house to take Ethan to school and pick him up again\nstudent: On the other, you think that before there were more possibilities etc )\nteacher: which is not what we're used to!\nteacher: I know what you mean!\nteacher: The expressions are 'on the one hand' and 'on the other hand'\nstudent: Sure!!\nteacher: On the hand, we're all safe and healthy for now\nstudent: I meant this one )\nstudent: *I\nteacher: On the other hand, we're very limited in what we can do!\nstudent: Agree\nstudent: About the doctor\nteacher: Sorry 'on the one hand'!\nteacher: yes, go on\nstudent: Yes, maybe my back has been hurting because of lifting Sophia\nstudent: And yesterday we went to the park\nstudent: It's about 30 mins from our new flat\nteacher: Ah, good Present Perfect Continuous, but one tiny thing is missing! 'my back has been hurt...'\nstudent: Usually I try to go to the park during the working week because there aren't many people there\nteacher: Mariinsky?\nstudent: Yes, Mariinsky\nteacher: Definitely, on week days!\nteacher: Nice!\nstudent: we have another good park nearby, but Sophia has decided to go to Park Slavy with the nanny\nstudent: *Sophia\nstudent: And with us she prefers to go to Mariinsky )))\nteacher: It's nice to have a choice :)\nstudent: on week days! I meant this expression )\nteacher: yes, on week days vs at the weekend :)\nstudent: I don't feel comfortable there even on week days\nteacher: Is it quite busy?\nstudent: Because we still have lots of people who let their children play with others\nstudent: But I prefer not to have any contact with people\nteacher: Oh, I see! That's a problem!\nstudent: Yes//\nstudent: OK!\nstudent: About your question\nstudent: Ah, good Present Perfect Continuous, but one tiny thing is missing! 'my back has been hurt...'\nteacher: You know what, let's dive into our writing exercise, because I've prepared something I hope you will find interesting for later and want to save some time for that\nstudent: Let me think )\nteacher: Yes, go on!\nstudent: has been hurting\nstudent: been\nstudent: ?\nteacher: Correct! :)\nteacher: Yes!\nteacher: excellent use though :)\nstudent: )\nstudent: And let's dive into the exercise )\nteacher: Ok, as Zuma says in Paw Patrol, let's dive in! :))\nstudent: haha\nstudent: Zuma is our favorite\nstudent: You know )\nteacher: Mine too! But Ethan likes Sky and Chase\nteacher: Oh, because he wears orange?\nstudent: Sophia likes Zuma because he wears orange\nteacher: Yep, makes perfect sense :))\nstudent: I mean orange clothes )\nteacher: Ok, this is our old text\nteacher: Dear Ms. Rodriguez,  Thank you for your question. We completely understand you, and let me assure you that our teaching method is all about communication - it's the communicative method. All our teachers use it to help students communicate easily. On our lesson you will speak a lot and to learn some words and expressions which are really very useful in your usual life here in Ukraine At the same time you will learn some grammar basics and letters, but we are sure that it will be fun because of our method of teaching and our experienced teachers\nstudent: And one more thing\nstudent: Sorry\nteacher: Yes, sure!\nstudent: I have to tell you\nteacher: Please :)\nstudent: Why do they never use Zuma for clothing prints?!!!\nstudent: Chase, the yellow one and Marshall\nteacher: It's always Sky or Chase, right??\nstudent: Sometimes Sky\nteacher: I know, Zuma's so cool!\nstudent: I hate it )\nteacher: I see why! We've got a toy Zuma but it was hard to find it!\nstudent: I mean that they don't use Zuma prints )\nteacher: Have you managed to buy an advent calendar?\nstudent: It's not such a big problem with toys, but with clothes or duvets, for example\nstudent: no!!!\nstudent: But Natalie has read some reviews from Amazon\nstudent: And lots of people don't like it\nteacher: oh, the advent calendar?\nteacher: Hmm\nstudent: Because it is too cheap and the quality isn't high\nteacher: Are there any in Ukraine? Now that Christmas is on the 25th of December, there should be some!\nstudent: So maybe we will think about a LOL advent calendar\nteacher: what's LOL?\nstudent: I don't like LOLs, but the calendar looks great\nstudent: LOL! Oh! You are happy if you don't know\nstudent: )))\nteacher: Haha)) doesn't sound good!\nstudent: lolsurprise.com\nteacher: Aah, yes, I was happily unaware of that!\nstudent: But the advent calendar is nice\nteacher: That's something then!\nstudent: A doll with some clothes\nteacher: I see!\nstudent: sorry\nstudent: I have a call\nteacher: No worries\nstudent: one moment\nstudent: I'm here\nstudent: I'm very sorry\nstudent: sorry\nteacher: No worries, it happens! you have to take urgents calls :)\nstudent: Ready for the exercises )\nteacher: this is our old text\nteacher: Dear Ms. Rodriguez,  Thank you for your question. We completely understand you, and let me assure you that our teaching method is all about communication - it's the communicative method. All our teachers use it to help students communicate easily. On our lesson you will speak a lot and to learn some words and expressions which are really very useful in your usual life here in Ukraine At the same time you will learn some grammar basics and letters, but we are sure that it will be fun because of our method of teaching and our experienced teachers\nstudent: Ok!\nteacher: Ooops, sorry, it's not the original version, I added the corrections we made last time, actually\nteacher: as you can see\nstudent: I see )\nteacher: let me assure you that...'\nstudent: Yes\nstudent: I remember the word\nteacher: But that's not a problem! Let's start with sentence 4 then\nteacher: First thing, I would go for 'during lessons'\nteacher: or 'in the lessons'\nstudent: Sure!\nstudent: During lessons\nstudent: I don't need an article?\nteacher: you will speak a lot and to learn some words' Can you find a word that shouldn't be here?\nstudent: to! I don't need to\nteacher: No, no article is fine because we're not talking about some concrete lessons\nteacher: lessons in general\nteacher: Correct!\nteacher: usual life': I think you mean 'everyday life'\nstudent: Ok! And in the lessons I need the?\nteacher: that would be a good expression\nstudent: Yes, I mean everyday life\nstudent: So\nteacher: Good question about 'in the lessons'! I intuitively want 'the' there. I think because it sounds like a place, and we usually use 'the' with places (at the hospital / supermarket, in the street)\nstudent: During lessons you will speak a lot and learn some words and expressions which are really very useful in your everyday life here in Ukraine\nstudent: Ah! More like a place! Ok!\nteacher: Yes, that sounds good!\nteacher: I would just go with 'really useful'\nteacher: but good!\nteacher: And the last sentence is absolutely fine :)\nstudent: Ah, really useful Ok!\nstudent: Thank you\nteacher: Lovely!\nteacher: Ok, something new for today, and something to do with your favourite English person!\nstudent: you? )\nteacher: Who do you think I mean?)\nteacher: Aww, thank you! I'm Ukrainian though!))\nstudent: )))\nteacher: So it can't be me!\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: it's a famous person\nstudent: The Queen, James Bond, Mr Bean?\nstudent: )\nstudent: Santa? )\nteacher: Got it! The Queen!\nteacher: Santa, haha))\nstudent: He is not English )\nstudent: ok )\nteacher: No, it can't be Santa\nteacher: This is the situation when we don't know exactly and we have to guess (well, you have to guess, I know my person)\nstudent: ok )\nteacher: And when we're guessing, we are very sure that some things are not true\nteacher: like Santa, he is not English\nteacher: we are sure it's not true\nteacher: it CAN'T be Santa\nteacher: or me)\nteacher: But it COULD be James Bond\nteacher: or it MIGHT be the Queen\nstudent: ok!\nteacher: or it MAY BE Mr Bean\nteacher: they are all good options, but we are not sure: could / might / may\nstudent: or it must be the Queen if we are talking about someone very British )\nteacher: Yes, if we're very sure, we say, Ah, I know! It MUST be the Queen!\nteacher: MUST = very very sure\nteacher: CAN'T = sure that it's not\nstudent: ah OK!\nteacher: MUST = sure that it is\nteacher: could / might  / may = in the middle\nteacher: not very sure\nteacher: As you can see, they're followed by an infinitive\nteacher: It could be the Queen\nstudent: ok!\nteacher: And they are called 'modals of deduction' in grammar\nteacher: Deduction, as the method that Sherlock Holmes used\nstudent: sure!\nteacher: when he didn't know for sure, but had some information to work with))\nstudent: yes!\nteacher: I'll give you some exercises for modals of deduction as homework, but I'm sure we can practising straightaway\nstudent: and what about should?\nteacher: Good question! Should is more like 'have to'\nteacher: For example, the Queen should veto stupid things that the government comes up with\nteacher: should = she has to\nstudent: Ok, no should for deduction?\nteacher: (she never does, by the way)\nteacher: No, should is not for deduction!\nstudent: the Queen you mean?\nteacher: It's more for, I should eat less cake))\nteacher: No, she never vetoes anything!\nstudent: I should eat cake! )\nteacher: Oh, I agree! I might bake a cake this weekend\nstudent: Ah, I see, Yes!\nteacher: I might = I haven't decided yet, maybe yes, maybe no\nstudent: She is a symbol )\nteacher: Oh yes, she is not a political force!\nteacher: Anyway, I found an interesting interview with a man who worked at Buckingham palace as one of the Queen's chefs\nstudent: super!\nstudent: The Queen and food\nteacher: That's it!\nstudent: What can be better?\nteacher: He writes about what she eats regularly\nteacher: haha, food!\nstudent: I mean the Queen + food\nstudent: It's a good mix )\nteacher: What do you think she might eat? Considering she is one of the richest people in the world! A good opportunity to use: She might / could / may like ... etc.\nstudent: ok\nteacher: Ah, yes, got you!\nteacher: *one of the richest women in the world, not people\nstudent: She might like tea ))\nstudent: haha\nstudent: I like my joke )))\nstudent: About stereotypes\nstudent: Ok\nstudent: one more\nteacher: There's a possibility!\nstudent: She may like porridge ))))\nteacher: But, if we're pretty sure, we can say, 'she __ like tea!'\nstudent: Sorry )\nstudent: She must like tea )\nteacher: That's it! Great!\nstudent: She must like porridge )\nteacher: Modal verbs are great for expressing these things!\nteacher: Do you think she eats English food or tries things from different places in the world?\nstudent: She must like some traditional British food like puddings or stew\nteacher: Ah, good sentence, excellent student! :)))\nstudent: )\nstudent: She may like something not very traditional\nstudent: Let me think\nstudent: hm\nstudent: Maybe borchsh? )\nteacher: Haha, you never know, she may like borshch!!\nteacher: Goodness, I can't spell it\nteacher: borchsh?\nteacher: shch\nteacher: chsh\nteacher: ???\nstudent: Ah! Borshch )\nteacher: Thank you)\nteacher: Maybe Olia Hercules can convert her))\nstudent: ))\nstudent: haha\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: Ok, a few words that will help you read the story later\nteacher: All good guesses about the Queen!\nstudent: She might like some cakes I think\nteacher: HRH = Her Royal Highness\nstudent: ok!\nteacher: which is a proper way to talk about the Queen)))\nteacher: Yes, she might like sweet things! Or alternatively, she might be more into savoury stuff\nteacher: savoury (adj.) is a way to describe the taste of things like sausages, bacon, good soup...\nstudent: I like it\nstudent: Cheese biscuits\nstudent: My mum bakes goon ones\nteacher: something salty and spicy\nstudent: good\nteacher: and not sweet\nstudent: ok!\nteacher: Yes, you prefer savoury to sweet, if I remember correctly :)\nstudent: yes, but now I need some sweets )\nstudent: haha\nteacher: Ok! Tupperware = a brand of plastic containers\nstudent: ok! I see\nteacher: I've always preferred sweets))\nstudent: Now I'm with you )))\nteacher: a carbohydrate\nstudent: soda? )\nteacher: One of the three nutrients in food. Fats, proteins and carbohydrates\nteacher: Mmm, no, not soda\nstudent: Ah!\nstudent: ok!\nteacher: carbohydrates = sugar, pasta, biscuits\nstudent: I like carbohydrates )\nstudent: My favorites\nteacher: Yes! They give us energy!\nstudent: kasha )\nstudent: buns )\nteacher: Oh, if you do get Netflix, you should watch 'Salt Fat Acid Heat'\nteacher: All the food, mmm!\nteacher: Yes, definitely!\nteacher: Ok, I'll leave you with these words. Let me send you the homework links\nstudent: Ok!\nteacher: Actually, I'll send them to you in Messenger because you know how this chat is with links\nstudent: Thank you!\nteacher: a bit rubbish\nstudent: Sure! Thank you very much\nstudent: Have a good weekend!\nteacher: I was surprised about what the Queen eats, so I hope you'll enjoy the text!\nstudent: Bye )\nteacher: You too, have a lovely weekend, thank you!\nteacher: Bye!\nstudent: Sure! )",
    "teacher: Hi Sophia!\nteacher: I'm so sorry, my laptop's being rubbish today!\nteacher: or maybe my Internet connection\nstudent: Hello, nice to speak to you again!\nteacher: It took me a while to log on\nstudent: It's OK.\nteacher: Nice to talk to you again, yes\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: I'm fine. My application for a research assistant is still being processed.\nteacher: Oh, is it still being processed? That must be very stressful for you!\nstudent: Yes. My professor helped me contact the manager who is in charge of these things.\nteacher: Oh, that's good! Hopefully, it'll help\nstudent: Thanks, I also think it should work. Or maybe I can get a result, whether bad or good.\nteacher: Is your contract in Beijing running out? Or can you stay for as long as you want?\nteacher: Yes, uncertaintly is the worst. You need to know either way\nstudent: I can stay in Beijing as long as I want.\nteacher: I see, at least that's good!\nteacher: Are you from Beijing?\nstudent: My hometown is near Beijing.\nteacher: Ok, I see!\nteacher: Do you like living in Beijing?\nstudent: Not so much, haha\nteacher: No? Why not?\nstudent: Beijing is not a good city to live in, because the price of houses is too high.\nteacher: Oh I see! I can imagine! It's the same in Shanghai, unfortunately. The rent is very expensive\nteacher: It's a very common B2 speaking question, by the way. What do you like / dislike about the place where you live\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: Is there anything you like about Beijing?\nstudent: Yes. Since Beijing is the capital of China, it has lots of cultural resource.\nteacher: Ok, like what for example?\nstudent: There are a lot of live shows in Beijing, like singing shows, talk shows etc.\nstudent: A lot of famous artists also have exhibitions.\nteacher: Ah, there are live shows\nteacher: Just 'live', you don't need house\nteacher: Yes, I bet it's a very interesting place to live!\nteacher: Do you think Shanghai will be different?\nstudent: OK. In China people always say live house, I don't know why.\nstudent: Yes. I think Shanghai is not the same.\nteacher: Hmm, 'watch something live on Broadway' or 'my favourite singer is performing live'\nteacher: In what way is Shanghai different?\nstudent: Shanghai is more international than Beijing.\nteacher: Ok, interesting!\nteacher: Anything else?\nstudent: The climate in Shanghai is better.\nteacher: Ok, in what way?\nstudent: I mean the temperature and humidity\nteacher: Oh, you mean the climate?\nteacher: Yes, Beijing is much colder, isn't it?\nstudent: Shanghai is warmer than Beijing in winter.\nteacher: But Shanghai has a very long rain season\nstudent: Yes. But I think it's better than the long dry season in Beijing.\nteacher: You're probably right!\nteacher: Let's have a look at your writing from the last time, ok?\nstudent: But I know in Shanghai, there are more bugs than in Beijing. Haha\nteacher: Yes, because it's so tropical! Huge flying monsters!!\nteacher: I  must admit I did not enjoy that aspect of Shanghai\nteacher: In China peple works in the public sector or private soctor have a lot difference. Firstly, when people work in private sector, they have a long working hours. And also they will get good paid. But people who work in public sector will have a relative normal working hours, and also get paid not so much. Secondly, people works in the public sector or private secoter may have inverse treatment in pension. So it;s a question the select company in China.\nteacher: In China people works in the public sector or private soctor have a lot difference.\nteacher: Ok, first sentence\nteacher: Are you happy with this sentence? Maybe you can see something that needs fixing?\nstudent: In China there is a lot of difference between working in the public and private sector.\nstudent: Sorry, this is also not good.\nteacher: Aha, interesting! I think you realized that you need to split this sentence into two clauses. A clause = a part of a sentence with its own subject and verb\nteacher: I would suggest, 'In China people who work in the public and private sector...\nstudent: Yes\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: who work in the public and private sector is a clause inside a bigger sentence\nteacher: have a lot of difference = not really a phrase\nteacher: We say 'there is a lot of difference'\nteacher: Could you change the sentence starting with 'In China there is a lot of difference between...\nstudent: In China there is a lot of difference between people who work in the public and private sectors.\nteacher: Yes! Well done!!\nteacher: next sentence\nteacher: Firstly, when people work in private sector, they have a long working hours\nstudent: My teacher in China always told us not to use 'there be' structure all the time.\nteacher: Well, don't use it all the time, but it's a very useful structure to say that some things exist\nteacher: There are many big cities in China\nstudent: OK. I know now.\nteacher: There is a lot of difference between...\nteacher: So maybe not always, but it's a very good structure :)\nteacher: Firstly, when people work in private sector, they have a long working hours\nteacher: This is a very good sentence! But there's a bit of a problem with articles\nteacher: Firstly, when people work in __ private sector, they have __ long working hours\nteacher: sector = singular noun (1 sector), so you need an article\nteacher: hours = plural noun, you can't use 'a' in the plural\nstudent: Yes.\nteacher: Ok, what goes in the gaps then? in __ private sector\nstudent: a\nstudent: in a private sector\nteacher: Yes, good!\nteacher: they have __ long working hours\nteacher: No article at all here, ok?\nstudent: yes. Have long working hours\nteacher: Yes, sure. Next one!\nteacher: And also they will get good paid\nteacher: The expression is 'get paid well'\nteacher: or 'they are well-paid\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: good = adjective, it works with a noun. I'm having a good day. A good dog etc.\nteacher: well = adverb, it works with a verb. pay = verb, so you need\nteacher: well\nteacher: not good\nteacher: Adverbs also work with adjectives\nstudent: OK. I can understand the difference between adj and adv. Thanks.\nteacher: For example, in the next sentence you say, 'relative normal working hours'\nstudent: difference between\nteacher: normal = adjective\nteacher: so you need an adverb to work with it\nteacher: could you change 'relative' into an adverb?\nstudent: relatively?\nteacher: Yes, absolutely!\nteacher: relatively normal working hours = very good expression, well done!\nteacher: people works in the public sector or private secter may have inverse treatment in pension\nteacher: Ok, could you change this sentence the way we did the first sentence?\nstudent: There will be an inverse treatment in pension for people who work in the public and private sectors.\nteacher: Well done!! This is much better, thank you!\nteacher: There will be, or just there is\nteacher: Finally, the last sentence\nteacher: So it;s a question the select company in China.\nteacher: I would say, 'it's a challenge to select a company in China'\nteacher: as in, it's difficult\nteacher: or just 'it's difficult to select...'\nteacher: It doesn't really work with 'question', I'm afraid\nstudent: Yes.\nteacher: or 'it's important to think about these factors when you select a company in China'\nteacher: a company' = noun, singular, a\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: Ok, a quick question: when do you think you would like to take the B2 exam? If it's ok for me to ask\nstudent: I don't know the schedule of the B2 exam. But if it's ok, I think I need three months to prepare.\nstudent: Is it OK?\nteacher: Ok, thank you. I think, depending on your reading and use of English results, you would need a good 6-12 months to get your writing to the right level. It's clear from your writing what you want to say, but there are quite a few mistakes for now and a lot of things to work on.\nteacher: And it would be nice to learn and start to use more words and expressions\nstudent: OK. Thank you for you advice.\nteacher: I hope this is not discouraging. I think you're working hard, and it will definitely pay off! Just keep at it for now :)\nteacher: I emailed you a bit of extra homework.\nteacher: Anyway, I've got to let you go. Speak to you on Thursday, all the best!\nstudent: I think you advice is great, I like peole who also correct my mistakes.\nstudent: Bye. Thanks again.\nteacher: Bye :)\nteacher: good use of 'who...'! :)",
    "student: Hi Miss Garcia! How are you?\nteacher: Hi Sophia! I'm good, thank you!\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: Fine thank you!\nteacher: How are you coping with working from home, the curfew and all that?\nstudent: From today there is a lockdown...even though we can go out for walks and babysitters are still allowed...so, I would say fine.\nstudent: The only part I really don't like is the fact that I don't know when I'll be able to go back to Italy...\nteacher: Oh really? They've tightened the measures then?\nstudent: I guess that will be no earlier than next year; and you? How is the situation in Cambridgeshire?\nstudent: Yes, now all non-necessary shops are closed, you can't meet with other families (with some exceptions). Currently Austria has the worst situation in Europe, at least from the number of new infections, so it was expected.\nteacher: We're the same, under lockdown, which the PM insists should end on December 2, but scientists are saying that, if it does, the infection rate will just rise again.\nteacher: Oh I see, hope the lockdown will work! Are people generally ready to accept it or are they protesting?\nteacher: Were you hoping to go to Italy for Christmas?\nstudent: Here in Austria it looks like they are mostly accepting...even though someone is complaining...but it is nothing like Italy, where people are marching and infecting each other\nstudent: I wouldn't say I was really hoping to go back for Christmas...but let's say now it really looks like that won't happen.\nteacher: I see! We're lucky of course, being able to work from home. I can't imagine what it's like for the hospitality industry. There's a furlough scheme in place to alleviate the blow to them, but still\nteacher: Yes, I see. We traditionally go to my in-laws in the north of England for Christmas, but that sounds riskier than it's worth at the moment\nstudent: Yes, for hospitals this is a bad situation...especially in places where organization has always been lacking, e.g. most of Italy.\nteacher: Oh, that's a sad situation!\nteacher: I meant 'hospitality' actually, if this is what you're responding to. As in hotels, restaurants etc.\nstudent: Calabria, a southern region of Italy, is now under lockdown even though the numbers are very small...because their hospitals were already in very bad shape before the pandemic...\nstudent: I only hope people will try to fix all these problems, which are well known and have been there for decades...at least once the pandemic gives us some respite\nteacher: I see! You'd think Italy has already suffered enough during this pandemic. I'm sorry to hear it's bad again!\nteacher: And amidst all this, the UK is preparing for Brexit. Or more like, discovering that it's still not prepared for Brexit and failing to negotiate things!\nstudent: I think every country has suffered enough...I am just saying that all my life people have complained that there are some problems in the healthcare, especially in the south of Italy...\nteacher: I see, so the hospitals are very easily overwhelmed, right?\nstudent: but in the end nothing changed...except for some people who were given special powers to fix the healthcare problem in Calabria, for example, and ended up dying in weird ways...\nteacher: Really? Are you saying they might have been murdered?\nstudent: In the south of Italy hospitals are in a really poor condition...or, at least, most of them. The north is another thing (but of course it varies).\nstudent: Yes...at least, the last person who the goverment put in Calabria to change things died of a weird heart attack...and they didn't do an autopsy or run tests for poisons...\nteacher: Yes, it sounds like the north-south divide in Italy is more pronounced than in England!\nstudent: It really is, and I am sorry to say it because I have lived in the south, I have friends from the south...but...Italy has many regional differences\nteacher: That's awful! They died __ a heart attach (what's the preposition?)\nstudent: But in general, the south north divide is great...\nstudent: They died of a heart attack\nteacher: correcgt\nteacher: correct)\nteacher: Yes, it's something people tend to know about Italy, whereas you usually have to live in England to be aware of the north / south divide here\nstudent: By divide you mean a difference in the economy, or also in the mentality, the way people think?\nteacher: Yes, an economic as well as a cultural difference!\nstudent: I see...indeed, I had never heard of such a divide!\nteacher: And quite a significant linguistic difference, for England.\nstudent: Scottish accent and such?\nstudent: My brother went to Edinburgh to do his thesis and said it was a very beautiful and modern city...the main problem was that it was difficult to come by good italian food there.\nteacher: It's more the northern accents, such as Yorkshire, Cheshire, Mancunian and Liverpoodlian\nteacher: That's interesting! I thought there was a big Italian community in Scotland!\nteacher: I actually have a friend who is Scottish Italian\nteacher: *a Scottish Italian\nstudent: Maybe there is, he was there only for six months so I guess he only explored the local supermarkets.\nteacher: I'm guessing you can't make good Italian food without good Italian ingredients and those might be hard to come by!\nstudent: Haha...yes, I guess you are right!\nteacher: I've already bought some Italian tomato seeds for the next summer as the worry is there will be even fewer nice Italian products after Brexit\nteacher: So I'll have to emulate Italy here in Cambridgeshire! Wish me luck!\nstudent: Haha...good luck! I hope the weather will be good enough to make them grow!\nteacher: Did your brother do his thesis at the University of Edinburgh? This is where my husband is doing his master's at the moment :)\nteacher: It's never good enough, but I got a polytunnel too))\nstudent: Yes, he did most of the work needed for the thesis there, and then wrote it here...so I guess it was a collaboration really.\nstudent: Oh, a polytunnel...that's a new word for me. I guess you will have to use it\nteacher: My husband has never been to Edinburgh, it's all online. Which is fitting considering his master's is in digital education. We hope to go to Edinburgh for his graduation, though\nstudent: but then, good luck with the tomatoes!\nstudent: I agree, online graduations are a bit...boring...\nstudent: hopefully he'll graduate after this pandemic is back under control\nteacher: Thank you! Haha, I guess for an Italian a polytunnel is not a thing because there's enough sunshine and warmth! It's like a cheaper version of  greenhouse, but made out of strong plastic rather than glass\nteacher: Yes, hopefully next autumn, which coincidentally is when the scientists are saying life might get back to normal\nstudent: Greenhouses are used in Italy, especially in the north of Italy ;) I guess only the south can really avoid using them.\nstudent: Next autumn is probably a good time to start.\nstudent: sorry...to conclude his studies (given the current situation).\nteacher: I see! I think people in England have this idolized image of Italy, all sunshine every day\nstudent: Haha...no, not really ;)\nstudent: But it is true that in the south there are houses without a heating system...they use small stoves for the few cold days of the year.\nteacher: Hopefully! He's working on his dissertation at the moment, all about how covid has faciliated a leap into digitizing everything\nstudent: Wow, that's an interesting topic! And, I guess, a good choice for the current time.\nteacher: He was originally planning to write about the gradual switch to digital, but it hasn't been gradual this year!\nteacher: To live in a place that doesn't need a heating system! Dream!\nstudent: Nope, not at all! Haha...yes, the south of Italy is a very nice place to live and eat...but it has its downsides...\nteacher: There's always a catch, isn't there\nstudent: Haha...indeed!\nteacher: I'm glad we've moved on to the more pleasant subjects! I'm sorry about starting with a chat about lockdowns! They're too depressing to bring them into classes at the moment\nteacher: Shall we have another look at your book review?\nstudent: Oh, don't worry...it is what we are living nowadays...so we can't just ignore reality.\nstudent: Yes, let's see :)\nteacher: True! And all the new language that comes with it. Like, unless you were a lawyer or an ecomist, no one here knew what 'furlough' was before this March\nteacher: Actually, let me ask, what was your target audience for the book review?\nteacher: *economist. lost a syllable there\nstudent: Which review? The book on physics?\nteacher: Yes, that's right!\nstudent: I guess anyone who was deciding whether or not to read it...so I guess people going to high school\nstudent: or other people interested in 'science' who are not experts\nteacher: oh, what we call pop science?\nstudent: Yes, that is the correct word!\nteacher: Did you publish the review?\nstudent: Yes...it is a website where you can also publish reviews\nstudent: I guess I was writing them also to exercise my English...\nstudent: But I will probably remove them, since they are really...proper reviews...\nteacher: I'm just trying to get a feel of what you intended it for. If it's, for example, an Amazon review or something like that, then the colloquial tone is totally justified, but if you were writing for a newspaper, for example, it was maybe a bit too colloquial\nstudent: (What I mean is that I would now re edit them and it would take too much work)\nstudent: I wouldn't say that these  reviews are as casual as the Amazon ones, but they are still semi-casual.\nteacher: Ok, I'm with you, thank you!\nstudent: ...*and it would...\nteacher: In a few places there, I just thought you could do much better with your proficient English. Find more precise words, for example. So this the direction I want us to go with it\nteacher: I found brilliant h ow the author managed to mix a wide variety of topics, giving often a picture which is quite clear in its foundamentals : from our logical systems, to the possibility of research and understanding, to the limits that the phyisical law  impose us.\nteacher: With this one, could you re-phrase in simple terms what you meant for me, please?\nteacher: starting from 'a picture'\nteacher: the beginning is quite clear :)\nstudent: Haha...I meant...giving a general idea\nstudent: I am not sure why I used a picture, probably comes from some Italian...the idea being he didn't detail all the steps, but described the most important part\nteacher: Aha, so he gave a general idea of the fundamentals of (?)\nstudent: Yes, I guess that would work better!\nteacher: Ok, I'm still not sure about what goes after the colon!\nstudent: he gave a general idea of the fundamentals of different topics: our logical system, limits and possibilities of our ability to understand and our science, limits imposed on us by physical laws.\nteacher: Or shall we get rid of fundamentals? because 'a general idea' implies something fundamental when it comes to science I suppose. What do you think?\nstudent: I guess I should then explain a bit what I mean with each of these topics....\nteacher: Aha, I'm getting a clearer idea now\nstudent: I see...\nstudent: Well, maybe it would be better to get rid of 'fundamentals', or to write something slightly different:\nstudent: he gave a general idea of some of the fundamental ideas in different topics\nteacher: a general idea of the workings of our logical system, the limits and possibilities of understanding science and the limits imposed on us by physical laws\nteacher: just a suggestion\nteacher: Actually, with two 'limits' in one sentence, could you choose a synonym for one of them?\nstudent: Hmm\nteacher: for example, 'constraints'?\nstudent: the limits and possibilities of human understanding and science in general, and the constraints imposed on us by physical laws\nteacher: I like it very much, yes!\nstudent: I was also thinking of 'limitations', but I wouldn't use that as a substitute for 'limit'\nstudent: (I mean, it sounds almost the same)\nteacher: Yes, exactly\nteacher: I believe, other than the fact that this many different ideas packed in little more than 200 pages makes it not a very fit as a 'goodnight read' , there are two main issues with the book:\nteacher: I know we only have a couple of minutes, could you give me some words that would be a more precise fit than 'not very fit for a goodnight read'. What kind of read is it?\nstudent: not a light read, but fit only to be read slowly and trying to understand each new page\nstudent: I wouldn't know how to put it in different words\nteacher: a heavy read is very colloquial, but it is what you're saying here\nteacher: a difficult text\nstudent: Yes, I guess\nteacher: a slow read, too\nteacher: things like that\nteacher: not a light read - sure\nstudent: a slow and heavy read...\nstudent: a text written in very tiny characters\nteacher: Yes, sure!\nstudent: *in very\nteacher: Oh, is the print small?\nstudent: Yes, that was also a problem...it was 200 pages, but in normal print it would have probably been more like 300\nstudent: But that was only an additional problem\nstudent: the problem was that you could never 'relax' while reading\nteacher: Oh I hate that :) small print is so annoying!\nteacher: or, to put it less colloquially, it puts a lot of strain on eyes\nstudent: Indeed it does\nteacher: Anyway, I've got to let you go! We will think about it some more next time!\nstudent: Okay, thank you for your help\nstudent: Have a nice week!!\nteacher: You're very welcome, have a good week too, thank you!",
    "student: hi\nteacher: Hi Samantha!\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: I am fine\nstudent: and you?\nteacher: Fine, thank you!\nteacher: Did you meet the puppy on Friday? Has it got a name yet?\nstudent: yes\nstudent: i did\nstudent: his name is Bailey\nstudent: it is an Azerbaijani name\nstudent: I think\nteacher: Tjat\nteacher: Sorry!\nteacher: That's a nice name!\nteacher: Was he super cute?\nstudent: yes\nstudent: he was biting my leg a lot )\nteacher: I heard there's now a 'weekend lockdown' in force in Kyiv, is that right?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Ah, puppies do that, don't they :)\nstudent: I don't really know anything about that\nteacher: Is it not affecting your life very much?\nstudent: about the lockdown\nstudent: no\nstudent: not this weekend\nteacher: Fair enough! Are your extra classes still open? The acting, the English, the coding and logic?\nstudent: we had logic online this time\nstudent: they rent some classrooms at a university, and it was closed\nstudent: so we had it online because of that\nteacher: oh, they are renting a classroom at  a university?\nstudent: ooops\nstudent: yes\nstudent: a lot of classrooms\nteacher: No worries, this chatroom does that when there's a glitch with the Internet\nstudent: IT IS SNOWWWING\nteacher: Cool! Are you still enjoying acting?\nstudent: it is snowing right now!!!\nteacher: Oh really??????\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Oh my God, I'm so jealous!!\nteacher: It must be beautiful\nstudent: hehe\nstudent: that's because of the rain\nteacher: Is it sub zero? It is going to set?\nstudent: at first it rained\nstudent: but now it is snowing\nteacher: aha, but then the situation changed, so you need ____, not firstly :)\nstudent: so it is not like a really good snow\nstudent: mmm\nteacher: Can you remember what we use if the situation changes? __ ___\nteacher: at first!\nstudent: oh\nteacher: Could you make a full sentence, please, about the rain and the snow\nstudent: at first it was raining, but now it is snowing\nteacher: Perfect :)\nteacher: It must look magical!\nstudent: a bit\nstudent: for you yes)\nstudent: for me it is a bit of a usual thing for November\nteacher: Oh yes, I really hope we'll get at least a day of snow this winter\nteacher: I know :)\nstudent: my dad isn't really happy about that\nteacher: Even though we're much further north than Kyiv!\nteacher: No, why not?\nstudent: he washed his car today\nstudent: it is not clean anymore)\nteacher: It must be disappointing for him!\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Speaking of magic, shall we do a bit of HP stuff today?\nstudent: I don't mind)\nteacher: Good!\nteacher: So, as you know, there are 4 houses in Hogwarts\nstudent: yes\nteacher: And how do students get into those houses?\nstudent: magic hat\nteacher: Yes, it's called the Sorting Hat\nteacher: because it sorts students into houses\nteacher: What kind of students got sorted into Gryffindor?\nstudent: brave\nteacher: Yes! Do you know of any other ways to say 'brave' in English?\nstudent: um\nstudent: I forgot (\nteacher: There's also 'courageous'\nteacher: k\u0259\u02c8re\u026a.d\u0292\u0259s\nstudent: yes\nteacher: courageous = adjective;  courage = noun\nstudent: I know it\nteacher: For example, it takes a lot of courage to stand up to a person in power\nteacher: Ok, what's the noun for 'brave' then?\nteacher: brave = adj.; ?? = noun\nstudent: bravery\nteacher: Well done!\nteacher: and what's the opposite of courage and bravery?\nstudent: i know it from Global Institute of Languages\nteacher: good :)\nstudent: bn\nstudent: oy\nstudent: hmmmm\nteacher: the behaviour of someone who is not brave and tries to avoid danger\nteacher: cowardice\nteacher: \u02c8ka\u028a.\u0259.d\u026as\nstudent: I know fear\nteacher: also a noun\nstudent: I didn't know it\nteacher: Yes, fear is an emotion we feel. But when we feel fear, we can be brave and still do something that frightens us\nteacher: or we can be 'cowardly' and not do it\nteacher: cowardly = adjective\nteacher: Obviously, some people call it 'cautious' :)\nteacher: and a person who is not brave, is a coward\nteacher: no one likes being called a coward :)\nstudent: yeaaah\nteacher: Is there anyone in the HP stories that you would call a coward?\nstudent: makes sense\nstudent: tail\nteacher: oh, Wormtail?\nteacher: absolutely, I agree!\nstudent: Peter (I think) Pettigrew\nstudent: yes\nteacher: yep, I'm with you!\nstudent: how to spell his surname?\nteacher: Peter Pettigrew I think\nstudent: yeah\nteacher: also, if you're brave enough to do something, we can say that you 'dare' do it\nteacher: For example, nobody likes how this teacher talks to the class, but nobody dares stand up to her\nteacher: Or 'I wanted to know how old he was but I didn't dare ask'\nteacher: and the adjective is 'daring'\nteacher: brave / courageous / daring\nteacher: very close meaning\nteacher: Ok, that's for Gryffindor qualities then\nteacher: What about Ravenclaw? What are students like there?\nstudent: smart\nteacher: Ok! Any synonyms to smart?\nstudent: clever\nteacher: Yes, and...\nteacher: i..........\nstudent: intelligent!\nteacher: Yes :)\nstudent: I was typing\nteacher: Well done :)\nteacher: Ok, what about Slytherin?\nstudent: they are also clever, but not like Ravenclaw\nstudent: I forgot the words:(\nteacher: ok, they are amitious, right?\nstudent: yesss\nteacher: oh sorry, *ambitious\nteacher: which is generally a good quality :)\nstudent: I noticed your mistake\nteacher: when you want to achieve something in life\nteacher: well done :)\nstudent: I am in Slytherin\nteacher: what do you mean? (I'm going to ask you what you mean to get longer sentences out of you :))\nstudent: Slytherin is my favorite house, so I think the Sorting Hat should sort me there)\nstudent: (also I like Draco , but it doesn't matter)\nteacher: Ah, good sentence, thank you! And very interesting!\nteacher: I'll give you some more words, and you tell me why :)\nteacher: cunning = adjective; clever at getting what you want, sometimes by tricking people\nteacher: like a cunning fox from fairy tales\nstudent: yes\nstudent: I wanted to say it\nteacher: Yes! So why would you like to be in Slytherin?\nstudent: we forgot about Hufflepuff\nteacher: Ok, Hufflepuff!\nteacher: Who is in Hufflepuff?\nstudent: I think I am a bit cunning\nteacher: what kind of people, I mean\nteacher: Ok! cool!\nstudent: friendly\nteacher: Yes, friendly and kind!\nstudent: and I like Slytherin because everyone thinks people there are a bit scary\nteacher: an adjective that often describes Hufflepuff students is 'humble'\nteacher: \u02c8h\u028cm.b\u0259l\nteacher: which means\nteacher: not proud or arrogant or believing you're too important\nteacher: He's very humble about his success\nteacher: means he doesn't talk about it very much, for example\nteacher: Not many people have this lovely quality :)\nteacher: Ok, so why is Slytherin your favourite house?\nstudent: I've just typed it\nteacher: oh sorry, I missed that!\nteacher: so everyone is a bit afraid of Slytherin people, and you feel it puts them in a powerful position?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Ok))\nstudent: like a dark side of Hogwarts\nteacher: Haha, I see! What do you like about Draco then?\nstudent: he is handsome)\nteacher: haha, fair enough! anything else?\nstudent: and he is a boy who didn't have a choice\nstudent: like Harry, but in another way\nteacher: how do you mean?\nstudent: I am very sorry for him\nteacher: That's an interesting idea!\nteacher: ah, you're sorry for him\nteacher: But yes, he was conflicted, right? He didn't believe everything his family did was a good thing but he thought he had to be loyal to them\nteacher: Ok, I've got a sorting quiz for you! I'm sure you've done them before, but I hope it'll be fun\nteacher: can you open this link?\nstudent: no\nteacher: I just re-sent it to you on Skype\nstudent: okay\nteacher: let me know what you get :)\nstudent: yeah\nstudent: do I have to start it now?\nteacher: yes please!\nstudent: Ravenclaw:(\nteacher: Haha, I thought you'd get Ravenclaw, to be honest :)\nstudent: why?\nteacher: because you're smart :)\nteacher: I wanted to be a Gryffindor! I find courage very important!\nstudent: it is easy to understand what to answer to be at Slytherin\nteacher: But I'm a Hufflepuff according to this quiz\nteacher: Yes, it's pretty transparent\nteacher: still fun\nstudent: I think you are in Hufflepuff too)\nteacher: And, if we were sorted by the real Sorting Hat, we'd have a chance to influence its decision\nteacher: why am I a Hufflepuff?\nteacher: *in Hufflepuff\nstudent: you are really kind\nteacher: aww, thank you!\nteacher: And the patron of Hufflepuff is Helga, a bit like me\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Helga is an old form of Mrs. Jennifer Anderson, I mean\nstudent: how can we influence?\nteacher: Well, you know how the Sorting Hat wanted to put Harry in Slytherin? But he wanted to be in Gryffindor, and the Hat listened to him\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Ok, our words for today: brave - bravery; courageous - courage; to dare (verb) - daring\nstudent: but not everybody can just say that they want to be in Gryffindor\nteacher: humble\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Yes, that's true! It's only because Harry was actually brave, right?\nteacher: Any other words?\nstudent: ambitious\nteacher: Yes!\nteacher: and cunning\nteacher: Ok, I will let you go! Have a good afternoon, speak to you on Friday!\nstudent: thanks\nstudent: you too\nstudent: bye\nteacher: bye :)",
    "teacher: Hi Sophia Williams!\nstudent: Hi Ms. Rachel Adams!\nstudent: How are you?\nteacher: I'm fine, thank you. And how are you? Have you had your flu jab?\nstudent: Yes, it's done )\nstudent: *It\nteacher: Cool! I've got to organize ours too\nstudent: is jab like privivka?\nteacher: Yes, that's right!\nstudent: Oh! Super. Have you done it before?\nteacher: The official word is 'vaccination' (as the process) or a vaccine\nstudent: Because for us it's the first time\nstudent: first\nteacher: Have you had a dose of your flu vaccine? Have you been vaccinated against flu this year?\nteacher: But people just say, have you had a flu jab?\nstudent: wow! something new for me\nstudent: In all senses ))\nteacher: Is it the first time you've had a flu jab?\nteacher: That's good :)\nstudent: Ok, and why do I need present perfect here? )\nteacher: Well, Emma gets his at school, and Brian's company gave him a voucher to pay for a flu jab\nteacher: It's the first time + present perfect\nstudent: Ah, super!\nteacher: It's a bit unusual\nteacher: that it's present perfect\nteacher: but it makes sense because it's in the present, something you've just done\nstudent: It's the first time + present perfect. Ok, so no past?\nstudent: And when I use the expression  It's the first time, do I have to use just present perfect?\nteacher: No! Unless you're talking about the past. It was the first time + past simple / past perfect\nteacher: Yes, that's right\nteacher: e.g. My parents took me to a restaurant when I was 16. It was the first time I had tried wine\nteacher: in the past\nstudent: Ah, Ok! Thank you\nteacher: I can't think of anything that I've done for the first time recently :)))\nstudent: haha\nteacher: It's been the first year that I've worked at home so much\nstudent: some new food?\nteacher: or something like that!\nteacher: It's the first time I've tried tacos\nstudent: )\nstudent: Ok, it's clear. Thank you!\nteacher: I should ask, maybe I'm also eligible for a flu jab voucher like Brian...\nteacher: I want one now!\nteacher: But children, the elderly and pregnant women get a flu jab for free in the UK\nteacher: Because they are more v--------- to flu\nstudent: vulnerable )\nteacher: Remember the word? meaning that flu can be more serious for them\nteacher: Yes! well done :)\nstudent: Unfortunately we don't have the same system here in Ukraine\nstudent: Even more\nteacher: No, it's a shame! It's a good system\nstudent: You know that Rajesh's mum works as a pediatric (?)\nteacher: a pediatrician\nteacher: Yes, I remember!\nstudent: sure! Thank you )\nstudent: Ok, so she needs a flu jab\nteacher: \u02ccpi\u02d0.di.\u0259\u02c8tr\u026a\u0283.\u0259n\nteacher: Ah, that makes sense! Can she get a free one?\nstudent: And the clinic where she is working has to do it for her for free\nstudent: But they don't have the vaccine\nteacher: Oh no, this is awful!!\nstudent: And they've given 500 hrs to each doctor to do it\nteacher: Well, that's something I suppose\nstudent: But today we've spend 1100 for each person\nteacher: Oh my goodness, that's so dear!\nteacher: It's only about 10-12 pounds here I think\nstudent: It's a shame/ They've given just half\nstudent: Oh! It's interesting\nteacher: Yes, awful! Does she work at a state hospital or a private place?\nstudent: It's a French vaccine as I know\nstudent: At a state (\nteacher: Ha, I bet it'll be more expensive after Brexit here too\nstudent: maybe you are right!\nteacher: unfortunately\nstudent: And we haven't done the flu jab for Jacob\nteacher: There is a very strong anti-vaccination movement in the UK (and all over the world it seems!). It's not as strong as in Ukraine, but still bad! And now the government is worried that people won't get vaccinated against covid when there is finally a vaccine\nstudent: We've talked about it with Rajesh's mum\nteacher: Oh, it's a nose spray for children here, not a jab, thankfully\nstudent: She said that if Jacob is in contact just with us and her nanny now, she maybe doesn't need it\nstudent: If all people around get the flu jab\nteacher: Exactly, she is pretty protected\nstudent: So I'm thinking about it.\nteacher: If all people around ____ the flu jab\nstudent: I mean Jacobs flu jab\nstudent: has gone?\nstudent: Oh have gone\nteacher: just 'get', not 'would get'. You need a present simple\nteacher: If everyone gets a flu jab, Jacob won't have to\nteacher: If present simple, will\nstudent: Ms. Rachel Adams : Oh, it's a nose spray for children here, not a jab, thankfully\nteacher: First conditional :)\nstudent: What do you mean? I've missed the context, sorry\nteacher: Oh sorry! I mean the flu vaccine for children is in the form of a nose spray, not an injection\nstudent: If present simple, will - sure. I've been thinking it's not real )\nteacher: But other vaccines are injections (jabs)\nstudent: Really? It's a spray?\nteacher: Ah, if it's not real, that's second conditional. If past simple, would\nteacher: If everyone got vaccinated, the world would be a safer place\nstudent: I think here we have just injections\nteacher: Yes! So good! Because jabs are distressing to children, of course\nstudent: Ah, ok. Sorry, conditionals aren't my 'silnaya storona' )\nteacher: They are not your strong point? Only for now, we will make them :)\nstudent: ))\nstudent: Sure! )\nteacher: Ooh, have you had a chance to read about the Queen?\nstudent: Yes! )\nteacher: Ah! What did you think?\nstudent: And I have some questions about the glossary )\nteacher: Yes please!\nstudent: tenure\nstudent: It's like estate, but here it's like a job\nstudent: I think\nteacher: Let me find it in the context, one second\nstudent: The 58-year-old\u2019s primary role during his 15-year tenure at Buckingham Palace was as Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s personal chef, accompanying her on two royal tours of Australia.\nteacher: Great, thank you!\nteacher: Yes, they just mean 'during the 15 years that he worked at Buckingham Palace'\nstudent: oK! Thank you\nteacher: You are right, it's legal ownership of some estate\nstudent: wilted\nteacher: Or university professors have tenure, which means they can keep their jobs for life\nteacher: If you take fresh greens like spinach and fry them lightly and boil or steam, they will wilt\nstudent: it's like pripushenniy in Russian? About food\nteacher: Of course, they will also wilt in the fridge :)\nteacher: Yes! something like that!\nstudent: thanks )\nstudent: next one\nteacher: when a plant becomes softer and smaller because it's dying, it's wilting\nteacher: flowers wilt\nstudent: warrant\nstudent: Although the Queen reportedly had her fish and chips in a panko breadcrumb rather than traditional batter. As for her condiment of choice - Lea &amp; Perrins, HP Sauce, and Heinz ketchup all hold royal warrants.\nteacher: Ah, thank you! I've been looking for it\nteacher: It means the royals buy from these companies\nteacher: If a company holds a royal warrant, this company sells some good to the royals\nteacher: And this company will put this information on their website etc., because it's quite prestigious\nstudent: Because in the dictionary it's like a document\nteacher: The Queen likes her ketchup! Emma would approve\nstudent: order in Russian\nteacher: yes, like a search warrant or an arrest warrant\nstudent: Yes!!\nstudent: ok\nstudent: next one )\nstudent: shaving\nteacher: In police shows police officers always say, we need to get a search warrant, or something like that :)\nstudent: She is absolutely a chocoholic,' McGrady told Hello! magazine in 2016. 'Anything we put on the menu that had chocolate on, she would choose, especially chocolate perfection pie [a layered chocolate pie with white and dark chocolate and chocolate shavings].'\nteacher: shaving? it comes from 'shave', like shave a beard or shave your legs\nstudent: yes\nteacher: but in this case, they shave chocolate :)))\nstudent: but here..\nteacher: over he cake\nstudent: is it like a cream?\nteacher: *the cake\nstudent: Ah! Ok )\nteacher: no, they take a bar of chocolate and shave it with a special tool, to get thin strips\nstudent: Ah! Like slice?\nteacher: also, a pasta with parmesan shavings\nteacher: yes, but a very thin one\nstudent: ok )\nstudent: Thank you )\nstudent: Salad cream\nstudent: I've googled it )\nstudent: Just a question/ Is it tasty? )\nteacher: here's Jamie on how to decorate a cake with chocolate shavings\nteacher: Haha, good question! I don't think so! I like mayonnaise sometimes, or just olive oil and lemon juice as salad dressing\nstudent: thank you )\nteacher: salad cream is like mayonnaise with some extra ingredients I think\nstudent: Ah, ok ) Because we don't have it here )\nstudent: have\nteacher: You're not missing out!\nstudent: ))\nstudent: ok\nstudent: and now I have three sentences\nteacher: Yes please!\nstudent: Which are not clear to me\nstudent: even four )\nstudent: Although the Queen reportedly had her fish and chips in a panko breadcrumb rather than traditional batter. As for her condiment of choice - Lea &amp; Perrins, HP Sauce, and Heinz ketchup all hold royal warrants.\nstudent: Ah? ok\nstudent: It's clear now\nstudent: sorry\nstudent: And shellfish and rare meat are also avoided during royal visits or tours \u2013 times when the family cannot afford to be out of action with food poisoning. Former royal butler Grant Harold confirmed this rule is sensible when royals are on duty.\nstudent: to be out of action with food poisoning.\nstudent: I mean this part\nteacher: to be out of action = to not be able to work\nstudent: food poisoning\nstudent: like \u00f6travlenie'?\nteacher: a food poisoning = stomach ache, diarrhea, all this stuff\nteacher: yes!\nstudent: ok! It's clear )\nteacher: when the royals are working, they can't have it, so no rare meat for them!\nstudent: \u201cWe did three turkeys for the Queen and her family in the royal dining room, one for the children's nursery and then more for the 100 or so staff, so everyone had a Christmas lunch.'\nstudent: so three turkeys for the Queen and her family\nteacher: Are you wondering how 100 people shared one turkey?\nstudent: one for the children's nursery\nstudent: a nanny?\nteacher: It's a room where children live\nstudent: ah!\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: like, if Jacob has her own room, it's her nursery\nstudent: So one is for children\nteacher: It can also be a word for a kindergarten, confusingly\nstudent: And for those 100 people\nstudent: more\nteacher: Yes, the math is weird here...\nstudent: more is one more than some number?\nstudent: *or\nteacher: 3 turkeys for the grown-up royals, one for the kids and some more turkeys for the staff\nstudent: Ah, ok\nstudent: )\nteacher: I hope they mean several more turkeys! I hope 100 people didn't have to share one turkey\nstudent: )))\nstudent: ok\nstudent: ok\nteacher: Yes, because it doesn't say 'one more'\nstudent: last one\nstudent: And they didn\u2019t scrimp on dessert \u2013 the Christmas pudding would be \u201cdecorated in holly, doused in brandy, and the palace steward would carry it, flaming, into the royal dining room\u201d.\nstudent: scrimp\nstudent: in holly, doused in brandy\nteacher: Oh, the Christmas pudding thing? Because there's so much brandy in it, they light it and it's on fire basically when they serve it\nteacher: if you scrimp, you save money (or some resource)\nteacher: I'm scrimping because I want to save for new shoes\nteacher: or something like that\nstudent: Ah! Thank you!\nteacher: but the royals don't scrimp on dessert, which means that they eat a lot of it, no saving\nteacher: A holly tree is a spiky tree with pretty leaves and red berries\nteacher: It's used as Christmas decoration\nstudent: Ah! Sure! I know it! )\nstudent: Thank you!!!\nteacher: there it is, on top of a Christmas pudding\nstudent: Thank you\nstudent: I see\nstudent: it's very popular\nstudent: even for prints etc\nteacher: What did you think in general? Does the Queen eat well? Is it what you expected?\nteacher: yes, definitely, very Christmassy!\nstudent: She is not a hipster ))\nteacher: nooo, she is a traditionalist :)\nstudent: Ok\nstudent: I've not been surprised\nstudent: I've not been surprised\nteacher: Yes, good correction\nstudent: These scones with jam etc\nteacher: Every single day, in every country she's visited :)\nstudent: She likes very traditional meals\nteacher: What do you think it's like for a chef to work for her?\nstudent: But cereal (\nteacher: that she keeps in Tupperware :)))))\nstudent: Doesn't sound like a royal meal )\nstudent: Tupperware ))))\nstudent: yes\nstudent: it's strange\nteacher: I know, so boring!\nteacher: But maybe she's like Obama who had 7 identical suits when he was a president\nteacher: And wore one every day\nstudent: but in general I think she eats the food she must eat )\nteacher: Just not to have to think about what to wear\nteacher: Oh, because she is the symbol of the UK?\nstudent: maybe\nstudent: And you know\nstudent: She looks like a very conservative person\nteacher: Definitely! She basically always wears the same dress, but in different colours, doesn't she?\nstudent: Sure!\nstudent: But she is nice )\nteacher: When I was reading it, I thought it had to be so frustrating for an excellent chef to be chopping meat for her dogs or peeling carrots for the horses :)\nstudent: Boring, but nice )\nteacher: that don't even need their carrots to be peeled)))\nstudent: hahaha\nteacher: Definitely! Ooh, now that you have Netflix you can watch the Crown!\nstudent: I think about it )\nstudent: I've started The Queen's Gambit\nteacher: Wonderful! We can talk about it next time, we are now on episode 3\nstudent: But today Rajesh wants to watch a film..\nstudent: hm\nstudent: I don't remember the name\nstudent: With Helen Mirren\nteacher: Oh, she played the Queen too\nteacher: Is it a new one? I don't know\nstudent: We've seen it on Netflix\nteacher: I suppose there aren't many new films this year!\nstudent: The Good Liar I think\nteacher: I haven't seen this one, but I think I've heard about it\nstudent: We will try )\nteacher: Ok, I'll let you go! Have a lovely afternoon, speak to you on Friday!\nstudent: Thank you! You too!\nstudent: See you!\nteacher: Bye :)\nstudent: bye )",
    "teacher: Hi Anna Smith!\nstudent: Hello, I have downloaded the PDF\nstudent: Thanks a lot.\nteacher: Great, we'll be using it later on\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: OK, I'm fine.\nteacher: Are you having a good week?\nstudent: Yes, it has still been a busy week for me.\nstudent: This week is so cold in Beijing.\nteacher: Oh really? Is there any snow?\nstudent: No. It's not cold enough to have a snow day, but it rained yesterday.\nteacher: Oh, it rained yesterday, I see\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: It's getting a bit cold in the UK too, we've had a very mild November until now\nteacher: Are you reading anything interesting? Or are you too busy?\nstudent: I'm still reading 'Harry Potter'.\nteacher: Sure! How is it going? What are you reading about at the moment?\nstudent: I've started reading from the first book. Harry is now at the school of magic.\nteacher: Ah, at Hogwarts, that's right\nstudent: I watched the movies before, so I think it's not hard to me.\nstudent: Yes.\nteacher: That's good! It's good to start reading in English with something that's a bit easier and quite familiar too\nteacher: If you continue to other Harry Potter books, they actually become pretty complicated in terms of language, so you'll have a good chance to build up to that\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: Because I watched the movies before, so I think it's not hard for me. Because ... so Do you think you need both of them, because and so?\nstudent: Just one of them.\nteacher: Yes, which one would you go for?\nstudent: I think it's like Chinese English, haha\nstudent: so\nteacher: oh, is this how it works in Chinese? Sure\nteacher: Yes, good idea!\nteacher: or you could keep 'because', but probably swap clauses so that you're not starting with it\nstudent: Chinese must have because and so at the same time in this case.\nstudent: Let me try.\nteacher: I think it's not hard for me because I watched the movies\nteacher: Sorry, go on!\nstudent: I know now. Thanks\nteacher: Sorry, I should have let you do this\nteacher: You'll have more opportunities to practice I'm sure!\nstudent: Thanks.\nteacher: So, as you can probably guess from the pdf I sent you, we're going to do some B2 writing today!\nstudent: Yes, great!\nteacher: Or better, we're going to prepare to do it, and then you will write the essay as homework if that's ok\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: In a B2 exam, there are two parts to writing. In part 1, you can't choose the task, you have to do the task they give you\nteacher: In part 2, you can choose the task that you like best, usually out of 3\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: There is a time limit, 1 hour and 20 minutes for everything\nteacher: But it's best to aim at about 30-35 minutes for each task, so that you have a chance to go back and check your work at the end\nteacher: And a word limit of 140-190 words\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: If you do a computer-based test, the program calculates the words for you. But if you choose a paper-based test, you have to count them yourself to make sure your writing is not too short or not too long (you would lose points for either, too short or too long)\nteacher: So I would recommend counting the words when you practice, too\nteacher: And also setting a time limit for yourself, just to get an idea of how fast you have to write in the real test\nstudent: OK.\nstudent: So is the real exam computer-based or paper-based?\nteacher: Is this similar to the English tests you've done before? Maybe gao kao?\nteacher: You can choose a computer- or a paper-based exam. The tasks are exactly the same. It also depends on the exam centre, some of them only offer computer-based tests, for example, or only paper-based ones\nstudent: Yes. I had a lot of writing in exams which was maybe about 300 words.\nteacher: Ok, I see, so you're used to counting words, that's good. Yes, you basically need to write about 300 words, between the two parts\nteacher: Ok, can you have a look at task 1 in the pdf, please? The one about the environment\nstudent: OK.\nstudent: I finished.\nteacher: Great!\nteacher: So the question is, do you think these problems can be solved?\nteacher: It is very important to answer this question rather than just describe the problems\nteacher: And also, the task says that you have to write about 1) transport 2) rivers and seas 3) your own idea\nstudent: In this part, do I need a yes or no answer?\nteacher: Well, you need to say, yes, I think these problems can be solved because...\nteacher: or\nteacher: no, I think it is too late to solve these problems because\nteacher: You need to explain why you think so\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: Basically, the task has already given you a plan for the essay\nstudent: Yes. I think these problems can be solved.\nteacher: 1. Short introduction. Maybe about how people are trying to solve environment problems\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: 2. Transport: can problems created by transport be solved? why?\nteacher: 3. Seas and river: can problems with seas and rivers be solved? why?\nteacher: 4. Your idea: problems and solutions\nteacher: 140-190 is actually not a lot, so it's important to get straight to the point\nteacher: 140-190 words I mean\nstudent: OK.\nstudent: I know the structure\nteacher: Let's prepare a bit. What environmental problems created by transport can you think of?\nteacher: Lovely!\nstudent: Too many cars can generate too much CO2 gas. And the CO2 can pollute the air.\nteacher: Ok, good!\nteacher: do you know the word for CO2?\nteacher: carbon dioxide, right?\nstudent: Yes. But I don\u2019t know how to write it.\nteacher: carbon dioxide, a good word to learn\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: also, break the air condition = I see what you mean, but this is not how we say it. Let's try\nteacher: The carbon dioxide pollutes the air / creates air pollution\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: also, there is carbon dioxide in the air naturally, right? And this is not a problem, the problem is when there is too much of it\nteacher: too much carbon dioxide = excessive carbon dioxide\nteacher: excessive = good B2 word :)\nstudent: OK. Thanks\nteacher: Lovely, could you re-write your sentences using some of my suggestions, please?\nstudent: There are environmental problems created by transport. For example, excessive carbon dioxide generated by too many cars can create air pollution.\nstudent: create\nteacher: Good! And a good correction, create\nteacher: dioXide, with an X\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: Very good grammar, actually. One tiny thing: For example, excessive carbon dioxide which __ generated by too many cars can create air pollution\nstudent: is\nteacher: Yes, well done!\nteacher: And do you think this problem can be solved?\nstudent: Yes.\nteacher: Ok, why do you think so?\nstudent: We can call on people to use public buses or subway to travel. And if someone really wants to drive a car, then they can drive electric cars.\nteacher: Excellent!\nteacher: And if someone really ____ to drive a car\nstudent: needs\nteacher: wants is fine, you just forgot the ending -s\nteacher: Great sentences!\nteacher: What about seas and rivers? What are some problems with them?\nstudent: Yes. There is a lot of plastic rubbish in seas and rivers. If fish eat these things, they will die.\nteacher: Yes, true\nteacher: There __ a lot of plastic rubbish\nstudent: is?\nteacher: Yes, definitely. Rubbish is an uncountable singular noun\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: which means we can't use it in the plural\nteacher: Ok, great work today! The homework, as I'm sure you've guessed, will be to write this part 1 essay, ok? You can send it to me before our Monday class if you have a chance, so that I can have a look at it and prepare for the class\nstudent: OK.\nstudent: Thanks a lot. I will send it to your email.\nteacher: Lovely, thank you! Have a good weekend!\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: Bye!\nstudent: See you next Monday\nstudent: Bye",
    "student: Hi, Mrs. Johnson!\nstudent: How are you?\nteacher: Hi Megan Smith!\nteacher: Fine, thank you! And you?\nstudent: I'm ok, thank you\nstudent: One more yoga today )\nstudent: I have had )\nteacher: :)) excellent!\nteacher: Are you getting into yoga then?\nstudent: And I'm returning to teaching )\nstudent: get into. hm )\nteacher: get into = start liking something and doing more of it\nstudent: Today I'll have a lesson of Ukrainian with my old student )\nteacher: For example, I had just got into swimming before our local swimming pool had to close\nteacher: Oh nice! Are you looking forward to doing some teaching again?\nstudent: Yes, sure! I'm getting into it, but I still have two training sessions per week\nstudent: I'd prefer to have three\nteacher: I see! You must be enjoying it then!\nstudent: And the teacher has even added one more training\nstudent: But it's not yoga\nstudent: It's like 'sylovie trnirovki' )\nteacher: Oh, I see, like 'strength training'\nstudent: And as you know because I have some problems with my back I'm not sure that it's a good idea to do this sort of sport\nstudent: Yes, strength trainings\nteacher: Yes, definitely, you've got to be gentle with your back!\nstudent: So, about the lessons of Ukrainian\nteacher: yes\nstudent: Do you maybe remember that for the last 3,5 years I haven't had many lessons?\nteacher: Yes, since Liam was born\nstudent: Sure\nteacher: good present perfect :)\nstudent: I've had only three students since Liam was born )\nstudent: They were my old old students\nstudent: s\nteacher: I see! good present perfect again :)\nstudent: haha ) I try to do my best )\nteacher: oh, you've made an exception for your old student?\nstudent: All these students preferred (?) to work with me\nstudent: Yes. They all are my friends now\nteacher: Yes, preferred is good, double rr in the past\nstudent: One Italian girl, one Korean and a French man\nstudent: man\nstudent: Thank you/ So preferred )\nstudent: Ok, now it's my French friend Nathan\nteacher: You can also say, they requested to work with you / requested you as a teacher\nteacher: request = good work to describe clients' preferences)\nstudent: He has been working for OIFF for the last 5 years or so\nteacher: What's OIFF?\nstudent: He was in Ukraine till October I think and now he is in Columbia\nteacher: Oh, the Odesa Film Festival?\nteacher: Nice!\nstudent: Because his girlfriend works there\nstudent: Odesa Film Festival, sorry\nstudent: I've confused you\nteacher: I try to read the news in Ukrainian, but the other day I read a book review, and boy it was difficult!\nteacher: I was a bit disappointed in my Ukrainian, actually\nteacher: maybe I need classes too :)\nstudent: So now he doesn't have any practice of Ukrainian and Russian\nteacher: Well, my spoken and written Ukrainian has never been brilliant, but I thought I could at least read ok\nstudent: sometimes they use very strange language in the news etc I think\nstudent: And about the book review\nteacher: I think the news are easier for me because there are lots of words borrowed from English\nstudent: think it could be written in some strange language\nteacher: Maybe I'll send a couple of sentences from it to you later on and you can help me make sense of it))\nteacher: The language might be a bit weird or it might be me!\nstudent: For example, I've bought a Hemingway book in Ukrainian and I couldn't read it\nteacher: Seriously?\nstudent: The translation was so hard to read\nstudent: I'll help you with pleasure!\nteacher: Interesting! I wonder if the translator used some western Ukrainian words, for example\nteacher: Thank you! :)\nteacher: Let's have a quick look back on our modals of deduction before we move on !\nstudent: Ok, so this student would like to work with speaking and pronunciation\nstudent: Sorry, can I ask you a question?\nteacher: Yes, sure!\nteacher: But he doesn't want any grammar, like my pretend student? :)))\nstudent: As a very experienced teacher what do you think is the best way to practise pronunciation\nstudent: Oh, he is so good at Russian and Ukrainian\nteacher: Ok, that's not a problem then!\nstudent: He is very talented with languages and he speaks these two languages at a very high level\nstudent: We can speak with him nearly like with a native speaker\nteacher: Oh wow, that's amazing! It must be really hard to reach this level of proficiency in Russian and Ukrainian\nstudent: As A very experienced teacher? actually ))\nteacher: Oh, sorry, I completely missed your question!\nteacher: Yes, a!\nstudent: Yes, I think he is very talented\nteacher: and thank you\nstudent: He speaks French, Spanish, English, Ukrainian, Russian and Arabic if I'm right\nstudent: what do you think is the best practice for his pronunciation? )\nstudent: You don't know him but I mean for the student of such a high level\nteacher: Well, we did a comparative phonetics course at university. It was all about how English sounds are different from Russian and what to pay attention to, but I have no idea what a French accent sounds like in Russian / Ukrainian\nteacher: I mean, I know what sounds speakers of English have trouble with\nstudent: I see\nteacher: but not sure about the French!\nteacher: I would maybe focus on intonations because they are very important in Russian\nstudent: Sometimes he sounds too soft )\nteacher: Maybe more so than in English, because in English we use grammar to make questions, for example, but in Russian we use intonation\nstudent: And what do you think about activities?\nstudent: Just talk and work with problem things?\nteacher: I would say so! Just talk and troubleshoot\nstudent: thank you )\nstudent: Actually he is so good at intonations )\nteacher: It's hard to say in my native language! I know lots of activities for English but not for Russian! And I wish I knew some for Ukrainian, that would be helpful for me too\nstudent: It seems strange, but as a teacher I even don't know why he would like to have lessons )\nteacher: Palatalization is a term for how we make consonants sound 'hard' or 'soft'\nteacher: So that might be a good way to explain it\nteacher: It's about the position of a tongue touching the palate\nteacher: a palate = the roof of the mouth\nstudent: I see\nteacher: The stuff I remember from university :)\nstudent: )) Good job )\nteacher: Some people need a logical explanation when it comes to pronunciation but some just imitate really well!\nteacher: Haha, yes\nstudent: Ok, thank you, sorry for interrupting you )\nteacher: Goodness, we haven't got much time left for our role play!\nstudent: Let's start with the modals )\nteacher: That's it!\nteacher: So, if my friend hasn't been talking to me and I don't know whether something is wrong, I think, 'Hmmm, she ___ be angry with me!' (but I'm not sure)\nstudent: might\nteacher: Ok, might / ? / ?\nteacher: two more options if you remember :)\nstudent: she might be angry\nstudent: sorry )\nteacher: Might is perfect, but also 'may' and 'could', right?\nteacher: she could be angry, she may be angry\nstudent: Sure!\nstudent: Sorry\nteacher: Ok! My husband comes home and his coat is all wet. I say, 'Oh wow, it __ be raining!'\nstudent: I haven't caught the idea )\nteacher: I'm pretty sure\nteacher: sorry, no worries!\nstudent: it must be raining!\nteacher: Yes! Correct :)\nstudent: Just one option )\nteacher: That's right!\nteacher: Then I say, Megan Smith, I flew from London to Kyiv in just 30 minutes. And you say, 'Sorry, it ___ be true!'\nstudent: can't )\nteacher: Yes, correct!\nteacher: I'm going to send you a link to a 'mystery picture'. An enlarged picture of an everyday object.

I didn't know it!\nteacher: For example, client: my teacher is always late for class\nteacher: You: Dear Peter, Thank you for bringing it up. We will look into this immediately\nstudent: Thank you for bringing it up. We will be happy to fire him )\nteacher: That's it :)))\nteacher: I don't know, you probably don't get many complaints! I was just thinking about what situations might happen, and you are welcome to tell me what actually happens and what you need in terms of English!\nstudent: Sometimes we have\nstudent: so it's very useful\nteacher: Cool! I've got loads here. One last before we go!\nstudent: And when we haven't had an answer from a student\nstudent: And we write to him or her again?\nstudent: About payment for example\nteacher: Ah good one\nteacher: Hello Peter,\nteacher: I am just checking in to see if you have received my email from November 1 2020 and whether you are still interested in classes with us.\nteacher: something like that\nstudent: oh? thank you!\nteacher: / if you have had a chance to think about ....\nteacher: something like that\nstudent: ok!\nteacher: If you have had a chance to.... = good formula, because it leaves a person a chance to say, oh no, I've been to busy\nteacher: or something like that\nstudent: Yes! Sure!\nteacher: Ok,I've got to let you go! We can look at the rest of it on Wednesday, and practice too!\nteacher: I can't wait to play an annoying client)))\nstudent: haha\nstudent: ok!\nstudent: Thank you very much!\nstudent: thank\nstudent: See you then )\nteacher: Ok, could you please close the program, so that it has a chance to restart before my next class?

I can't remember\nstudent: kind\nstudent: friendly\nteacher: Yes, I'm trying to remember if we had any more 'advanced' words\nteacher: Oh, I remember!\nteacher: a person who is doesn't speak much about their success and achievement is ...\nstudent: shy?\nteacher: Good option, but it's something else\nteacher: not proud or believing they are important\nteacher: h.....\nstudent: honor\nstudent: no\nteacher: humble\nstudent: oh\nteacher: also, we can use it to describe objects, not just people\nteacher: she wears humble clothes\nteacher: a humble pie (nothing special about it, but probably good)\nteacher: Ok, let's talk!\nteacher: Do you think it's important to be courageous in life?\nstudent: yes,but not really\nteacher: Ok, tell me more, please :)\nstudent: with some things you can be a coward\nstudent: that's okay\nteacher: Ok, could you give me an example maybe?\nstudent: for example\nstudent: horror films\nteacher: what about them?\nstudent: somebody dislikes them because they are scary\nteacher: I'm going to pretend I don't understand what you're trying to say because you are capable of much better English and nice long sentences, Eleanor Smith! :)\nteacher: So it's ok to be a coward about watching horror films?\nstudent: and for example your friend said that you are a coward just because you don't want to watch this film\nstudent: you are not a coward in this situation\nstudent: you can choose\nstudent: and if you\nstudent: *your friend said that you are a coward, so maybe he or she is not a good friend?\nteacher: Yes, I completely agree with you, it's important to stand up for your choices in a friendship!\nteacher: it's actually courageous to do so, right? to stand up to your friend and say, no, I'm not a coward even though I don't enjoy horror films\nteacher: I don't like horror films either, by the way\nstudent: yes\nstudent: I don't like some moments in horror films\nteacher: Ok, in what other situations might it be important to be courageous?\nstudent: but I can watch them\nteacher: Sure!\nteacher: I don't enjoy them at all, there are so many other films to watch\nstudent: for example\nstudent: you have a secret\nstudent: you don't want to tell it to your friends\nstudent: *ds\nstudent: or parents\nstudent: but one day they will know about it\nstudent: so it is better to say it now than never\nteacher: yes, it can take a lot of courage, I agree, good example!\nteacher: Ok, what about being ambitious? Is it important to be ambitious? Is it different for boys and girls? or men and women?\nstudent: no\nstudent: it is not different\nteacher: why not?\nstudent: everybody is the same\nstudent: it doesn't matter who you are\nstudent: boy or girl\nstudent: just each person has his or her own goal\nteacher: I completely agree!\nteacher: except for the grammar :)\nteacher: everybody __ the same\nstudent: is\nteacher: that's right!\nteacher: well, everybody is different, everybody is a different person, but it's very important that everybody is equal\nteacher: equal = the same in importance or deserving the same treatment\nteacher: we can talk about\nteacher: equal opportunities'\nteacher: for everyone\nteacher: and the noun is 'equality'\nteacher: gender equality, racial equality etc.\nteacher: It was a bit of a provocative question, but I'm so glad you believe in equality, I do too!\nstudent: hehe\nteacher: So many people would still say that girls just need to marry well :)\nteacher: so I'm glad we're are on the same page :)\nstudent: ew\nstudent: hate that\nteacher: Yes, me too!\nteacher: Do you know the noun for 'ambitous'? something you want to achieve\nstudent: ambition\nteacher: Correct!\nteacher: Ok, I was thinking about the Hogwarts houses\nteacher: Do you remember the heads of houses? Like Professor McGonagall\nstudent: Professor Snape\nteacher: Yes!\nteacher: Was it Professor Sprout for Hufflepuff?\nstudent: yes\nstudent: I was trying to remember her name\nteacher: and Professor Flitwick for Ravenclaw, right?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: I'm just thinking, what kind of a speech they could give to their new students at the beginning of a school year\nteacher: What do you think Professor McGonagall could say to new Gryffindors? Could you right 3-4 sentences, using some of our new words?\nteacher: I'll give you 5 minutes\nstudent: usually that's what Dumbledore does\nteacher: True, but maybe the heads of houses do to, we just don't know)\nteacher: but we can imagine\nstudent: If you are in Gryffindor, then you must be really brave. I believe that you are really courageous and powerful. If you are a coward or you are weak.\nstudent: oy\nteacher: no problem, continue\nstudent: last sentence is not really good\nstudent: don't read it)\nteacher: ok!\nstudent: You shouldn't be a coward no matter who you are or where you are\nteacher: Aha, nearly\nstudent: *no matter\nteacher: You shouldn't be a coward no matter who __ __ or where __ __\nstudent: you are\nstudent: oy\nstudent: you are\nstudent: i thought I wrote you are\nteacher: correct! you need reported speech word order, right?\nteacher: Good one! Thank you!\nstudent: yes\nteacher: And what do you think Snape could say to his new students?\nstudent: You must be clever and ambitious. It must be your ambition to win in the annual contest of houses.You should study well\nteacher: Yes, it must be your ambition, correct!\nteacher: what's the adjective for something that happens every year? starts with a-\nstudent: um\nteacher: annual\nteacher: the stress is on the first syllable\nteacher: Annual\nteacher: an annual contest\nstudent: annual\nteacher: what about the clever and mysterious Ravenclaws?\nstudent: You should do all your homework . You must study hard. You should study\nstudent: oy\nteacher: You should is fine!\nteacher: are you confused about 'should' and 'must'?\nteacher: should sounds milder, more like advice\nstudent: no\nstudent: about third sentence\nstudent: I didn't finish writing it\nstudent: but accidentally sent it\nteacher: ah, no problem!\nteacher: How about you write your Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff speeches as homework, ok?\nteacher: And show me on Tuesday\nstudent: You should read more books than the school gives\nstudent: here is Ravenclaw\nstudent: only Hufflepuff\nteacher: Yes, good! Only Hufflepuff :)\nstudent: bye\nteacher: Ok, Eleanor Smith, thank you, have a lovely weekend!\nteacher: Bye!\nstudent: thank you for the lesson\nteacher: It's my pleasure :)",
    "teacher: Hi AlexandraWolf!\nstudent: Hello, Mrs. Jackson\nteacher: How are you today? Did you have a good weekend?\nstudent: Yes. This weekend I had a good rest.\nteacher: Wonderful! How do you like to spend your weekends?\nstudent: Well, I often watch some movies and football games.\nteacher: Sounds nice! I also like to watch a movie and read a book at the weekend\nstudent: And now I need to prepare for my exam, so I always spend some time learning.\nteacher: Do you mean B2? or are you planning to take other exams as well?\nteacher: prepare __ my exam (what goes in the gap?)\nstudent: prepare for my PhD exam\nteacher: Oh I see! When is your exam?\nteacher: Yes, that's right, prepare FOR\nstudent: There is no clear time, but I think maybe in April 2021.\nteacher: I see! You've still got plenty of time, yes\nteacher: ___ ___ no clear time\nteacher: a useful structure here would be 'there is'\nstudent: There is\nstudent: Yes.\nstudent: It's not clear; or there is no clear time\nteacher: Absolutely, yes! very good options\nteacher: I like to be outdoors at the weekend, and I especially like to garden now that we can't go out because of the lockdown\nstudent: Sorry about that.\nstudent: This season is so great when you are outdoors.\nteacher: Thank you. It's what we have to do, so I'm ok with that :)\nteacher: Yes, apparently, the winter is going to be quite cold!\nteacher: Do you like winter?\nstudent: In Beijing, we're having an icy day today.\nstudent: Yes. I like winter especially in the north-east of China.\nteacher: Cool! What do you like about it?\nstudent: The essential reason may be the snow.\nstudent: essential\nteacher: Ah! Snow! We don't get much snow in my part of England\nteacher: Do you do any winter sports?\nstudent: Yes. I like ice skating.\nteacher: Nice! ice-skating\nteacher: People used to go ice-skating here, but now there is no ice because of the climate change\nstudent: So it's warm in your place.\nteacher: Well, winters tend to be mild and wet. It can be maybe -2 or -3 at night, but the temperature is usually above zero in the daytime\nteacher: But I live in the east of England. It's colder in the north and definitely much colder in Scotland\nstudent: OK. it's just like now in Beijing.\nteacher: I think it was similar in Shanghai. I only remember a couple of days when temperature fell below 0\nstudent: I know.\nteacher: What's your favourite season then?\nstudent: I like winter and spring.\nteacher: Ok, why?\nteacher: It's a common B2 question :)\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: Are you typing an answer or waiting for me? It's hard to tell in this programme!\nstudent: First of all, I do not like hot weather, while cold is Ok. Secondly, I like the vitality of spring.\nstudent: I'm trying to type these things.\nteacher: Yes, well done!\nstudent: But if it's a question, I think I must pick one season.\nteacher: I see :) I'm the opposite, I love the warmth!\nteacher: No, you don't have to! two seasons are fine :)\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: A depressing thing about winter is that days are so short. I love long summer days!\nteacher: Thank you for the homework you sent me! Very well done!\nteacher: Let's have a good look at it, shall we?\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: Yes, I think the problems with pollution and damage to the environment can be solved.   Firstly the excessive cars that generate more gas can cause air pollution. So we need to call on people travelling by bus or subway. If you really need to drive a car, you can try an electric car. Secondly, there are a lot of plastic rubbish in the rivers and seas that can cause a large amount of fish to die. So we should avoid using plastic bags and do well in recycling. The plastic bags will still be there for a long period,  so we must collect them nowadays. By the way, we also need to create new types of bags which can not cause pollution. Thirdly, in my opinion, We can do two more essential measures to solve these pollution problems. One is trying to do rubbish classification, and the other is to learn environmental knowledge.   With these measures, I think our environmental problems will be getting better and better.\nteacher: I like the first sentence! Nice clear introduction, and it answers the question too. I would drop 'yes', so that it's more like the beginning of an essay\nteacher: Just 'I think the problems with pollution and damage to the environment can be solved'\nstudent: At first I spent 30 min, but I just wrote 110 words, then I added something, so I spent more time, like 45 min.\nteacher: Ok, good that timed yourself! It's important! It's only the first attempt, and your time is not that far off, it will get better!\nteacher: Is your Internet connection ok?\nstudent: My network is not good, I can not send anything\nstudent: Now it's OK I think.\nteacher: Ok, yes, no problem\nstudent: Let me see the first sentence.\nteacher: Ok, good that you timed yourself! It's important! It's only the first attempt, and your time is not that far off, it will get better!\nstudent: Thanks.\nteacher: Ok, the next sentence\nteacher: Firstly the excessive cars that generate more gas can cause air pollution.\nteacher: the word for what cars generate is 'exhaust'\nteacher: excessive cars that generate exhaust\nteacher: or you can just you the word we learned last time, what's the word for CO2?\nstudent: carbon dioxide\nstudent: carbon\nteacher: yes, that's right!\nteacher: I know the exhaust generated by cars is not all carbon dioxide, but it will work in the essay too\nteacher: So we need to call on people travelling by bus or subway.\nstudent: The exhaust is a noun?\nteacher: Yes, that's right!\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: It can be a verb or a noun. And you know the adjective 'exhausted', right? meaning 'very tired'\nteacher: If you exhaust your resources, you have nothing left\nstudent: Yes, I know the verb\nteacher: and the noun 'exhaust' is the waste product of a car\nteacher: Yes, good!\nteacher: Ok, the next one!\nteacher: So we need to call on people travelling by bus or subway.\nteacher: Good sentence, the only problem is 'call on people to do something'\nteacher: We need to call on people to travel by bus or subway\nstudent: OK. I thought 'to do' stressed travel, 'doing' stressed by bus...\nteacher: Hmm, no, sorry. It's about the verb 'call on'. Call on someone to do something\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: For example, the government has called on people to wear face masks and stop socializing\nteacher: Are you ok with that?\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: Your next sentence is really good!\nteacher: If you really need to drive a car, you can try an electric car.\nteacher: No problems with this one\nstudent: Thanks\nteacher: Next one! Only one problem\nteacher: Secondly, there are a lot of plastic rubbish in the rivers and seas that can cause a large amount of fish to die.\nteacher: How would you correct it if you know that 'rubbish' is a singular uncountable noun\nstudent: there is\nteacher: Yes! Well done!!\nteacher: So we should avoid using plastic bags and do well in recycling.\nteacher: do well in recycling' sounds a bit weird, you can just say, 'recycle the waste'\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: or maybe, 'recycle more' or 'improve recycling'\nteacher: The plastic bags will still be there for a long period,  so we must collect them nowadays.\nteacher: Good sentence, the grammar is good!\nteacher: By the way, we also need to create new types of bags which can not cause pollution.\nteacher: Same thing! Good sentence :)\nteacher: Thirdly, in my opinion, We can do two more essential measures to solve these pollution problems.\nteacher: the expression is 'to take measures'\nteacher: so 'we can take two more essential measures'\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: Ok!\nteacher: One is trying to do rubbish classification, and the other is to learn environmental knowledge.\nteacher: I think what you mean with the first measure is 'sorting waste'\nteacher: We sort waste to be able to recycle, right?\nteacher: And strangely, 'learn' doesn't work with 'knowledge'\nteacher: we can 'acquire / gain / have' knowledge\nteacher: for example, to gain deeper knowledge of the environment\nteacher: Could you re-write this sentence, please?\nstudent: One is trying to sort waste, and the other is to have environmental knowledge.\nteacher: Ok, this is better, but you mean to learn, right? so maybe to 'gain more environmental knowledge'\nteacher: or to 'learn to understand the environment better'?\nstudent: One is trying to sort waste, and the other is to gain deeper knowledge of the environment.\nteacher: Ooh, very good, yes!\nteacher: With these measures, I think our environmental problems will be getting better and better.\nteacher: Another good sentence!\nstudent: The network is not good at my place.\nteacher: Well done with your writing!\nstudent: Thanks.\nteacher: Some new expressions for today: sort waste, exhaust (from cars), take measure, call on people to do something, gain / acquire / have knowledge\nstudent: It's a little like writing in the gaokao exam.\nteacher: Oh really? That's good, it's familiar for you then!\nstudent: OK. I have notes for this.\nteacher: Lovely\nteacher: So you're optimistic about the environmental problems we are facing?\nstudent: Yes.\nteacher: That's good! I've read on the news that China plans to be carbon neutral in a few years!\nteacher: Do you feel a lot is being done about the environment in China?\nstudent: The Chinese government indeed have some rules to save the environment.\nteacher: The UK is trying to switch to clean energy, but it feels like a slow process\nteacher: That's good!\nstudent: Near my hometown some industries have already shut down.\nstudent: industries\nteacher: Ok, because they were too polluting?\nstudent: And in China, petrol is so expensive.\nteacher: Interesting!\nteacher: I bet that motivates people to drive less!\nstudent: Yes. They have waste water which can pollute underground water.\nteacher: I see! It's good to hear the government is taking tough action!\nstudent: Yes. People often say that you can buy a car, but you cannot afford to drive it.\nteacher: Oh, very interesting!\nteacher: Most people in the UK have one or two or even three cars per family. It's crazy!\nteacher: We don't have a car because we've always used the train and we cycle around our town\nteacher: But our town is tiny by Chinese standards\nstudent: Like a college?\nteacher: Our town has the population of about 22 thousand people\nstudent: OK.\nstudent: Smaller than my college.\nteacher: Anyway, thank for today, great work! I'll speak to you on Thursday!\nteacher: Haha, yes, I bet it's smaller than your college!\nstudent: Thanks for your help.\nteacher: It's my pleasure. Take care!\nstudent: Take care, thanks, bye",
    "student: Hi Ms. Rodriguez!\nteacher: Hi Emma!\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: Fine thank you! And you?\nteacher: Good, thank you! Very excited about our new broadband that has just been put in, the fibre optic one. I hope the Internet will be faster and more reliable now!\nstudent: Haha..that's great news! Unfortunately I can't have fibre optic at home for now..no cable outside...and I live 5km from the center of Graz!\nstudent: but at least it usually works fine...how was your weekend?\nteacher: Nice and relaxing, thank you! How was yours?\nteacher: The fibre optic has just reached our little town, and we jumped at the opportunity\nstudent: It was nice...but not relaxing: the kids had too much energy so it was also a bit tiring.\nstudent: I think you did the right thing: nowadays a reliable and fast Internet is quite practical...\nteacher: Yes, it's a full time job with young kids, I can imagine!\nteacher: My husband and I both work from home, so it's a lifeline\nstudent: Haha...I agree...\nteacher: They've only connected it 5 minutes ago, right before the class. I was worried I'd be late! But I think the Internet is already faster, yay!\nteacher: Well, my husband used to commute to Cambridge before the lockdown, but he hasn't for the last 8 months\nteacher: How's your wife? Has she had any hunting for a job?\nteacher: *has she had any luck\nstudent: Sorry, I had to take care of the children, one moment...\nteacher: No problem!\nstudent: she had two job interviews...she thinks they went okay, even though she still has some difficulties with German\nstudent: but we are still waiting for some responses\nstudent: The problem is that many people here speak German dialects, so she will have to learn those too\nteacher: There's such a shortage of nurses in the UK she could just walk into any hospital and be hired here I suspect\nstudent: as a nurse you need to understand every patient :)\nteacher: oh goodness, that's challenging!\nstudent: Here there is a shortage too, so I believe she will get at least one of the jobs...one is for a small clinic so it is a bit more difficult since they have only few workers.\nteacher: I see! Good luck with that, hope she will find what she wants!\nstudent: Thank you!\nteacher: Ok, shall we delve back into writing and editing?\nstudent: Yes :)\nteacher: Great!\nteacher: The next sentence\nteacher: the copy I read came from the library and was printed in 1997: there have been many discoveries in these last 21 years and this would make space  for a new revised edition of the book\nteacher: I would just object to 'these' and use 'the' instead\nteacher: the basically means 'these' here, but doesn't stand out as much\nstudent: hmm\nteacher: Also, in the spirit of looking for a more precise expression, I would challenge 'make space for'. Can you think of anything else that could work here?\nstudent: I can't understand your first suggestion...\nteacher: About the article?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: there have been many discoveries in the last 21 years\nteacher: the last X years sounds better to me\nstudent: oh I see now\nstudent: about the expressions...probably 'make room' is better than 'make space'...\nteacher: Sorry!\nstudent: No problem...\nstudent: But I am not sure that 'make room' would be the best expression here...\nteacher: Make space / room are both fine expressions, I'm just wondering if they are right for the situation\nteacher: the new discoveries ____ a revised edition\nteacher: I would suggest 'call for'\nteacher: or 'make a case for'\nstudent: yes, I like 'call for'\nteacher: because the meaning you're after is 'necessitate', not make room for\nstudent: or made a revised edition necessary\nteacher: yes, good too\nteacher: to make it the sentence more concise, I would also maybe go for 'there have been many discoveries in the last 21 years which call for...\nteacher: Oh goodness, I've just remembered I've promised you some extra practice with reduced adverbial phrases!\nteacher: I will make a note this time and prepare something for next week\nstudent: Okay, don't worry! Next week is fine\nteacher: Sure, thanks\nteacher: Ok, the next sentence!\nteacher: It also delves into the problems regarding the idea of 'omnipotence' and, in practicse , it suggests atheism as the only 'reasonable' view.\nteacher: About the chapter on logic\nstudent: I see a spelling mistake\nstudent: and, in practise, ..\nteacher: Yes, it's a spelling mistake and my correction over it))\nteacher: Well, actually, it's 'in practice'\nteacher: practise is a verb, in Canadian and British English, but never a noun\nteacher: practice is the noun\nteacher: practice can be a verb in US English too!\nstudent: Oh...wow, I didn't know this!\nteacher: Yes, it's confusing))\nteacher: I suppose the US way is the simplest, but there's a distinction in British English\nstudent: Is the expression 'in practice' correct to mean 'to sum it up'\nstudent: maybe sum it up is not an equivalent expression...\nstudent: what I wanted to say is something like 'in a few words' 'in the shortest way possible to say it'\nteacher: No, you can see it yourself I think, they are not the same and 'to sum it up' actually works better here\nteacher: you can also say 'essentially'\nstudent: essentialy is definitely better\nteacher: If you distill the chapter to the essence, it argues in favour of atheism\nstudent: I see...in practice I had to use essentially...oh, I am pretty sure this is a very common mistake for me\nteacher: #NAME?\nteacher: Lots of modern gadgets claim to be intuitive, but in practice, they can take up to an hour to set up\nstudent: It was a bit more radical than arguing in favour of atheism...it argued that anything but atheism is essentially dumb\nteacher: in practice = what happens in real life; practice vs. theory\nteacher: Ok, good use of 'essentially'!\nteacher: the problems regarding the idea of 'omnipotence'\nstudent: Oh that is definitely unclear...hmm..\nteacher: Ok, for brevity, I would also simplify this structure\nteacher: yes, you can see it\nteacher: it explores the idea of omnipotence?\nstudent: No, not really...to be clear I don't think you can simplify but must explain...\nstudent: it described the logical inconsistencies following from the definition of 'omnipotence'\nteacher: That's actually much clearer than the problems with the idea of...\nstudent: I agree...I can understand its meaning only because I still remember some parts of the book...\nteacher: Yes, but now I can also see what the author was trying to do there\nteacher: I wonder now though whether you even need 'to sum up'\nteacher: because the argument for atheism is not a summary of the criticism for omnipotence even though they are logically connected\nteacher: What do you think?\nstudent: it describes the logical inconsistencies following from the definition of 'omnipotence', and concludes that anything but atheism is essentially dumb\nstudent: maybe 'dumb' doesn't fit the style of the sentence, but I guess this would be a better rewriting of the sentence.\nteacher: I was just going to say that :)\nteacher: about 'dumb', completely different register\nstudent: obtuse\nteacher: You also need to keep it in one tense (concludes not concluded?)\nstudent: but I don't know if you can use it this way\nstudent: oh yes, you are right...concludes\nteacher: Haha, let me think\nteacher: Obtuse can be used in this meaning and does sound more formal, but it's still a bit abrupt\nteacher: what are the euphemisms for stupid?\nteacher: ill-informed?\nstudent: maybe\nteacher: unfounded might be a good one, for a belief\nstudent: yes, maybe unfounded would be more appropriate\nstudent: or credulous... is this a word?\nstudent: yes, it is...maybe it could be used in this context\nteacher: yes, credulous means the same as gullible\nteacher: I can see that in this context, yes\nteacher: misguided maybe\nteacher: All good options, to keep it from sounding too blunt\nteacher: Ok, moving on!\nteacher: I would be fine with this, if the problem of 'nature intelligibility' was treated better  and there weren't long sections about  'science fiction' (or better, theories which we shall never be able to prove).\nstudent: Okay for misguided...with this next sentence...hmmm\nteacher: an article / chapter / section ___ science fiction (what's the preposition?)\nstudent: on\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: Ok, as a reader, I'm not at all sure what you mean by 'treated better'\nstudent: that's because of Italian...\nteacher: Could you decipher it for me, please?\nstudent: explained better\nstudent: even though I can't remember exactly what the book meant with the intelligibility of nature...\nteacher: ok, or 'explored in more detail' maybe, as an option\nstudent: yes\nstudent: Even though, looking at it now, it makes little sense for a review reader to read the name of a concept\nstudent: which is not known unless you read the book (or you already know about the topic).\nstudent: So I would probably rewrite everything in a simpler way:\nteacher: Ok, with the science fiction, I'm not sure whether this is the term the author uses or whether this is your critisicm of his ideas\nstudent: Yes, also that part is unclear...\nstudent: Now I would re-write the sentence in a different way, for example:\nteacher: Oh, it's a philosophical / theological concept, so I'm sure the term can remain\nstudent: I believe the problem of 'nature intelligibility' wasn't explored in enough detail. At the same time, I believe the book devoted too many pages to theories which, while interesting, can't be proved through experiments and are thus more akin to 'science fiction' than to 'science'.\nstudent: Maybe I could avoid the repetition of 'believe', but writing in good English is not an easy task.\nteacher: No, it's not! This is a great improvement though!\nteacher: did you mean 'kin', not 'keen'?\nteacher: or\nteacher: akin\nteacher: akin to\nstudent: akin to\nstudent: it is an expression I don't use that often so I wasn't really sure about its spelling\nteacher: Sure\nteacher: now, akin to = similar to\nteacher: are they similar to science fiction or are they actually science fiction?\nstudent: similar to...even though it wouldn't be the correct term...\nteacher: No, that's the problem\nteacher: I believe the book devoted too many pages to theories which, while interesting, can't be proved through experiment and thus belong in the realm of science fiction, not science.\nteacher: just an option, more of an idea of 'being classified as' or 'belonging' than similarity\nstudent: indeed\nstudent: would\nteacher: I did like some of your sentences today! Complex but clear!\nstudent: belong more to the realm of science fiction than to the one of science\nstudent: thank you!\nteacher: My pleasure\nstudent: what is the difference between 'belong to the realm' and 'belong in the realm of'?\nstudent: are they both correct?\nteacher: Have a lovely week, looking forward to speaking to you next Tuesday! (same time, right?)\nteacher: I think they're both good!\nteacher: belong goes with to, as you know\nteacher: but also, belong (where)\nstudent: I see...\nteacher: as in 'you don't belong here'\nstudent: Okay, perfect thank you!\nstudent: It's already 14:03\nteacher: Yes, I'll let you go! Speak to you next week\nstudent: Great! Thank you for your help and have a nice week!!\nteacher: You're very welcome, bye!\nstudent: Bye!",
    "student: hi\nteacher: Hi Sophia Thompson!\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: I am fine\nstudent: and you?\nteacher: Is there a story behind your nickname?\nstudent: nah\nstudent: just snake\nteacher: All good, thank you.

Do you think it's possible to be ambitious and humble at the same time?\nstudent: I don't really know\nteacher: I think they are not opposites. It's possible to want to achieve something in life but also not talk all the time about how good and smart you are and remember the people and cicumstances that helped you\nteacher: What do you think?\nstudent: yeah\nstudent: I agree\nteacher: Ok then :)\nteacher: what's the word for something that happens every year? a.....\nteacher: if you don't remember, just say so\nstudent: yeah\nteacher: annual\nteacher: can you think of something that happens annually?\nteacher: my example: Christmas is an annual holiday\nstudent: Easter\nstudent: 43898.0\nteacher: ok, give me a full sentence please!\nstudent: Easter and the 8th of March are annual holidays\nteacher: Yes, good!\nteacher: Ok, and what was the adjective that means 'having the same status / opportunities / rights'?\nstudent: mmm\nteacher: equal\nteacher: and the noun is equality\nteacher: we were talking about gender equality last time, the idea that people of all genders should have the same opportunities and rights\nteacher: It can also be used in math, as a verb. Two plus two equals 4\nteacher: Are you with me, Sophia Thompson?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Ok, let's move on then!\nteacher: I've prepared a couple of idioms for you for today\nteacher: Do you know what an idiom is?\nstudent: something's on my mind\nteacher: is it an example?\nstudent: no\nteacher: Oh, ok, what's on your mind then?\nstudent: about idioms\nstudent: on the tip of my tongue\nteacher: is it on the tip of your tongue? you almost remember it?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: on my mind' is a good example of an idiom\nstudent: oh\nstudent: hahaha\nteacher: a group of words in a fixed order that have a particular meaning that is different from the meanings of each word on its own\nteacher: this is a dictionary definition of an idiom\nteacher: some of the idioms we learned before were 'up my street' or 'my cup of tea'\nteacher: what do they mean, by the way?\nstudent: something that you like\nteacher: Yes, that's right!\nteacher: I have two guinea pigs.' Every word in this sentence works to make the meaning\nteacher: but 'up my street' doesn't make sense in the same way because I'm not really talking about a street here\nteacher: Can you think of any other idioms in English? or maybe in other languages that you know?\nstudent: my cup of coffee\nstudent: coffee *\nteacher: what does this idiom mean?\nstudent: same as my cup of tea\nteacher: hmmm, I'm not sure about that!\nteacher: I think it's just 'my cup of tea', not coffee!\nteacher: My cup of coffee just means my cup of coffee, it doesn't have an idiomatic meaning\nteacher: Ok, I'll give you an idiom and you try to guess what it means, ok?\nteacher: a leopard can't change its spots\nteacher: what do you think it means?\nstudent: no\nstudent: I don't know\nteacher: that's ok, but what do you THINK\nstudent: I don't know 'spot'\nstudent: so I can't think)\nteacher: oh, you know a leopard is yellow but there are black spots too?\nstudent: oh\nstudent: yeah\nteacher: a giraffe has brown spots\nteacher: etc.\nteacher: ok, what do you think now?\nstudent: it means you can't change anything about smth\nstudent: it is a fact\nstudent: yes?\nteacher: hmm, interesting idea, but not quite\u00ac\nteacher: watch this and let me know, ok?\nstudent: I can't open it\nteacher: oh sorry, I'll send it to you on Skype\nteacher: there you go!\nstudent: Okay\nstudent: I am here\nstudent: I watched\nteacher: Ok, so what does it mean?\nstudent: when a person has a bad habit and it won't change\nstudent: He or she will always be the same person and their bad habits are here to stay.\nteacher: Yes, that's right! To say that a person will never change\nteacher: Do you think this is true? Do we ever change?\nstudent: yes\nstudent: sometimes we change\nteacher: Ok, can you give me a nice long answer, please?\nstudent: but it is not easy\nstudent: so some people try to change, and other people just do nothing\nteacher: Ok, what needs to happen for the person to change?\nstudent: So I think it is half true\nstudent: for example\nstudent: you have a bad habit\nstudent: and a person it doing everything to get rid of that habit\nteacher: I agree with you, it's half true!\nteacher: People can change if they want to (and sometimes they change no matter whether they want to or not), but some things stick with us!\nteacher: for example, it's hard to change our temparament\nteacher: *temperament, sorry\nteacher: Ok, what about an expression 'every cloud has a silver lining'?

Is there even a temptation?\nstudent: It goes like 'they only give you Black Friday, we give you Black week starting from Nov 23\nteacher: It's the same here, it's been 'black' for a fortnight now I think\nteacher: haha, yep\nstudent: and then they make the usual 20 per cent discount\nteacher: basically)) same prices, different tags\nstudent: yes!\nstudent: I never liked the idea of this type of shopping frenzy\nteacher: I was going to be strong and disdainful this year, but my favourite nursery dropped prices on fruit trees\nteacher: and that's more than I can handle!\nstudent: but at least in America you do get a chance to hunt for a great bargain or deal\nstudent: So you succumbed to the frenzy?\nteacher: I'm afraid I'm going to! I need a plum tree, a Morello cherry and another apple :)\nstudent: wow\nstudent: what is a Morello cherry?\nteacher: Oh, it's a Ukrianian-style sour cherry\nstudent: I see\nteacher: because all cherries here are sweet, the Morello one is the only sour one\nstudent: and what do they call our sweet cherries?\nteacher: and you can't get sour cherries for love or money!\nteacher: just cherries!\nteacher: a cherry for an English person is a sweet cherry\nstudent: do you need them for recipes? or you just like the sour taste?\nstudent: haha\nstudent: little do they know about cherries\nteacher: I just love them in every form, but especially as a vareniki filling!\nstudent: right\nteacher: Exactly!

I'm the crazy gardener in the household\nstudent: He must like the vareniki\nstudent: That come with it\nteacher: But I'm trying to lure Emily to the dark side\nstudent: ahahaha\nteacher: Yes, the deal is I grow stuff and he cooks it :)\nstudent: perfect!\nstudent: it's even better than 'I cook, you clean'\nteacher: Definitely! Even though there's a bit of that too )))\nstudent: Does Emily do the cleaning? ))))\nteacher: But, to be perfectly honest, I'm mainly growing for the thrill of it. The harvests are lovely but they are kind of a bonus\nteacher: Not really))) He does help a little, we try to share chores\nteacher: especially the ____ harvest (really big ones)\nstudent: bumper\nteacher: yes!))\nteacher: Oh, I've emailed you a present :)\nstudent: You enjoy watching it grow and blossom, don't you?\nteacher: Could you have a look, please?\nstudent: I'll check\nstudent: one sec\nteacher: Yes! and just being in the garden in the summer, picking a berry there and a cucumber here.

I had time to learn something about my PHD exam.\nteacher: That's good!\nteacher: The UK is preparing for the festive season even though we are in a lockdown. Everyone's talking about Christmas! But I guess the festive season for you is not until February, is it?\nstudent: What does 'a festive season' mean?\nteacher: festive = connected to celebration, in this case the celebration of Christmas and New Year\nteacher: a festive season (end of December in the UK), festive decorations, festive food, festive spirit etc.\nstudent: Oh, I know.\nteacher: festive = adjective; festival = noun\nstudent: Yes. The Chinese New Year is a little later than the New Year in the UK\nteacher: Yes, I know! I really liked the New Year in Shanghai because it felt like spring\nstudent: Yes. In China, we have an old calender.\nteacher: Ok, I thought it would be a good idea for us to practice future forms today. Could you tell me about your plans for the weekend please?\nteacher: just to practise\nstudent: OK.\nstudent: On Saturday morning, I'm going boxing in a club.\nstudent: The class takes about an hour.\nteacher: Ok, I didn't know you do boxing!\nstudent: It's for building my body.\nstudent: Because when I am at work, my neck often hurts.\nteacher: Yes, it's good exercise!\nteacher: Oh, sorry to hear that!\nteacher: Is this in the present? When I __ at work, my neck often ___\nstudent: Yes. When I am at work, my neck often hurts.\nteacher: Yes, that's much better :) perfect grammar this time\nstudent: At a Chinese Internet company, we often sit all day.\nteacher: I can imagine!\nteacher: Have you got any other plans for the weekend? Or anything you hope to do?\nstudent: Yes. On Saturday afternoon, I'm going to my favorite bookshop to read books.\nteacher: Nice!\nteacher: It's 'on' with days of the week and parts of days of the week\nteacher: on Saturday morning / afternoon\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: Anything else? :)\nstudent: About 0:00 on Sunday, if there is a great football game on, I will watch it.\nstudent: Sorry, do we always use 'on' with days of the week?\nteacher: Yes!\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: Days of the week and all expressions with 'day' such as birthday, Christmas day etc.\nteacher: on my birthday, on Sunday, on Saturday morning etc.\nteacher: On Sunday, if there __ a great football game on, I will watch it\nstudent: I like to watch football games like the Premier League on Saturday night.\nteacher: I remember, you love football!\nstudent: if there is\nteacher: Yes, correct!\nteacher: Ok, thanks for sharing! Let's have another look at these sentences and future forms\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: In the future, we sometimes talk about things that happen according to a schedule / timetable\nteacher: For example, there is a football match on TV on Saturday night\nteacher: It's in the future, but it's a timetable, so we use Present Simple here\nteacher: Another example: My train leaves tomorrow at 2 pm\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: Let's practise this. What time do you start work tomorrow?\nstudent: I start work at 9 am tomorrow.\nteacher: Yes, great. Our next lesson is on Monday\nteacher: It's in the future, but it's all Present Simple because it's a schedule\nstudent: OK. I understand.\nteacher: Ok, moving on! In the future we also have plans. Present continuous and 'be going to V' are both good ways to talk about our plans\nteacher: For example, this weekend I'm going to put up Christmas decorations with my son\nteacher: It's my plan.\nteacher: Or I could say, I'm putting on Christmas decorations with my son (Present Continuous)\nteacher: And your plan is to go to the book shop, right? Could you make a sentence about that?\nstudent: OK. But do these two types of sentences have the same meaning?\nstudent: these\nteacher: Yes, they have pretty much the same meaning. They both describe my plans for the future\nstudent: I am going to the book shop this week.\nteacher: Yes, lovely!\nstudent: I am going to watch a football game this weekend.\nteacher: Very good, yes!\nteacher: What about your boxing class? Is it more of a plan or more of a schedule, what do you think?\nstudent: It's a schedule, because it's a class and it has an exact time.\nstudent: has\nteacher: I agree with you!\nteacher: So what would be your sentence about the boxing club?\nstudent: I go to the boxing class at 10:00 on Saturday.\nteacher: Yes, lovely!\nteacher: Ok, now let's have a look at 'will'\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: We use 'will' to talk about what we hope / promise / want to happen in the future or what we think will happen in the future\nteacher: but it's not a plan or a schedule\nteacher: or what we've just decided to do\nteacher: For example, I'm cold, I'll go get a jumper\nteacher: It's not a plan or a schedule, I've just decided to go get a jumper = will\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: or, I hope Christmas will be fun!\nstudent: I hope I will have a good future.\nteacher: I hope we will be able to fix the environmental problems\nteacher: Yes, good example!\nteacher: Or, I promise I'll come to your party!\nteacher: I'll pay your the money back tomorrow\nteacher: I'll love you forever\nteacher: and other promises :)\nteacher: I hope it won't rain tomorrow (won't = will not)\nstudent: Is there a type like 'promised to do something'?\nteacher: Hmm, what do you mean?\nstudent: I promised I would do something yesterday\nstudent: Is it right?\nteacher: I'm thinking about this one. How can you promise to do something in the past?\nteacher: If you're talking about something you promised to do in the past, you can say, 'I promised I would help him yesterday' for example\nstudent: Yes.\nteacher: You take 'I promise I will help him' and put it into the past tense\nteacher: promise - promised\nteacher: will - would\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: I promised I would help him\nteacher: Is this what you had in mind?\nstudent: Yes.\nteacher: Great!\nteacher: Ok, one last bit. We don't really use 'will' after 'when' or 'if' even if we talk about the future\nteacher: We use the Present Tense insted\nteacher: instead\nteacher: When the rain stops, I will go out.\nteacher: When Present Simple, I will...\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: If I win a lottery, I will travel around the world\nteacher: When the pandemic stops, we will see our family and friends\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: When I _____ to Shanghai, I ___ ___ at Fudon University\nteacher: *Fudan, sorry\nstudent: When I go to Shanghai, I will be at Fudan University.\nteacher: Yes, good!\nteacher: Could you make some more sentences like this about your move to Shanghai, please?\nstudent: When I go to Shanghai, I will go to see my Professor.\nteacher: Yes, good!\nteacher: How do you think your life will be different when you live in Shanghai?\nstudent: When I pass my exams, I will have an opportunity to join the lab.\nteacher: Yes, good!\nstudent: When I go to Shanghai, I will give my attention to research work.\nteacher: Yes, 'I will give my attention to research work' or 'I'll focus on research work'\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: Do you you will be eating different food there? Experiencing different weather?\nstudent: Yes. When I go to Shanghai, I will be eating different food there.\nteacher: *sorry, Do you think\nteacher: Like the dumplings))\nstudent: Dumplings are the northern food.\nteacher: Oh really?\nteacher: I thought there were some kind of dumplings that are specific to Shaghai\nteacher: Hmm, maybe I'm wrong about that!\nteacher: These tiny steamed dumplings with a meat filling? I forgot what they are called, unfortunately!\nteacher: But they are delicious\nstudent: Xiao long bao\nteacher: That's it! Probably!\nteacher: I mean, I'm sure you're right :)\nteacher: There is one place in Cambridge where you can buy them but they are not as good as in Shanghai :)\nteacher: Anyway, I'll let you go! I've emailed you some homework, a bit more on future forms + some exercises\nstudent: Oh. So Chinese food is also famous in the UK.\nteacher: Enjoy your weekend, I'll speak to you on Monday!\nstudent: OK. Thanks again.\nteacher: Yes, but it's mainly Cantonese food here, to be honest\nteacher: My pleasure :)\nstudent: Cantonese food is really Hong Kong food.",

But I cook lots of Ukrainian food on New Year, and sometimes we watch a Soviet movie, subtitled\nstudent: Actually, it's ok, because now she knows about Saint Nicholas day and New Year\nteacher: But I'm careful about this now\nstudent: ))\nteacher: We watched 'The Irony of Fate' a couple of years ago\nstudent: Actually yesterday I had a funny picture from Daniel\nteacher: I'm not sure it's the best translation, do you know what I mean?\nteacher: And I didn't like it!\nstudent: About Irony Sudby\nteacher: Oh, like a meme?\nstudent: The Irony of Fate' sure!\nstudent: Ok\nstudent: It's something like\nstudent: Have you noticed that the teacher of Russian said, 'I need odet'my new dress'?\nstudent: sorry\nstudent: I need 'odet'\nstudent: )))\nteacher: True!!! I've noticed that before!!\nstudent: I think me too\nstudent: But it's really funny )\nteacher: It is!\nteacher: I really didn't like it last time, it's so sexist!\nstudent: Yes\nstudent: And about the translation\nstudent: I completely agree with you\nteacher: Like, the protagonist is telling Nadya that she is basically a failure because she didn't get married by 34\nstudent: it's so strange\nteacher: And she agrees!\nstudent: Yes\nstudent: And I know that lots of people don't like the movie because of Zhenya\nstudent: He doesn't look like a hero )\nstudent: But for me he is ok\nteacher: Well, he is nice, he is supposed to be an 'intelligent'\nstudent: He is just a 'usual person' )\nteacher: But, for example, she asks him to leave several times and he just refuses!\nstudent: a 'usual person'\nteacher: This is really weird\nstudent: Yes! Agree\nteacher: Good correction, you need an article there, but it's actually 'a'\nstudent: Especially now lots of things in the movie aren't ok\nteacher: a usual person\nteacher: \u02c8ju\u02d0.\u0292u.\u0259l\nteacher: because it actually starts with a consonant /j/\nstudent: Here in Ukraine we haven't watched those movies since 2014 I think\nstudent: because it actually starts with a consonant /j/  - ok! Thank you It's clear!\nteacher: I ___ ____ it for years until I watched it with Mark Smith two years ago (not watch)\nteacher: what tense do you think goes here?\nstudent: At first we had a ban on Soviet movies on TV\nteacher: Oh, I didn't know that! Because I don't watch TV I suppose\nstudent: I hadn't watched it for years until I watched it with Mark Smith two years ago (not watch)\nstudent: sorry\nstudent: hadn't watched\nteacher: Yes, well done! :)\nteacher: nice Past Perfect\nstudent: Neither do we\nstudent: We don't have a TV at home\nteacher: We have a TV but only for streaming services))\nstudent: But I mean that because of the ban lots of people who watched that stuff just stopped watching it\nteacher: As much as I love to chat, let's have a look at your homework! Well done you for doing extra homework, by the way!\nteacher: Ah, it worked then, the ban\nstudent: yes!\nstudent: thank you )\nteacher: I think it's important, to stop doing the same stuff as people across the border\nstudent: yes\nstudent: Sorry one more thing\nteacher: Go on!\nstudent: I've just remembered it\nstudent: My student Sophia Chen has sent me a link to watch a very interesting lecture about Ukrainian\nstudent: I can send you that one\nteacher: Ooh, thank you, I'd love that!\nteacher: Could you send it to me on Messenger?\nstudent: Sure\nteacher: later on)\nteacher: Ok!\nteacher: Hello Mrs. Taylor,  Thank you for your interest to our school.

Best regards, Sarah from EcoTech Innovations Team\nstudent: Ok! Sorry! Let's start )\nteacher: No worries\nteacher: Ah, it's annoying that there is no formatting in this chat\nstudent: Yes! )\nteacher: Very good and the message is clear!\nteacher: Let's look at some bits that are wrong\nstudent: ok!\nteacher: when we compare two things with an adjective, we use (not) as ... as\nteacher: LOL stuff is as expensive as Lego\nteacher: or 'not as expensive as Lego'\nstudent: ok\nteacher: So you know what to do with ' our teachers as much experienced as students\u2019 needs oriented'\nteacher: :)\nstudent: hm\nstudent: without much?\nteacher: Yes, that's right!\nstudent: Ok\nstudent: it's funny\nteacher: But they still are as much effective as the lessons at school\nstudent: at first I've wrote it like that\nteacher: and same here)\nstudent: as effective as the lessons at school\nteacher: Yes!\nstudent: they still are\nstudent: or they are still\nstudent: ?\nteacher: they are still\nstudent: sure!\nstudent: Ok\nstudent: And one more question\nteacher: Yes, of course!\nstudent: as much doesn't make any sense?\nteacher: It does! I'm thinking of an example\nstudent: ok )\nteacher: I have as much milk as yogurt\nteacher: milk and yogurt are uncountable nounds, so they work with much\nteacher: he has as much money as I do\nteacher: but!\nteacher: Teacher X has as many students as teacher Y.\nteacher: because students are countable\nstudent: ok\nteacher: *nouns\nstudent: but I can't use it with abstract things\nstudent: like experience\nstudent: or student-oriented )\nteacher: You can! I have as much love for my niece as for my nephew))\nteacher: a bit of a silly sentence\nstudent: ok\nteacher: I have so much more love for strawberries than for onions))\nteacher: but you don't need 'much' with an adjective in an 'as...as' comparison\nstudent: Ah! Ok\nteacher: Ah, I think I know where the confusion is coming from!\nteacher: Online lessons are much more effective than face-to-face\nstudent: So I need much when I talk about nouns\nteacher: you can 'much' to modify 'more' in this structure\nstudent: Ahh\nteacher: or 'less'\nstudent: sure\nteacher: much more / much less\nstudent: much more!\nteacher: much more expensive\nteacher: Yes!\nstudent: thank you\nstudent: it's clear now\nteacher: While we are on this topic, you can also use 'twice / half / three times' etc. with as... as\nstudent: sure\nstudent: thank you\nstudent: I've forgotten this stuff unfortunately\nstudent: But now it's better )\nteacher: If LOL dolls are 20 pounds but Lego is 10 pounds, LOL dolls are twice as expensive as Lego\nteacher: and Lego is half as expensive as LOL\nteacher: No worries, I'll send you some exercises to practise at home\nstudent: Maybe I need some homework for practising this stuff )\nstudent: Oh, Thank you )\nteacher: Houses in Cambridge are twice as expensive as in March :)\nstudent: )\nteacher: or even 'three times'\nstudent: But you have a garden )\nteacher: Exactly! A garden that is three times as big as in one of those new Cambridge houses)))\nstudent: )))\nteacher: Ok, let's see what else we've got time for!\nteacher: Oh, the very first sentence, Thanks for your interest IN our school\nstudent: You are an expert in making examples )\nstudent: interest for\nstudent: ?\nteacher: interest in!\nteacher: same as 'interested in'\nstudent: Ah! Yes/ Sorry )\nteacher: I'm interested in insects\nteacher: or something like that\nteacher: (I'm not!)\nstudent: haha\nstudent: me neither\nteacher: Oh, and a quick one on saying how long things take\nteacher: if you're using one-hour as an adjective, you need a hyphen - - -\nteacher: one-hour\nteacher: that little '-' is a hypen\nstudent: ok!\nteacher: Also, in an adjective of this kind, all words are singular\nteacher: The lesson is 30 minutes. But! It's a 30-minute lesson\nteacher: We lose the 's' and add a '-'\nteacher: Same with distances. A 5-mile walk\nstudent: ok!\nstudent: I see!\nteacher: Ah, I'm afraid that's all we have time for today!

That's not very good!\nstudent: just to have fun\nstudent: I finally washed my hair\nstudent: my mom is going to call his parents\nstudent: and another boy\nstudent: ma\nstudent: made a hole\nstudent: the top of the room-?\nstudent: I don't know the word\nteacher: in the roof?\nteacher: the ceiling?\nteacher: how did he do that?\nstudent: yes\nstudent: he threw a bottle up\nstudent: and the ceiling is easy to break\nstudent: so there was a hole\nteacher: Wow, yes, your class is indeed in a bit of a chaos!\nteacher: Haven't you got a substitute teacher?\nstudent: and they somehow spilled yoghurt on the ceiling\nstudent: if it is a class teacher than no\nteacher: I see!

Despite the fact that people say, 'a leopard ____ ____ ____ ___'\nstudent: can't change it spots\nteacher: Yes, well done!\nteacher: What about you? Do you like getting up early?\nstudent: NO\nstudent: never\nteacher: :))))\nteacher: Ok, have you had a chance to write a story about the fact that every cloud has a silver lining?\nstudent: yes\nstudent: In every bad situation we should try to find smth good. It will always help us. When you feel sad, try to find something nice about it or do something nice for yourself)\nteacher: Ok, that's good advice, thank you!\nteacher: Do you manage to practise this?\nstudent: what do you mean?\nteacher: I mean, do you try to find something good in each situation?\nstudent: no\nstudent: I don't think so\nteacher: Ok, go on\nstudent: it helps a lot of people\nstudent: without to*\nteacher: yes, good correction, I was just typing that :)\nstudent: but not me\nteacher: I actually agree with you!\nteacher: I think, if something really bad happens, it's much healthier to be properly sad about it than to try and look for a silver lining\nteacher: Oh, how is your business?\nstudent: we want to do Black Friday at our shop\nteacher: oooh, nice!\nteacher: it's today, right?\nteacher: Black Friday\nstudent: yeah\nteacher: Let's revise our business words!\nteacher: If you cover your costs and earn extra money, you.....\nstudent: um(\nteacher: make a ....\nteacher: profit\nstudent: yes\nteacher: and if you don't cover your costs, you .....\nstudent: make a loss\nteacher: nearly, make a loss\nstudent: typo!!!\nteacher: and if you don't make either a profit or a loss and just cover your costs, you break ....\nteacher: ok)\nstudent: through\nstudent: oy\nteacher: nope, you break even))\nstudent: even\nstudent: yeah\nteacher: yes, you remember)\nstudent: you were first )\nteacher: and all the money you earn is r......\nstudent: revenue\nteacher: yes, well done!\nteacher: you remember the difficult word))\nteacher: Ok, now something I've prepared for today!\nteacher: What kind of music do you like, Sophia?\nstudent: oh\nstudent: some pop\nstudent: but smth like 'Baby baby baby oooh'\nstudent: oooh\nstudent: oy\nstudent: oooh\nstudent: or some indie-rock\nteacher: ok, I think I got the idea))) do you like something like it?\nteacher: Ok!\nteacher: what about hip hop?\nstudent: I don't know the types\nstudent: *types\nteacher: that's ok\nstudent: just music)\nteacher: Ok!\nteacher: I've found a piece on the BBC about this superstar rapper from Namibia\nteacher: You know 'a rapper'?\nstudent: of course\nteacher: sure))\nteacher: But can you guess her day job? She is a rapper and also a ....\nstudent: teacher?)\nteacher: no!\nstudent: hmmm\nteacher: well, no worries, you'll find out in a minute!\nteacher: Just a few words before you watch it\nteacher: a teacher, a doctor, a postman - all these people do essential jobs, they can't work from home and they keep working even during a pandemic / lockdown\nteacher: In the UK, they are called 'key workers'\nteacher: people who do very important work that keeps us all going\nteacher: Can you think of any other examples of key workers?\nstudent: security\nteacher: yes, sure\nteacher: Ok! Some key workers like doctors have to work 24/7, but, of course, one person can't do it, so they take turns\nteacher: some work in the morning, some at night\nteacher: These different times when people work are called 'shifts'\nteacher: People can work a night shift (work at night)\nteacher: or work a 24-hour shift\nteacher: or work double shifts, two together\nteacher: Do you know anyone who works shifts?\nstudent: hm\nstudent: security )))\nteacher: Yes, definitely))\nteacher: Firefighters, nursers, doctors, supermarket staff etc., right?\nteacher: Ok!

She is actually super successful!\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Do you think this story about her was recorded a long time ago? Or about now?\nstudent: I think it is about now\nteacher: Why do you think so?\nstudent: making music is her hobby\nteacher: Ok, but why do you think the story is about now?\nstudent: I think every person who is making music now will always feel music in his or her heart\nteacher: Oh yes, that's true! What I was talking about is that as a doctor she talks about he coronavirus pandemic, right?\nteacher: So it's got to be 2020!\nstudent: maybe the topic is that no matter who you are and whatever your job is, you can have a hobby that doesn't depend on your job\nteacher: Yes, that's a good idea to take from this!\nstudent: right\nteacher: Ok, Sophia, thank you, I'll let you go unwind and play Minecraft with your friend!\nstudent: thanks\nstudent: goodbye\nteacher: Have a lovely weekend, bye!\nstudent: have a nice weekend\nteacher: Thanks)\nteacher: Thanks)",
    "teacher: Hi Emma Smith!\nstudent: Hello, Mrs. Rodriguez.\nstudent: Nice to meet you!\nteacher: Hi, nice to speak to you again :)\nteacher: We only really say 'nice to meet you' the first time we meet a person. After that, it's 'nice to see you' or 'nice to speak to you' (over the phone / chat, if you don't really see the person)\nteacher: Did you have a good weekend? Was there a good game on?\nstudent: OK. Nice to speak to you too.\nteacher: lovely, nice to speak to you too :)\nstudent: Yes. There was a game on Saturday, but I had some work to do, so I didn't watch the live game.\nteacher: Oh, that's a shame!\nteacher: There ___ a game ___ Saturday\nteacher: What goes in the gaps?\nstudent: There was a game on Saturday.\nteacher: Yes, well done!\nteacher: And did you find anything interesting in the bookshop?\nstudent: I took my own books to the bookshop.\nteacher: Oh really? Why?\nstudent: There is a coffee house. I often go to the coffee house to read books.\nteacher: Oh, sounds really nice!\nteacher: What are you reading at the moment?\nstudent: People can read their own books, and they can also read the books in the bookshop.\nteacher: Your bookshop sounds like a lovely place\nstudent: I'm reading a mathemathical  book about machine learning.\nteacher: Ok! I wouldn't be able to read a book like this :)\nstudent: In China, bookshops always have a coffee house to let people have a good time reading.\nteacher: I had a nice weekend. My son and I decorated a Christmas tree and watched a Christmas movie and my husband made some lovely food\nteacher: What a good idea! I've realized I probably never went to a proper bookshop like this when we lived in Shanghai, because I don't speak Chinese\nstudent: Sounds great!\nteacher: But we enjoyed a local DVD shop there :)\nteacher: Ok, Emma Smith, shall we have a look at B2 Writing part 2?\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: The word count for Part 2 is the same as for Part 1 (140-190 words), but you can choose your task out of 3 options\nteacher: All tasks in part 2 are imaginary / pretend situations. For example, write an article for an English magazine or write to your English-speaking friend\nteacher: not a real magazine and not a real friend, just an imaginary situation\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: But, depending on the situation, your writing has to be a bit different. For example, if it's an email to a friend, you probably want to start with 'Hi &lt;Friend's name&gt;.'\nteacher: And end with 'Best wishes, Emma Smith'\nteacher: or something like that\nteacher: And if it's an article, you don't have to do any of these, you basically write an essay\nteacher: Just like in Part 1, it's important to answer all the questions that the task gives you\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: Have you got that pdf with writing tasks that I sent you earlier?\nstudent: Yes. I'm reading the questions.\nteacher: Lovely!\nteacher: As you can see, the choice is a book review, an article and an informal email (to a friend)\nstudent: Yes. So which one is better for me?\nteacher: Which one do you like best? I know you love books, but one thing to make sure of with a book review is being able to remember the name of the book, the characters and the author in English\nteacher: I think we might practise all of them, one at a time, if you'd like\nteacher: They are all very useful\nstudent: OK.\nstudent: I think I need some time to remember the names in the book. So the first time I think I will not choose the book review.\nteacher: Ok, very wise I think!\nteacher: An article or an email then?\nstudent: OK.\nstudent: An article.\nteacher: Ok, the most useful thing you have ever learned!\nteacher: What do you think this thing can be?\nstudent: Sorry. I don\u2019t have a clear idea about this topic.\nstudent: Some qualities? like honest, brave?\nteacher: No worries, let me give you an example.\nteacher: No, just a useful skill you learned\nteacher: For example, when I was at school, I learned to touch type (type without looking). This is one of the most useful skills that I've learned, it has saved me so much time because I can type very fast\nstudent: OK, I know.\nteacher: Or, when I was 4 years old, I learned to swim. It's one of the most useful things I've learned because when I fell in a pool I could swim out. Also, it means I enjoy seaside holidays\nteacher: cooking, starting a campfire, riding a bike - all useful skills\nteacher: Ok? What do you think?\nteacher: playing a musical instrument\nstudent: When I was at high school, I learned computer programming. This is one of the most useful skills that I've learned.\nteacher: Wonderful example, yes!\nteacher: You will need to explain why it's been so useful to you\nstudent: It helped me go deep in the computer world, and changed my life. Now I'm an engineer in a company.\nteacher: And then, in the next paragraph, answer the question, who you learned it from\nteacher: Yes, good!\nstudent: Is 'who' a real person or something like a website?\nteacher: a real person!\nteacher: if it was a website or school, it would be 'where did you learn it from'\nteacher: but if there was no real person, you can just describe how you learned it\nstudent: I learnt it from my elder borther who is a video game developer.\nteacher: Ok, lovely. We say 'elder brother'\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: because what's important here is not that he might be old, but that he is older than you\nteacher: and with brothers/sisters, we use 'elder' instead of 'older'\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: cool, is your brother still a video game developer?\nteacher: You can use the present tense if he is\nstudent: Yes.\nteacher: I learnt it from my elder brother, who is a video game developer.\nteacher: Lovely, could you say a bit about why it is a useful skill?\nstudent: During the process, he showed me how to use computer codes to build a virtual world. And the most important thing is that learning to code helped me get a good job.\nteacher: Ok, nice long sentences, a couple of problems here\nteacher: it showed me how...' What's 'it' in this sentence?\nteacher: Maybe, my brother showed me...?\nstudent: Yes. my brother showed me ...\nteacher: Yes, good!\nteacher: Ok, and could you put the second sentence in the past tense? What do you need to change?\nstudent: helps --&gt; helped\nteacher: Yes, well done!\nstudent: get --&gt; got?\nteacher: Yes, correct!\nteacher: And also, learning to code, you need the infinitive 'to code'\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: Some other things that might be good to write about are, how old you were when you learned to code, whether it was hard to learn, whether you liked or not\nteacher: things like that\nteacher: because you need a nice 140-190-word article :)\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: Would you like to try one more sentence?\nstudent: OK.\nstudent: I learnt to code when I was at high school. It was hard to start, because you need to let yourself think like a computer. But when my elder brother taught me how to use a computer language to build a tiny game, I thought I really liked these things, and I would be a coder in the future.\nteacher: This is excellent work, Emma Smith!\nstudent: Thanks.\nteacher: One small thing: I thought I really liked those things and I would be a coder in the future\nteacher: You need everything in the past\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: and maybe 'I really liked doing it' would be clearer than 'these things'\nstudent: Yes.\nteacher: Ok, lovely. As you can guess, the homework will be to write the whole article if you have the time. Feel free to use the sentences you wrote today!\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: Great! Have a nice week, I'll speak to you on Thursday!\nstudent: Thanks, I will do it tomorrow.\nstudent: OK. See you next time.\nteacher: Lovely, you can email it to me then.\nteacher: Bye!\nstudent: OK.\nstudent: Bye!",

One person works at night and another during the day etc.\nteacher: What is it called?\nstudent: shift\nteacher: Yes, well done! To do/ work shifts\nteacher: And another useful word from the video was 'monetise'\nteacher: She looks for ways to monetise her music\nteacher: What do you think it might mean?\nstudent: I know what it means\nstudent: making money from smth\nstudent: for example\nteacher: Yes, well done!\nstudent: my friend was making bracelets and jewellery\nstudent: and now she is making money from that\nteacher: Yes, this is the example  I was just going to give you)) you're monetising her hobby\nteacher: Ok, could you go back to the video (link in Skype) and watch it again, please?\nteacher: and let me know when you're ready\nstudent: I am here\nteacher: Lovely!\nteacher: Could you do the 'check your understanding' exercise? The purple tab under the video\nteacher: Who says it, the doctor or the Lioness?\nstudent: 44049.0\nteacher: Ok, do you see where you went wrong?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: cool\nstudent: do I need to do the next one?\nteacher: I find it interesting that she talks about how the pandemic will change us in the video\nteacher: Not now, thank you\nteacher: Do you think we will be changed forever by this experience in 2020? If so, in what way?\nstudent: some people will miss lockdowns\nstudent: and some people after hearing the word lockdown will run away:)\nteacher: Really? Interesting! In what way?\nteacher: Ah, do you mean some people actually enjoy lockdowns and others hate them?\nstudent: for example some students\nstudent: yes\nteacher: What about the students?\nstudent: like I want a lockdown )\nteacher: Ok, why is that?\nstudent: It is a bit easier to study,  I call my friends more often, I sleep more, I have a bit more free time than usual\nteacher: Oh I see! Yes, a strong argument for studying from home for you\nteacher: And you don't have to be the head girl :)\nteacher: I like working from the comfort of my home too. It also means I don't have to c...... (travel to work)\nstudent: I have to\nteacher: even when you study from home?\nstudent: my class teacher asks me 'does anyone skip lessons' and smth like that\nteacher: Oh I see!\nteacher: You still perform your duties :)\nteacher: Ok, Emily, thanks for today!\nstudent: thank you!\nteacher: The vocabulary exercise under the video will by your homework, ok?\nteacher: My pleasure!\nstudent: have a nice day!\nstudent: okie\nstudent: bye\nteacher: Have a nice afternoon too!\nteacher: Take care :)",
    "student: Hello Ms. Patel!\nstudent: Sorry for being late..again (\nteacher: Hi Emily Smith!\nteacher: No worries, life gets in the way)\nteacher: Are you ok?\nstudent: Yes! All good\nstudent: It took me forever to clean the car\nstudent: get rid of the snow\nstudent: Do you have snow yet?\nteacher: Oh wow! Has it been snowing so badly?\nteacher: God, no, we'll be lucky if we get 3 hours of snow like two years ago\nteacher: There was none at all last year!\nstudent: Not at all. But the snow slowly turned into ice and got glued to the car\nstudent: That's a shame! A snowless winter...\nteacher: Snow is actually forecast for tomorrow, everyone's excited, but I'm like, come on, it's also going to be +4\nstudent: hahahah\nteacher: I'm an expert on snow :))))) because I'm Ukrainian\nteacher: So I've taken it upon myself to manage people's expectations)))))\nteacher: I'm sure they love it when I do it))\nstudent: haha\nstudent: well, someone has to do it\nteacher: There's a weird belief in this country, when it gets below zero (infrequently), people say, well, it's too cold for snow\nteacher: It makes zero sense to me\nteacher: That's it, someone has to)))\nstudent: Is the verb 'forecast' used with 'to be'?\nteacher: Yes, like snow is forecast\nstudent: Those people probably have never been to snowy regions?\nstudent: Cool. Thanks\nteacher: That's it. I think it only properly snows in Scotland these days, because of the climate change\nteacher: Crazily, my friend's mum used to skate on the local river, all the way to Cambridge. Only 40 years ago or something like that\nteacher: But now the rivers don't even freeze over\nstudent: It's a pity. There should be snow in winter.\nstudent: wow\nstudent: What was the distance she covered?\nteacher: Let me think, maybe about 30 miles?\nstudent: almost 50 km wow\nteacher: I know! This is the legend I don't dare question :) Maybe she did it over three days, I don't know\nstudent: She must have had quite a motivation\nstudent: Maybe they sell better bread in Cambridge )))\nteacher: We'd like to visit Kyiv one day in the winter, actually. To show Emma some snow))\nteacher: There must have been something! :)))\nstudent: Oh yes! Emma's going to love it.\nteacher: Does Sophia love it?\nstudent: Yes. Except for the times it flies straight into her face\nteacher: :)))\nstudent: She spends 3+ hours outdoors\nstudent: half of that time she's asleep of course\nteacher: But snow is a disaster here. The government issues alerts, people try not ot travel. Trains come to a standstill\nteacher: Oh, that's so healthy!\nstudent: Yes, I heard! As in many other EU countries... a complete collapse\nteacher: Yes, it's weird :)\nteacher: Do you drive then?\nstudent: Yes, I do\nstudent: since 2007\nteacher: Good for you! Wow! You're an experienced driver!\nteacher: I've got to learn one day\nteacher: But I'm just waiting for self-driving cars :)\nstudent: Do you really have to though? Transport over there is so much better right?\nteacher: Nooo, public transport is awful! At least where we live, which is admittedly in the middle of nowhere\nteacher: A bus once an hour!\nstudent: noooo((\nteacher: But we live very close to the railway station and we've always relied on trains to get us to Cambridge and Peterborough, or London\nstudent: Does Michael Jones drive?\nteacher: And just cycle around the town\nteacher: Yes, he does, but we haven't got a car. We might have to buy one in the spring\nstudent: cycling is great! It's nice that you have that option\nteacher: But this country is built for motorists. Like, we can't even get to the coast by train, and many other interesting places are just out of reach\nteacher: So we hire a car a couple of times a year, for a bit of a staycation\nstudent: the land of Top Gear\nteacher: Yes, this place is ideal for cycling because it's so flat))\nteacher: Oh yes, Top Gear. It has a cult following, but I've never seen it\nteacher: I can't imagine it'd be my cup of tea)\nteacher: Do you like it?\nstudent: unlike Japan, for example. Trains are the only option\nteacher: Are they? It's a greener means of transport for sure\nstudent: Yes. It's fun to watch. Especially, their bits when they experiment\nstudent: I remember one episode with self-made houses on wheels\nstudent: I laughed so hard\nteacher: I see! So Sophia must be taking after her mother, in terms of her fascination with vehicles :)\nstudent: hahaha maybe. Still, Tommy is even more into cars\nteacher: Oh I see! cool! :)\nstudent: Now that they have new hosts, it's no longer as funny as it used to be\nteacher: Have they got rid of Jeremy...?\nteacher: Can't remember his last name\nstudent: yes\nteacher: What happened? Did he retire?\nstudent: I think the others left too.. with time\nstudent: No, they had had a huge scandal\nteacher: Oh, they have a new show though, don't they?\nstudent: yes, a separate one\nteacher: I see! I haven't been following, as you can see\nstudent: Jeremy and the producers didn't see eye to eye so to say\nstudent: I'm sure he is very bossy and hard to deal with\nteacher: Didn't he punch someone out?\nstudent: but what a sense of humour\nteacher: I vaguely remember the rumours\nteacher: Ah, maybe I'm missing out!\nstudent: Probably one of the producers, yes\nteacher: right :)) when words fail))\nstudent: )))))\nteacher: Ok, shall we delve back into some CPE stuff?\nstudent: I thought about the CPE exam. I'm now considering taking it at some point. Maybe in the spring\nteacher: Or I should say, C2 Proficiency\nteacher: Cambridge English have changed all names recently\nteacher: Exciting!!\nstudent: Yes, let's practise more\nteacher: Lovely, could you go to the pdf, please?\nstudent: OK\nteacher: page 5\nteacher: Power Naps\nteacher: In this one, you form the words that go in the gaps out of the ones given on the right\nstudent: Found it\nstudent: 5 mins?\nteacher: Obviously, you'll be thinking about which part of speech you need. But it's also important to check which meaning you need. You might have to use a negative prefix, or a suffix meaning the lack of something\nteacher: like -less\nteacher: Yes, sure!\nstudent: Got it\nteacher: Oh, another important thing, which form you need\nstudent: I'll be back when I'm done\nteacher: like singular / plural form of a noun etc\nteacher: ok\nstudent: 17) alertness (?)\nteacher: yes!\nstudent: 18) executives\nteacher: yes\nstudent: 19) maximize\nteacher: yes\nstudent: 20) disorientation\nteacher: yes, good)\nstudent: 21) comparatively\nteacher: yes\nstudent: 22) designated\nteacher: yes\nstudent: 23) accompany\nteacher: yes\nstudent: 24) dunno\nstudent: )))))\nteacher: ah, it's a tricky one\nstudent: desperation\nteacher: yes, that's right)))\nstudent: wow\nstudent: great\nteacher: while I was thinking which hint to give you)\nteacher: Yes, 100%\nstudent: Funny that I get to read about power naps\nteacher: Oh, sorry, despEration\nstudent: Oh sure. Sorry I was in a rush))\nteacher: a typo I know, but they'll take a point off for that in an actual exam\nstudent: Tonight I didn't sleep\nteacher: Oh no, why not?\nteacher: Sophia?\nstudent: Sophia had a blocked nose (?)\nteacher: a stuffy nose\nstudent: I forgot what you taught me\nstudent: Stuffy\nstudent: right!\nteacher: Oh, it's awful!\nstudent: Yes. It has been one hell of a night, actually\nteacher: a blocked nose collocated too, by the way\nteacher: Oh sorry to hear that! You must be drained\nstudent: Got it\nstudent: Strangely enough, I'm OK.. more or less\nteacher: Ok! Hope she feels better soon and you have a restful night tonight\nstudent: I really hope so too. It was emotionally difficult. Nothing I could do to help\nstudent: *It\nstudent: Thank you!\nteacher: I can imagine, and they get so cranky when they don't get enough sleep too!\nstudent: Oh yes.\nstudent: Irritated with everything\nteacher: Do you ever take power naps?\nstudent: Never. I can't fall asleep so easily\nstudent: Do you?\nteacher: I do! Well, not very often these days\nstudent: when Emma was little?\nteacher: But I learned to do it back at school\nteacher: Yes, definitely\nteacher: 20 minutes is usually enough\nstudent: wow! That's a skill I'd really like to master\nteacher: It's so good, and because it's only a short nap it doesn't disrupt your night sleep\nteacher: Shall we have a look at the next task? It's an interesting one\nstudent: Let's have a look, yes\nteacher: Sentence transformation. Feel free to use the words from the original sentence. You want to keep the meaning as close to the original as possible\nstudent: OK\nteacher: Have you ever tried a task like this?\nstudent: I think so, yes\nteacher: Ok, sure!\nteacher: Take your time\nstudent: Ok.\nstudent: 25) not sure about it but\nstudent: There is no point in telling how long it\nstudent: 8 words lol\nteacher: Ah, it's a different meaning though\nteacher: the meaning in the original is 'it's impossible' and in yours, 'it's pointless'\nstudent: There's a low (weak?) demand for\nteacher: Not quite\nteacher: Shall we take them one by one?\nstudent: so instead of 'point' we should use something else?\nteacher: yes!\nstudent: or the whole structure is false?\nteacher: instead of 'point in'\nstudent: no way of\nteacher: telling how long this' is right\nteacher: Yes!!\nstudent: yay\nteacher: Or simply 'There is no telling how long this...\nteacher: but also: no way / chance of telling\nstudent: I didn't know you could say it like that\nteacher: Ok, 26\nteacher: Yes, it's a collocation\nteacher: 26 is 'is little demand for / isn't a lot of demand for / isn't much demand for'\nstudent: There has been a decline in demand for\nstudent: ))))))\nteacher: I like it actually!\nstudent: One of my options was to go with the negative form\nteacher: Let me check, I don't think they give this option\nstudent: It's probably false\nteacher: Carry on, ok? I'll check this one\nstudent: OK\nstudent: sure\nstudent: 27) impressed with how good a negotiator\nstudent: 28) resignation came as a surprise to\nstudent: 29) There wasn't any vegetation whatsoever in\nteacher: 29 and 28 correct!\nteacher: 27, nearly. They give 'impressed with how skilled a negotiator\nteacher: skill becomes skilled\nteacher: I must admit, I also wrote good there\nstudent: 30) At the height of his career (success)\nteacher: But we should try to keep it as close to the original as possible\nstudent: Oh. So with 'good' it would have been marked as false?\nteacher: Yes, unfortunately!\nteacher: For the same reason, it's success, not career\nteacher: because it's 'successful' in the original\nstudent: Got it. Stay as close as possible to the original\nteacher: Yes, part of it is about getting the logic of the task!\nstudent: a challenging task but I like it\nstudent: it\nteacher: Basically, Cambridge writes answer keys and then hires a load of students who sit in a warehouse and check papers against the answer key. They don't see the questions or anything, and they won't go, well, this is close enough\nstudent: makes sense\nteacher: Yes, this is one of the most challenging tasks! I think each sentence carries two points\nstudent: otherwise it would have been a nightmare\nteacher: That's it, they have to standardize it.\nteacher: The writing and speaking are checked by real people\nteacher: I mean, Cambridge examiners))\nstudent: Like Michael Jones?\nteacher: students are real people too! :)))\nstudent: )))\nstudent: poor students\nteacher: He used to do it, yes! He used to be an examiner for CPE\nteacher: I know, that was pretty bad of me))))\nstudent: That's OK\nstudent: I laughed )\nteacher: It's because I was speculating that maybe they are actually checked by computers now but no, not yes, I think\nteacher: If you have the time, maybe do the reading part as homework? And we can check together next time\nstudent: OK! I'll try\nstudent: can't promise, though\nstudent: I'll also try to come on time\nteacher: No worries!\nstudent: Thank you Ms. Patel!\nstudent: Have a great day\nteacher: If you don't manage to do the reading, we can still find something useful to practise!\nteacher: You too! Bye! :)\nstudent: sure! always)\nstudent: bye!",
    "student: Hi, Ms. Patel!\nteacher: Hi Sarah Smith!\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: How are you doing?\nstudent: fine!\nteacher: All good, thank you!\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: Today we've been to the hospital with Elena\nteacher: Oh no! What's the matter?\nstudent: And my yoga teacher cancelled the lesson\nstudent: My news )\nstudent: We wanted to check if everything was ok with a pediatric gynecologist\nteacher: Oh I see! I didn't realize you have to go for check-ups at such a young age\nstudent: Elena's told us last week that she felt uncomfortable\nteacher: I see! And is everything ok?\nstudent: The doctor told us that it could be the result of her disease one month ago\nteacher: Yes, I remember that one\nteacher: could be' - good modal of deduction)\nteacher: And how is Ethan? Is his sense of taste / smell back?\nstudent: It looks like there is a small irritation (?)\nteacher: Yes, there is a small irritation\nteacher: Irritation can be both a physical symptom and an emotion))\nstudent: \u041e\u043a, \u0441\u0435\u0439\u0447\u0430\u0441 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c \u043d\u0435 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u044e \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043f\u043e-\u0430\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438. \u041e\u043d\u0438 \u0432\u0437\u044f\u043b\u0438 \u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437 \u043c\u0430\u0437\u043e\u043a \u0438 \u0431\u0430\u043a \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0435\u0432 )\nstudent: And in several days we will see if there is a problem and what we have to do\nteacher: they took some samples!\nstudent: Ah! Ok! They took some samples )\nteacher: In gynecology, it's called a smear test\nteacher: All women in the UK have to have a smear test to detect signs of cancer every 3 years\nstudent: Ok! I see now!\nteacher: Well, they are not made to, but they are offered a test and encouraged to have it\nteacher: but it can also be done for the bacterial flora etc.\nstudent: I see\nteacher: How did she take it? Was she upset?\nstudent: Yes, now we've done the smear test to check the bacterial flora\nstudent: Everything was ok\nteacher: That's good news!\nstudent: She was a bit afraid but not a lot\nstudent: But she was really upset, not because of the doctor\nteacher: Why was she upset?\nstudent: she knows that in the hospital they have lots of toys and she wanted to play\nstudent: But now they don't have the toys because of covid restrictions\nstudent: So she was very upset )\nteacher: Oh I see! Yes, disappointing for her!\nteacher: UK schools had to remove all soft toys\nteacher: and if there are dolls, they can't have any doll clothes and stuff like that\nstudent: I know that we have the same restrictions in kindergartens\nteacher: Oh yes, I see\nteacher: Have you heard anything about a coronavirus vaccine in Ukraine? Is the government going to buy it?\nstudent: But it's strange. I've heard that coronavirus doesn't live on textile as long as on other materials\nstudent: I mean plastic or metal\nstudent: Yes, I have.\nteacher: I suppose textiles are just harder to wash\nteacher: Here teachers disinfect all surfaces at the end of the day\nstudent: I've read something like Zelensky had an agreement with the USA\nteacher: That's good news!\nstudent: For some number of doses of the vaccine\nstudent: First they will use it for vulnerable people\nteacher: !\nteacher: good vocabulary)\nstudent: ))\nstudent: Thank you\nstudent: I have it from you )\nstudent: Actually\nteacher: :)\nstudent: I have a question about the last chat )\nteacher: The UK hopes to start vaccinating people very soon. First the people who are over 90 years old, then 80 and so on\nstudent: I've read it one more time before the lesson\nteacher: Yes, please!\nstudent: I've got to start buying\nstudent: What is the tense?\nteacher: This is a very good question!\nteacher: I have got to start buying. Have + V3. As you can see, grammatically it's present perfect\nstudent: yes\nstudent: I see\nstudent: But get to start\nstudent: is it a special expression?\nteacher: But! 'have got to do something' is an expression that means 'should'\nstudent: Ah, ok!\nteacher: Yes, it's a present perfect form but it's really used in the present, just as an expression\nstudent: Maybe I've got to know it ))\nteacher: Yes, it's just something you've got to learn))\nteacher: Same with 'I've got two guinea pigs'\nteacher: the form of present perfect, but it just means 'I have'\nteacher: I've got two guinea pigs. I haven't got any pets. Have you got any pets?\nteacher: I have two guinea pigs. I don't have any pets. Do you have any pets?\nteacher: They mean the same thing\nstudent: I don't.\nstudent: ))\nstudent: Ok!\nstudent: So\nteacher: And I do!\nstudent: If I'm answering the question Have you got any pets?,  I answer I haven't?\nteacher: I think grammatically 'I have...' makes more sense, but people use 'have got' very very often\nteacher: Yes, correct!\nstudent: If I'm answering Do you have any pets?,  I answer I don't?\nteacher: That's right!\nstudent: Ok! THank you!\nteacher: no problem. Good question, like I said\nstudent: I've got lots of them usually ))))\nteacher: Ok, shall we go back to our letters to the imaginary client?\nstudent: yes!\nteacher: That's a good thing!\nteacher: Ok! I think we mostly finished the first one, just one small thing left there\nteacher: in spite of something = despite something\nteacher: In spite of the lockdown, we're having fun. Despite the lockdown, we're having fun\nstudent: Ok!\nteacher: Despite of it we assure we will help you also with the grammar, reading etc.\nteacher: This was your sentence\nteacher: so it would be just 'Despite this fact, we assure you...'\nteacher: despite the fact that... is another popular expression\nstudent: ok! Thank you!\nteacher: Despite the fact that English people traditionally drink tea, a lot of them drink coffee nowadays\nstudent: I thought beer ))\nteacher: ))))) beer remains popular too!\nstudent: )\nteacher: Ok! The next one!\nteacher: I am just checking in to see if you had have a chance to read my email from November 25 2020.\nteacher: Can you spot the two words that you need to move around?\nstudent: have had\nteacher: Yes, that's right :)\nstudent: )\nteacher: The next one, about payments, is really well-written!\nteacher: One tiny thing is the verb 'send'\nteacher: the forms are 'send-sent-sent'\nteacher: And I would change some bits of this sentence around\nteacher: Also please let me know which date and the time we can schedule for the one hour trial lesson with you.\nstudent: ok!\nteacher: ... which date and time we can schedule the one-hour trial lesson for\nstudent: one-hour\nteacher: Yes!\nteacher: We can schedule it for Thursday 12 pm\nteacher: let me know what time we can schedule the lesson for\nstudent: ok!\nteacher: The preposition jumps to the end\nstudent: I see\nteacher: But a very good email overall!\nteacher: Finally, we've got the one about a problem sending payment, right?\nteacher: Dear Ms. Patel, Thank you for bringing it up to us. We will check the payment system and will return to you as soon as possible. Best regards, Sarah Smith from \"Campus Creations\"\nstudent: Yes!\nteacher: I would just go with 'Thank you for bringing it up.' or 'Thank your for bringing it up with us'\nstudent: Ok!\nteacher: and I would use 'get back to you' instead of 'return' to you\nteacher: But otherwise perfect!\nstudent: Ok! Thanks!\nteacher: Ok, very well done with all those letters!\nteacher: Do you have a cancellation policy at school?\nstudent: Yes, we do\nstudent: You have to write us before 7 pm the day before your lesson if you would like to cancel or postpone it\nstudent: If you don't do this, you have to pay even if you can't do the lesson\nteacher: I see! Very reasonable, yes\nteacher: I thought, if a client contacts you about that, some expressions that might be useful are\nstudent: \u0406\u0433\u043a\u0443!\nstudent: Sure!\nteacher: We are sorry to hear you missed your class / you were experiencing problems with your Internet connection\nteacher: As stated in our terms and conditions,\nteacher: this phrase is a good start, and then you tell them what the rule is))\nstudent: ok\nteacher: Like, remember you signed the terms and conditions?)))\nteacher: For example,\nstudent: And the tense\nstudent: you missed your class\nstudent: So it's about the past\nstudent: but when he/she writes us before\nstudent: e\nteacher: As stated in our terms and conditions, refunds are not issued for cancellations that took place after 7 pm the day before the class\nteacher: Ok, yes\nstudent: We are sorry to hear you will miss your class?\nteacher: Hi Sarah Smith, I'm very sorry, I need to cancel tomorrow's class because I'm going on a business trip. What's the best way to do it?\nteacher: Yes, good one!\nstudent: I'm very sorry to hear you can't do your class tomorrow. As stated in our terms and conditions, refunds are not issued for cancellations that took place after 7 pm the day before the class\nstudent: And then should I add anything?\nstudent: Like you will be charged for the lesson?\nteacher: Please make sure you inform us about a cancellation in advance next time to avoid this problem in the future\nteacher: Well, I think it's clear you're not giving them their money back.\nteacher: Also, teachers give classes and students have classes. or attend classes\nstudent: Ok so nothing about the charge? )\nteacher: attend is a more formal word, so probably good for a formal letter\nteacher: What would you like to add?\nstudent: Ok\nstudent: I mean you will be charged for the lesson\nteacher: Yes, or something like, 'You cancelled at 8 pm, which means you will be charged for the lesson\nstudent: Ok! I see\nstudent: Maybe I can write a letter as my home work?\nteacher: And if they cancelled on time, 'Your refund will be issued within 5 working days' or something like that\nteacher: Good idea! Yes :)\nstudent: Ok\nstudent: we don't refund\nstudent: We just postpone the sum until the next lesson\nstudent: if you cancel before 7 pm\nteacher: Oh yes, makes sense!\nteacher: there's an expression for that, but I can't think of it at the moment\nstudent: can I use the verb postpone?\nteacher: It'll be my homework!\nstudent: Ah! Ok )\nstudent: Right )\nstudent: Now it's fair )\nteacher: Definitely :))\nstudent: I have my homework and you have yours )\nteacher: Ok, I'll let you go! Enjoy your afternoon!\nstudent: it's a joke ))\nteacher: I know))\nstudent: Thank you!\nstudent: You too\nstudent: Bye!!\nteacher: My pleasure, bye!",

Do you go to work or work from home?\nstudent: I go to work at my office.\nteacher: I see! Did you have to work from home when the pandemic was bad in China?\nstudent: Yes. I worked from home from Jan to April this year.\nteacher: I see! Do you prefer working from home or at the office?\nstudent: I think working at the office is better.\nteacher: Why do you think so/\nteacher: ?\nstudent: Working at the office can let you have a feeling of working atmosphere.\nteacher: Yes, it can be easier to focus\nteacher: Are there any benefit to working from home in your opinion?\nstudent: It's more efficient, and it's more convenient to communicate with your partner\nteacher: Do you mean in the office?\nstudent: Working from home also has some positive points.\nteacher: Ok, for example?\nstudent: Like we can save time on travelling to the office. In big cities such as Beijing, we always waste a lot of time to travel between our home and the office.\nteacher: Yes, very good point! The word for it is 'to commute'\nteacher: to commute = to travel to work / school\nteacher: a commute is a journey to work /school\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: and a commuter is a person who commutes\nteacher: How long does your commute take?\nstudent: I live near my office, I spend an hour commuting every day.\nteacher: An hour! That's still a lot!\nteacher: I spend an hour ON commuting\nteacher: we spend time / money / energy on something\nstudent: ON\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: My husband used to commute to Cambridge, it took him about an hour. But he hasn't been at work since March! He's been working from home this whole time because of covid restrictions\nteacher: And I always work from home. I used to occasionally go to Cambridge for meetings but I haven't since the lockdown\nstudent: When you work from home I think you may need to have meetings online.\nteacher: Yes, people use things like Microsoft Teams for that\nteacher: Thank you for sending me your homework. Your essay is really good!!\nstudent: Thanks.\nteacher: The grammar is really good. How long did it take you to write it?\nstudent: Since I graduated from college, I have forgotten a lot of English.\nstudent: You taught me a lot during the last lesson, so it didn't take me too much time. It was less than 30 minutes.\nteacher: I see, because we worked on some sentences last time, makes sense. Still, the result to be proud of!\nteacher: Are you looking forward to your weekend?\nstudent: Yes. I have something to learn for my PHD exams.\nstudent: Weekends are the best time for me to study.\nteacher: Ok, could you tell me a few things about this weekend using the future forms we've been talking about?\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: I see! Weekends are the best time for you to study\nstudent: I'm having a lesson on machine learning online this Saturday.\nteacher: Ok, and if you're talking about a plan...\nstudent: And then I'm going to the National Library at 10 a.m on Sunday.\nteacher: Ok, both these sentences sound like your plans to me. Could you try and use Present Continous (be + Ving) or 'be going to' in them?\nstudent: I'm going to study English at 10 a.m on Sunday at the National Library.\nteacher: Ok, yes! Good grammar!\nteacher: Is there an English class at the National Library?\nstudent: Not exactly. The National Library is the place where I study with my friends.\nstudent: friends\nteacher: Oh, what a lovely idea! Do you get together to speak English?\nstudent: Yes. We always spend some time on practising spoken English.\nteacher: Sounds wonderful!\nteacher: Is there going to be a good game on this weekend?\nteacher: I mean football\nstudent: And recently I've found a grammar book there, it is good for me to study English.\nteacher: Yes, lovely\nteacher: Oh, before we move on.\nstudent: No, this weekend there is no Liverpool FC match.\nteacher: Remember we said last time that we always use 'ON' with an expression that has 'day' in it\nstudent: I mean in Chinese timezone.\nteacher: Do you only watch Liverpool FC games?\nteacher: on Christmas Day; on Sunday; on Monday morning; on weekdays; on my birthday\nstudent: Most of the time I just watch LFC's games.\nstudent: Yes, ON\nteacher: But with days of the week, we can also do without 'on'. This Saturday, I'm going to watch a movie\nteacher: Yes, ON, or 'this / last' without ON\nteacher: My parcel arrived last Monday\nteacher: or My parcel arrived on Monday\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: Ok, sure\nstudent: So 'on this Monday' is wrong.\nteacher: Yes, I remember now that LFC are your team!\nteacher: Yes, that's right!\nteacher: just 'this Monday' or 'on Monday'\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: For example, with 'on your birthday': What do you usually do on your birthday?\nstudent: In the last few years, I often go to my parents' place to eat noodles on my birthday.\nteacher: Sounds lovely)) 'in the recent years'\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: By birthday is at the beginning of spring, and I love to go on a city break on my birthday\nteacher: *sorry, 'my birthday'\nteacher: Ok, let's do a couple of questions from B2 speaking, shall we?\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: Do you prefer to spend time on your own or with other people?\nstudent: Well, I prefer to spend time on my own mostly.\nteacher: Ok, why?\nstudent: I like to stay alone, because I can read books or do something in silence.\nteacher: Ok, cool. I like to stay alone / I like staying alone\nteacher: Ok, next question!\nteacher: Tell us about a film that you like\nstudent: Nowadays there is too much noise around us, finding a place where we can think by ourselves is difficult.\nstudent: A Beautiful Mind\nteacher: Ok, thanks. 'think by ourselves'\nteacher: Beautiful Mind! Excellent choice!\nteacher: You know what I'm going to say :)\nteacher: Why?\nstudent: It tells us a story about John Nash, a famous mathematician. During this movie we can learn that  family's help is the greatest power that can help us overcome difficuties.\nteacher: Ok! Overcome difficulties is a very good expression\nstudent: Sorry, John Nash.\nteacher: the word for a mathematic scientist is a mathematician\nteacher: with the stress on 'ti'\nteacher: a mathemaTIcian\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: OK, great work today, thank you!\nteacher: Hope you enjoy your weekend! I'll speak to you on Monday\nstudent: Thanks.\nstudent: Ok.\nteacher: Bye Ella!\nstudent: Bye",
    "student: Hi Ms. Patel!\nstudent: How are you?\nteacher: Hi Emily Smith!\nstudent: There are some troubles with typing my name )))\nteacher: Ha, it takes me a few attempts to type my username here sometimes!\nstudent: yes\nteacher: And then I think, oops, my students will think I can't even spell my own name!\nteacher: How are you today?\nstudent: But have you noticed that when you type a letter it disappears?\nstudent: *but\nteacher: I know, it's weird! I don't know why\nstudent: I thought the same. I mean what my teacher will think )\nstudent: But then I noticed it\nstudent: Ok! So you know that it's not my problems with spelling )))\nstudent: I'm ok\nteacher: So, you don't know what I'm thinking. And you think: I wonder what my teacher ___ think (a modal verb)\nstudent: Have had a yoga lesson today\nstudent: But actually I wish I had slept instead )\nteacher: Sometimes a nap is better than yoga!\nstudent: my teacher could do?\nteacher: Yes! what my teacher could / might/ may think\nteacher: or 'what my teacher could / might / may be thinking\nteacher: be Ving = continuous infinitive\nstudent: sure!\nteacher: to do = simple infinitive\nstudent: ok!\nteacher: I wonder whether you might be having a cup of macha latte as you're chatting with me here\nteacher: continuous infinitive))\nstudent: I've had a cup of coffee\nstudent: And I'm thinking about one more ))))\nteacher: It's actually spelled 'matcha' I think\nstudent: I think so )\nteacher: Did you not get a good night's sleep?\nstudent: Actually now I have to take some pills\nstudent: I think it's because of them I don't feel 100%\nteacher: Oh sorry to hear that!!\nstudent: feel\nstudent: I think it will be better when I finish them\nstudent: them or it? )\nteacher: Yes, I hope you'll feel better when you finish them!\nstudent: them or it?\nstudent: ok! )\nstudent: Thank you! )\nteacher: How's Mark feeling? Is he back to normal with his sense of smell and taste?\nstudent: yes!\nstudent: I think he was ok in about two or three weeks after the covid had started\nstudent: thank you\nteacher: Very good use of Past Perfect there!\nteacher: And very good news!\nstudent: thanks ))\nteacher: So I told you on Facebook that we had a lovely snowy morning! Can you guess what's going on at the moment? Using can't / must / might / may / could :)\nstudent: It could be melting now? )\nteacher: Good guess! Keep going)\nstudent: haha\nteacher: We need to use those modals!\nstudent: It's my favourite\nstudent: sure!\nteacher: Any other ideas?\nstudent: Ah\nstudent: ok\nteacher: Sorry, I miscommunicated there!\nstudent: There could be muddy puddles? )\nteacher: Ah, spot-on! It's all ugly slush and muddy puddles!\nstudent: And it could be that Peppa Pig will visit you? ))\nteacher: But there's more! Snow has turned into freezing rain! Yuck\nteacher: Even Peppa wouldn't enjoy this! Too cold\nstudent: oh, no!\nteacher: Ah well, at least we enjoyed it in the morning!\nstudent: How cold is it now there?\nteacher: About +1, so I was actually hoping the snow would set\nteacher: But alas!)))\nstudent: haha\nstudent: I like the word )\nstudent: you know )\nteacher: It's very useful))))\nstudent: every time this year ))\nstudent: every time\nteacher: Definitely a good word for 2020!\nteacher: every time is two words))\nstudent: agree ))\nstudent: Ah! Really? ) Ok! Every time )\nteacher: Ok, time for another modal verb (that I'm sure you know very well). Should\nstudent: yes\nteacher: We don't actually use 'should' as a modal of deduction\nstudent: Do you remember the professor from York\nteacher: I do!\nstudent: He asked me all the time, 'Should I do something blablabla'\nstudent: miss ))\nteacher: Yes, correct! 'do you think it's a good idea for me to do something?'\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Should is good for giving advice\nteacher: It's cold. You should wear a hat\nstudent: ok!\nteacher: It's summer. You should put some suncream on\nteacher: etc. etc.)))\nteacher: Let's practise this!\nteacher: I'm going to complain to you, and you give me some advice\nteacher: Because when people complain, they just love hearing advice))\nstudent: It's summer. You should take off your hat )))\nteacher: Yes, take the hat off at last!)))\nstudent: haha\nstudent: ok! Please, complain ))\nteacher: Ok! I'm broke!\nstudent: You should complain )))\nteacher: I have! But I'm still broke!\nstudent: You should find some work and stop with casino )\nteacher: Haha, excellent!\nteacher: You should find some work / you should find a job\nstudent: Ah, ok\nstudent: Is work like something abstract?\nstudent: uncountable I mean\nteacher: Yes, it's uncountable\nstudent: clear!\nteacher: We're under lockdown. I'm bored!\nstudent: You should start to bake ) Usually people do so when they are bored under lockdown )\nteacher: True! very good))\nteacher: Ok, that's easy grammar, not a problem for you at all, is it?\nstudent: yes!\nteacher: Good! Let's practise more with annoying clients))\nteacher: Just to revise the payment vocabulary, I'll ask you money / refund questions, ok?\nstudent: Should we practise more? ))\nteacher: That's it, the York professor gave you a very good model))\nstudent: hahaha\nteacher: Hello, Unfortunately, I missed a class yesterday. Can I have my money back? I know I didn't warn you in advance, sorry about that!\nstudent: Hi Ms. Patel!\nstudent: I'm sorry to hear you missed you class yesterday\nstudent: As stated in our terms and conditions, a student has to inform us before 7 pm the day before the lesson if he or she has to cancel it\nstudent: We are very sorry, but you didn't do so\nstudent: Unfortunately we can't send the money back\nteacher: Ok, lovely! Well done!\nstudent: Actually\nteacher: As stated in our terms and conditions, a student ___ to inform ...\nstudent: lly\nstudent: Regards or Best wishes\nstudent: What is the best option then?\nteacher: they are pretty much the same!\nstudent: As stated in our terms and conditions, a student has to inform ...\nteacher: Yes, well done!\nstudent: ok! Thank you!\nteacher: By the way, to avoid using 'he or she', you can just use 'they'\nteacher: even for a singular noun\nteacher: a student hast to inform us... if they have to cancel\nstudent: Ah! Ok!\nteacher: It might be a bit unusual for you\nstudent: didn't know it\nteacher: I'll give you an example\nteacher: a definition of the word 'someone' from the dictionary\nteacher: used to refer to a single person when you do not know who they are or when it is not important who they are\nteacher: a definition of 'patriot', for example\nteacher: a person who loves their country and, if necessary, will fight for it\nteacher: THEIR country\nteacher: as you can see\nteacher: it's a nice easy way to include everyone\nstudent: yes\nstudent: but their is too strange\nstudent: Oh\nteacher: I know! It takes some getting used to\nstudent: Should I ask you a question? ))\nteacher: Go on :)\nstudent: Ok\nstudent: sometimes when it's a statement in English, there is something like do + verb\nteacher: could you give me an example?\nstudent: It's not a question, but it's still do + verb\nstudent: hm\nteacher: oooh, I think I know\nteacher: I do love chocolate!\nteacher: like this?\nstudent: yes!!\nstudent: to emphasise the information?\nteacher: one sec, I've got a delivery\nstudent: ok!\nteacher: I'm so sorry!!\nteacher: It was a parcel for my neighbour\nteacher: I shouldn't have opened the door!\nteacher: This is the grammar I was planning to do with you next time: I shouldn't + have + V3\nteacher: for things that we regret))\nstudent: )\nteacher: Anyway, you're absolutely right, this is to emphasise the information\nteacher: I do love TV shows, but this one is a bit silly\nstudent: Ok! I see now\nteacher: I did believe in Santa when I was small\nstudent: thank you!\nteacher: a less emotional way to say this would just be 'I believed in Santa when I was small'\nstudent: yes! Sure!\nstudent: Actually it's interesting\nteacher: I was thinking about a way to express that you don't give refund and instead use the money to pay for the next class\nteacher: I think a good way would be 'the payment will be used as credit towards the next class'\nstudent: you know that here the post doesn't leave parcels with neighbors\nstudent: ok! It's a good phrase!\nstudent: phrase )\nteacher: Yes, and you have to go to the post office to get your parcel, right?\nteacher: phrase\nstudent: Sometimes you have to go, sometimes they have a courier. I really can't understand the rules ))\nstudent: Yes! Phrase!!!! Oh! )\nteacher: If you get on with your neighbours, you can take parcels for each other. It's annoying though when you have to answer the door all the time and take parcels for your neighbours! But then, they take parcels for us, too\nstudent: get on?\nteacher: And we do have really nice neighbours, so I don't want to say no\nteacher: yes, if you get one with someone, you have a good relationship with them\nstudent: I thought so )\nstudent: thank you\nteacher: like, my brother and I don't really get on\nteacher: things like that\nteacher: *sorry, get on, not get one!\nstudent: do you have a brother??\nteacher: Noo, that's why I wrote brother, just as an example))\nstudent: it's a joke ))\nstudent: have you got a brother is better )\nteacher: I don't always get on with my sister!)) but we still love each other\nstudent: I see )\nteacher: Have you got... and Do you have... are both correct!\nteacher: Do you get on with your brother?\nstudent: Yes, we are not very close, but we get on 100% )\nteacher: Wonderful!\nteacher: Ok, I've got to let you go. Have a relaxing weekend!\nstudent: You too! Thank you!\nstudent: bye!\nteacher: My pleasure :)\nteacher: bye!",
    "student: Hi\nstudent: Sorry, today I am late again\nstudent: But here there is a festival and so the routine was a bit different from usual\nteacher: Hi Sara! No problem!\nteacher: What festivity is it?\nstudent: The immaculate conception of the Virgin Mary... we also have it in Italy.\nteacher: Oh I see! I haven\nteacher: sorry, I haven't been following religious holidays closely here\nteacher: Is it a big celebration?\nstudent: Don't worry...I don't think they have it in the UK, it was introduced by the catholic church in the last century, I guess\nstudent: No, not really...but everything is closed so we took the opportunity to go to the city for a walk,\nteacher: I see, it's a public holiday! It's not here\nstudent: and we finished lunch a bit later than on other days.\nteacher: Actually, 'festivities' is plural, now that I think about it\nteacher: Fair enough, no problem\nteacher: How much time have you got for the class?\nstudent: Also one hour, if you can...but I am so sorry for being late again...\nteacher: For the singular, you would use a holiday / a festival\nteacher: My next class is not until 1.30, so no worries, we can do an hour\nstudent: I am sorry, but unfortunately last Tuesday and this one had some changes from the standard routine...\nstudent: Thank you :)\nteacher: It just means I will do less of the boring annotating and more of the fun data generating :)\nstudent: What about you, how were the last two weeks? Is the corona situation improving`\nstudent: ?\nstudent: Haha, I see...because you also have to annotate the text? Wow, that must be a bit boring...\nteacher: I'm joking, it's not boring. But it's definitely not as fun as teaching!\nteacher: It does give me an opportunity for self-reflection as a teacher\nteacher: Yes, I anonymise everything, mark sequences and label them\nstudent: Well...I guess it is great that you can see the positive side of it...I know of some people who had to annotate images for image recognition problems and they felt like it was the most boring job in the word.\nteacher: Well, I'm annotating quite interesting material, so it's kind of both challenging and a bit monotonous\nteacher: How would you describe the work that takes a lot of time and requires a lot of attention to detail?\nteacher: just looking for adjectives here, mainly\nstudent: In Italian I would use the word 'certosino', and I would guess English has a similar version...but I can't recall the exact word\nteacher: Hmm, no, I don't think English borrowed that one :)\nteacher: there's 'meticulous'\nteacher: ver careful and with great attention to detail\nstudent: I just checked and you are right, 'certosino' is in Italian only...but ok, meticulous\nteacher: it can describe a person or a job\nstudent: which sounds just like the Italian 'meticoloso'\nteacher: a meticulous researcher / meticulous research\nteacher: Ok, I didn't realize it was of Latin origin! There we go then\nteacher: Then stress is on 'ti'\nteacher: meTIculous\nteacher: There's also 'painstaking'\nstudent: Okay! Your description of the word was meticulous\nteacher: Haha, yes))\nteacher: painstaking = extremely careful and correct, and involving a lot of effor\nteacher: effort\nteacher: according to Cambridge English Dictionary\nstudent: Does painstaking have a meaning which is more connected to the idea of the fatigue associated with the job?\nteacher: hmm, I wouldn't say so!\nteacher: again, painstaking research\nteacher: a painstaking journalist will look into every possible detail before expressing an opinion\nteacher: The one that expresses the idea of fatigue is 'tedious'\nstudent: I see..then I believe I have always interpreted this word in a slightly wrong way...good to know it is a synonym of meticulous\nteacher: yes, painstaking research is actually a compliment to the quality of the research\nteacher: whereas 'tedious' just makes you tired\nteacher: a tedious lecture\nstudent: Does tedious involve only the idea of 'tiredness' or also the one of 'boredom'?\nteacher: a tedious job of annotating images\nteacher: Boredom too, you're right!\nteacher: Probably boredom first and fatigue second, actually\nteacher: So my work is not tedious, but it's definitely painstaking!\nstudent: I see! I guess nobody wants to do a tedious job...\nteacher: No, definitely!\nteacher: What's your work like?\nstudent: I would say it is difficult to describe it: sometimes it is tedious because, to state it in simple terms, there are some problems with the configurations of the computers I use. But most of the times it is very interesting: you never know where you will end up...and you need to be meticolous about everything you do.\nteacher: I see! Those configuration problems do sound very frustrating\nstudent: I really love the part of discovering what the best way to make a machine 'learn' is...now that I think about it, it also reminds me a bit of detective work: many parts of what the machine does are opaque to humans, and so we must get the best out of what we can understand about the system.\nteacher: Back to your question about the corona situation, I hope it's improving! We're now under a 'tier' system, it's pretty strict in most parts of the country. But then, the government is lifting most of restrictions for 5 days around Christmas, something scientists are calling madness\nstudent: They are boring because they often require hours of work to achieve little...I would compare it to a professor, who has to clean his classroom and fix the lightbulbs which often burn out.\nstudent: I see :) Here the situation is getting better...but for the first time I won't meet my family because both Austria and Italy will maintain restrictions during the holidays, especially on people travelling from other countries.\nteacher: I see! Is it slightly paradoxical that humans cannot understand their own creations (machines)? That's what it sounded like to me\nteacher: Yes, we have also decided not to travel to celebrate with my in-laws, something we always used to do. Hopefully just for one Christmas!\nstudent: It is slightly paradoxical..but modern artificial intelligence is extremely complex, so we have only a 'general' idea about what is going on. In fact this is called the 'black box problem': we can't really see inside it...\nteacher: Yes, my husband told me about it (something he'd learned about as part of his master's in digital education)\nteacher: about the idea of a black box I mean\nstudent: I hope too it is only for one Christmas...and I really hope we can celebrate at Easter, with a nice BBQ.\nteacher: I am very curious about a machine that will learn from these chats and will presumably be able to teach English as a foreign language eventually\nteacher: Oh yes, that would be nice! In fact, the first vaccines are being given in the UK today\nstudent: Haha...I think that will take a while.\nstudent: (for a machine to substitute you...even though doing text-only would be easier).\nteacher: Good, my colleagues and I won't be out of jobs just yet!\nteacher: On a more festive note, I'm making a stollen this week, so that it has time to ripen by Christmas. Is it a thing in Austria?\nstudent: Yes, I have read about it...and also how some people from the US weren't 'delighted' that the UK did it first, and under European laws.\nstudent: Hmm...no, and I will tell you that I don't know what a stollen is.\nstudent: I just checked: is it the traditional German bread?\nstudent: To be honest I don't know...this is our first Christmas in Austria and, for obvious reasons, I didn't have the opportunity to see and talk with many locals lately...\nteacher: Oh yes, the politics around the vaccine is unbelievable. Our health secretary has come up with some regrettable comments, about how the UK got hold of the vaccine before the EU thanks to Brexit. Disgusting!\nteacher: Yes, it should be marvellous! I'm making my own candied peel, then soaking it in some rum, then baking into a bread that should ripen for a couple of weeks\nstudent: Sounds great! I will also try it, then! But I guess this year it is a bit complicated: tomorrow my wife starts her new job, so I don't know how much free time I shall have.\nteacher: Oh exciting! Congratulations to your wife\nteacher: Which one is it? The one at a private clinic?\nstudent: Thank you! It is a private clinic, in this way she starts with few hours per week and no shifts.\nteacher: But I can imagine two careers and two very young children is a whole new level of challenge!\nteacher: Oh good, sounds lovely!\nteacher: Do you bake?\nstudent: Indeed...that is why she is starting slow ;) She used to work in a hospital and we could make it only because I was doing my PhD, so I didn't have 'working time'. Which meant I ended up working nights and weekends, but at least we could do it.\nstudent: I do, I love cooking :) I would say people from Italy cook and bake a lot more than Austrians, at least on average...\nteacher: Yes, it's a tricky one!\nteacher: Oh wonderful! My husband's really into cooking, and I bake and ferment (and grow fresh fruit and vegetables)\nteacher: I know what you mean though, we cook everything from scratch, and we do stand out\nteacher: as in, most our friends don't\nstudent: Indeed...we see it also from what we throw away (here in Austria recycling is really important, if you don't want to pay fines)\nstudent: We are those who throw away most compostable stuff, because of all the vegetables we peel, cut and cook\nteacher: That's good! Here in the UK it's recommended rather than obligatory, unfortunately!\nstudent: I remember you telling me about your vegetable garden...and a new small greenhouse you had bought, but I can't remember the exact term.\nteacher: a polytunnel\nteacher: can't wait to install it!\nstudent: Will it be next spring?\nteacher: Yes, we compost loads in the garden. And we have a pair of guinea pigs that turn vegetable scraps into lovely manure\nteacher: Yes, next spring!\nteacher: Sorry, I get carried away talking about compost an manure because they're so lovely for my veg patch but I appreciate that not everyone is as into it as I am. Hope I haven't offended your sensibilities!\nstudent: Haha...manure...that is a term I learned this or last year, I can't remember from which book though...\nstudent: Haha, no, I don't have any 'sensibility' argument don't worry\nteacher: Good! :)\nstudent: And I would love to have a composting place and a small garden one day...but currently we don't have the space (and with small kids, that's enough work for now)+\nteacher: Oh, have you got that email in which I sent you a pdf of a textbook?\nstudent: Yes, I have it!\nteacher: One day, hopefully! I don't know how common houses with gardens are in Austria and Italy\nteacher: Could you open the book please? to page 102 (page 103 in the pdf)\nteacher: The one that says section 1 'time and reason\nstudent: They are relatively common in the country side, but currently we are in a flat. We have a garden, but I can't work it with a shovel as I would my own...\nstudent: Yes, one second!\nstudent: Okay, so time clauses and reason clauses\nstudent: Should I read it all?\nteacher: Yes, lovely! Could you read through the time clauses on the left and make a list (here) of the expressions that you would say are low frequency (good for a book or for a well-written article, but not for a chat with a friend)\nteacher: Just the first section\nteacher: until the -ing clauses\nstudent: Okay, I have read it,.\nteacher: Ok, have you spotted any time expressions that are new to you?\nstudent: None is completely new, but there are a few I probably don't use\nstudent: Whilst, for example\nstudent: no sooner...than\nstudent: by which time...\nteacher: Yes, good ones\nteacher: whilst and no sooner... than are not exactly colloquial\nteacher: but they can be great in writing\nteacher: The reason I brought this material up is a structure like 'On phoning the reception, she was informed that...'\nstudent: Indeed...I am sure I have encountered them in reading\nteacher: it's the same reduced adverbial\nstudent: What is a reduced adverbial?\nteacher: When she phoned the reception, she was informed ' can be reduced to 'On phoning..., she..\nstudent: By the way, now that I read it I am pretty sure that I would hardly ever use such a structure even though I perfectly understand it.\nstudent: I see.\nteacher: But, if the subjects of the clauses were different, we wouldn't be able to do it\nstudent: Which means no parallel structures\nteacher: When she phoned the reception, they informed her that...\nteacher: we can't do the same thing here\nstudent: I see\nteacher: because the subjects are different\nteacher: This is not actually a parallel structure, but it is something we talked about in terms of your writing\nstudent: On travelling home, she received a call.\nteacher: Yes! this one is good\nstudent: While travelling home, they called her. -&gt; this can't be transformed\nteacher: Well, actually, in this last sentence it looks like 'they' were travelling home :)\nteacher: While she was travelling home, they called her\nteacher: we can't reduce this one\nstudent: You are right...in English this wouldn't be that clear...\nteacher: Yes!\nteacher: Also, note the use of tenses in 'Immediately he'd finished, the repairman left'\nteacher: She'd no sooner switched on the TV than there was an explosion\nteacher: Past Perfect to signal an action that happened first, Past Simple for the one that followed\nstudent: Now that you make me notice it: 'Immediately he'd finished, the repairman left' is a structure that it is indeed 'new' to me.\nstudent: That is past perfect + past simple...okay...Yes, I mean, I have read a lot in English so I knew already what these sentences meant\nstudent: But I wouldn't be able to produce them.\nteacher: It's an excellent book to get into this really advanced stuff\nstudent: I see...\nteacher: And yes, your observation is spot-on, we can understand way more complex language than we can produce\nteacher: in a foreign language, but also if we are not professional writers / speakers\nstudent: Indeed...then, should I do some exercises, or produce some examples with this structure for the next time?\nteacher: Ok, I've got to let you go to let the chatroom reset. We can look into these things some more next week. Let me know if you decide / have time to have a go at a stollen, we can compare notes))\nteacher: Oh, if you have the time, the first two exercises on the next page would be great\nstudent: Okay, then I will do those for the next time. Same hour? Next week everything should be regular!\nteacher: Yes, sure! Same time next week!\nstudent: Haha, I'll let you know, of course!\nstudent: Great, have a nice day! And thank you for the lesson...and sorry for being late ;)\nteacher: No problem, my pleasure, have a lovely week!\nstudent: You too!",
    "student: hi\nteacher: Hi Emily!\nteacher: Your username looks mysterious today!\nstudent: yes\nstudent: if you turn your head\nstudent: upside down\nstudent: you will be able to read my nickname\nteacher: Hmmm, I've turned my laptop upside down, but it hasn't helped\nteacher: Oh, got it! It says\nteacher: I love you!\nstudent: yes\nteacher: That's clever))\nstudent: hehe\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: fine\nstudent: and you ?\nteacher: All good, thank you!\nteacher: It was snowing last Friday! It was wonderful and unexpected\nstudent: nice\nstudent: congratulations\nteacher: Thank you!\nteacher: What's the weather like in Kyiv?\nstudent: a bit of snow today\nstudent: and very cold\nteacher: ok, can you make a full sentence, please?\nstudent: it was a bit snowy and really cold today\nteacher: Ok, that's better, thank you :)\nteacher: If it's 'today' though, it's not Past Simple, is it? Could you try Present Perfect instead?\nstudent: but it is not snowing anymore\nteacher: I see, yes. But it's still today. Even if the action finished, the time hasn't\nteacher: You can say 'It was snowing this morning' because it's not morning anymore\nteacher: but 'It __ ___ snowing today'\nteacher: because today is still on\nstudent: It was snowing in the morning and it has been cold\nteacher: Ok, that's good :)\nteacher: It's ok to say 'It has been snowing today!'\nteacher: One second, I'll find an exercise for this\nteacher: But a lot of the time, we look not at the action, whether it's finished or not, but at the time word\nteacher: to decide which tense to use\nteacher: For example, 'My friend hasn't come to school today'\nteacher: You could argue that the action is in the past. It's already happened. But the time is still today\nteacher: and we're using a present tense\nteacher: Does it make sense to you?\nstudent: I think yes\nteacher: I'll find an exercise for you in a minute, I had it somewhere\nteacher: How did the party go on Friday?\nstudent: it was okay\nstudent: there was some nice food and we played mafia\nteacher: Ooh, mafia, I remember that!\nteacher: Are you planning to have a party for your birthday?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: What would you like your party to be like?\nstudent: I haven't really thought about it\nstudent: I will think about it in January\nteacher: You haven't thought about it?\nteacher: Sure :)\nteacher: See, this is a Present Perfect situation. You're telling me now about it, the result is important now\nteacher: so 'you haven't thought about it'\nteacher: Ok, I'm going to give you a few sentences. Can you look at the time adverbial, please (the phrase that states the time) and let me know if it's a finished past time or a an unfinished time that is still continuing\nteacher: My grandparents moved to the United States IN 1968.\nteacher: finished past or not finished?\nstudent: finished\nteacher: yes, correct! 1968 is long over\nteacher: next one\nteacher: They're still in the US, so they've lived there FOR MORE THAN 50 YEARS.\nstudent: not finished\nteacher: correct!\nteacher: My grandparents came to visit us LAST WEEK\nstudent: finished\nteacher: They've visited us every summer SINCE I WAS BORN.\nstudent: not finished\nteacher: Sorry, Greg hasn't come to work TODAY. Can I take a message?\nstudent: not finished\nteacher: Sorry, Greg went out FIVE MINUTES AGO. Can I take a message?\nstudent: finished\nteacher: I've received 25 emails THIS MORNING, most of them spam!\nstudent: finished\nteacher: uh-uh!\nteacher: this morning sounds unfinished to me)\nstudent: it is finished\nstudent: to me\nteacher: Oh, I see what you mean. Like with the snow example? It's finished to us now because it's the afternoon\nstudent: yes\nteacher: But from this sentence (from the exercise), it sounds like it's still the morning.\nteacher: Actually, look at the next sentence\nteacher: I received 25 emails THIS MORNING, most of them spam!\nteacher: What's the difference between the sentences?\nstudent: perfect and past\nteacher: Yes, the only difference is the tense\nstudent: not finished anf finished\nteacher: Present Perfect + this morning = unfinished\nteacher: past simple + this morning = finished (like the snow)\nteacher: Ok, let's test your memory!\nteacher: Could you insert the verb in the correct form?\nteacher: My grandparents (move)     to the United States in 1968.\nstudent: moved\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: They're still in the US, so they (live)     there for more than 50 years.\nstudent: they have lived\nteacher: yes, good!\nteacher: My grandparents (come)     to visit us last week.\nstudent: came\nteacher: They (visit)     us every summer since I was born.\nstudent: have visited\nteacher: Sorry, Greg (come)     to work today. Can I take a message?\nstudent: hasn't come\nteacher: yes, good!\nteacher: Sorry, Greg (go out)     five minutes ago. Can I take a message?\nstudent: went out\nteacher: yes\nteacher: It's 11 a.m. \u2013 I     25 emails this morning, most of them spam!\nstudent: have received\nteacher: yes, we get some help here with '11 a.m.' :)\nteacher: It's 6 p.m. \u2013 I     25 emails this morning, most of them spam!\nstudent: received\nteacher: Yes, well done!\nteacher: Present Perfect is quite unusual for speaker of Russian / Ukrainian, but it's a very common tense in English\nteacher: I'll tell you about some of the things I have done today.\nteacher: I've taken my son to school, I've baked a bread, I've spoken to my boss, I've taught a class and now I'm talking to you\nteacher: They are all finished actions but they all happened 'today'\nteacher: Now, I could have said, 'I took my son to school at 8.30 am and I spoke to my boss at 11 am'\nteacher: I would put those actions in the past\nteacher: But with 'today' Present Perfect is fine!\nteacher: What have you done today so far?\nstudent: I have been to school\nteacher: Ok, cool. Can you give me two more examples, please?\nstudent: I have eaten my breakfast\nstudent: I have forgotten my trainers for PE\nstudent: forgotten\nteacher: Oh no!\nteacher: good correction :)\nteacher: Good! What have you done this week?\nstudent: I have done my homework\nstudent: done\nteacher: Cool! Have you watched / played / read anything exciting?\nstudent: no\nteacher: Have you learned anything exciting at school? :)\nstudent: no\nteacher: Ok, can you make three sentences about boring unexciting things that have happened this week?\nstudent: Our teacher has said that we are really bad students\nstudent: we have started a new topic in physics\nteacher: Oh no, sounds harsh!\nstudent: and our biology teacher has come back after her 2-week self-isolation\nteacher: Oh did she have to self-isolate for two weeks? Did she have covid?\nstudent: I don't know\nteacher: Our biology teacher __ ___ back\nstudent: has\nteacher: and the second gap?\nstudent: come\nteacher: Yes, well done :)\nteacher: This week, I've started to bake a German Christams cake called 'stollen'\nteacher: Have you heard of this one?\nstudent: no\nteacher: It takes a few days to make it, and then about two weeks for it to ripen\nteacher: So I had to start early\nteacher: It's got lots of raisins and citrus peel in it, as well as nuts\nteacher: I'm excited about it!\nteacher: Did you find it upsetting that your teacher said you were all bad students?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Oh no! Is it a teacher that you like?\nstudent: she shouts a lot\nstudent: no\nteacher: I'm sure it was an exaggeration!\nteacher: do you know 'exaggeration'?\nstudent: no\nteacher: when we say that something is much bigger / worse / better / more important than it actually is\nteacher: for example, it's a cold day in England today, but I could say, 'It's absolutely Arctic'\nteacher: Well, of course it's not! It's probably -30 degrees in the Arctic\nteacher: and it's only +1 here\nteacher: so this is an exaggeration\nteacher: As I'm sure what your teacher said was :)\nstudent: she was angry just because one boy was smiling\nteacher: Haha, well, definitely an exaggeration then, right?\nteacher: Ok, Emily, I'll let you go. Is it another Minecraft night tonight?\nstudent: no\nstudent: only Fridays\nteacher: Oh goodness, can you believe I thought it was Friday?!\nteacher: Uh-uh, back to reality! :))\nstudent: hehe)\nstudent: goodbye !\nteacher: I'll let you go anyway :) bye!",
    "student: Hello Ms. Johnson!\nteacher: Hi Emma Smith!\nteacher: How are you? All ok?\nstudent: I'm fine! Thanks\nstudent: And you?\nteacher: All good, thank you\nstudent: Unfortunately, I haven't done my homework\nteacher: Slightly overwhelmed with all the Christmas prep\nstudent: We can do it in the chatroom\nteacher: Oh, no worries!\nteacher: Yes, sure\nstudent: Do you have a lot of preparation to do?\nteacher: It feels like it! There's presents for family and friends to sort, cards to write etc. Cards are really big in this country!\nstudent: Oh yes. Presents\nteacher: There's a 'post box' at school, and all children exchange cards and send cards to teachers\nstudent: A disaster really\nteacher: There's a lot of peer pressure!\nstudent: with my family of God knows how many members\nstudent: God knows*\nstudent: So Caleb is making one too?\nstudent: Or it's not the only one??\nteacher: Oh yes, you do have a big family, don't you? I suppose it's a blessing and a challenge at the same time?\nstudent: Exactly. During the holiday season it's a nightmare\nstudent: *nightmare\nteacher: A card to each of the three teachers + cards for his school friends\nstudent: OMG\nstudent: Can you just make one and copy it? )))))\nteacher: And I've just remembered, a card for his PE teacher!\nteacher: No, they've got to be handwritten!\nstudent: No way\nteacher: I know. The pressure is real\nstudent: This is intense\nteacher: And you know, it's the peer pressure between parents. Everyone's one-upping each other with presents to teachers. I vowed not to take part, but am crumbling under the pressure\nstudent: This year I told my family, 'That's enough! I don't have enough money to buy you the presents you don't really need. Let's do Secret Santa this time!'\nteacher: Oh, that's a brilliant idea!\nteacher: Everyone's probably feeling this way, but someone has to say it!\nstudent: Why would parents do that? Aren't they busy with more important stuff?\nstudent: Thank you! I think so too\nteacher: That's my question as well. How do they have the time and energy for this, as well as the parents' chat?\nstudent: So I picked a name. I got my younger brother and that's it\nstudent: Oh my\nstudent: The parents' chats\nteacher: Nice! I didn't know you had a brother!\nstudent: The viber crowd\nstudent: crowd\nteacher: The parents' chat is a dragon lair\nstudent: )))))\nteacher: enter at your own risk\nstudent: I have a couple of brothers, a couple of sisters, from different mothers and misters))))\nteacher: :)) that's nice!\nteacher: It's only Emily and me with us, no cousins\nstudent: I've been told the chats are terrible...horrible places\nstudent: I guess I'll have to see for myself\nteacher: Yes, cherish the few years before you have to do it :))\nstudent: Sometimes, having just one sibling is a blessing you know)))\nstudent: Oh I will definitely cherish these moments of tranquility\nteacher: I bet, definitely two sides to this particular coin!\nstudent: Indeed\nteacher: Has Sophia got an army of cousins then?\nstudent: Sorry, my dad called\nteacher: no problem\nstudent: All my brothers and sisters are younger than me so still no cousins in sight for Sophia))\nstudent: *are\nteacher: Oh I see! Somehow I was under the impression you had an elder sister. Never mind!\nstudent: She compensates with plenty of friends\nteacher: I'm sure!\nstudent: I am the elder sister *cries*\nstudent: )))))\nteacher: Haha, me too! sob sob\nstudent: I sometimes wish I weren't\nstudent: You can relate!\nteacher: Do you think there's truth to the correlation between birth order and personality?\nstudent: In a way yes\nstudent: In particular, how a person handles stress and responsibility\nteacher: I think I know what you mean, but for the sake of writing practice I'm going to ask you to elaborate :)\nstudent: If you're the eldest, you're responsible for yourself as well as for the younger sibling. You shouldn't be but the rough reality of most families is that you are. And it forms you\nstudent: ... shapes your personality. You try to be stronger, more determined and set an example\nteacher: Oh yes, I know what you mean! In an ideal world, the eldest would still be able to be a child and not look after the younger siblings, but like you say, the harsh reality\nstudent: Exactly.\nstudent: My mom and step-father worked non-stop\nstudent: in the 90-s\nteacher: I think it's a generational / cultural thing too. I think (and hope) that now elder siblings do not have to look after the younger ones as much\nstudent: I really hope so too\nteacher: Yes, this is actually classes as a 'young carer' now, a role a child isn't meant to play!\nstudent: I think that a child in their teens is the most vulnerable\nteacher: Definitely, because they are 'supposed' to be responsible by that age\nstudent: And I was a teenager when I had suddenly been given all this unwanted responsibility\nstudent: It was really hard for me and messed up with my self-perception\nstudent: messed up my self-perception\nteacher: Yes, I had to look after a 3-year-old Emily when I was 10, I remember that well. But I would never trust a 10-year-old with a my own 3-year-old\nteacher: You need a certain level of maturity\nstudent: Neither would I!\nteacher: But it seemed like a perfectly natural thing to do for my parents\nstudent: Desperate times call for desperate measures I guess\nstudent: Yes. Back then they didn't see it as a problem at all\nstudent: Now that my mom has been a therapist and studied psychology she looks at it differently.\nteacher: We watched 'Jaws' a few months ago, and I was struck by the fact that, like, an 8-year-old looks after a 4-year-old at the seaside, with a monstrous shark lurking in the water\nteacher: Yes, I bet!\nstudent: The scariest moment of the movie, right? )))))\nteacher: Absolutely! And what do the parents do? They yell at the kids out of the window not to go sailing in a boat!\nteacher: Even without the shark, if there were two under-tens by the water unsupervised, people would call the police in this country\nstudent: Oh well, the standard reaction from a lot of parents: kid in danger... yell at him to make him feel even worse\nteacher: But then, we're all 'millenial snowflakes' and 'helicopter parents' and not letting our children experience the world\nteacher: Yes, exactly, blame the kid!\nstudent: This, too.\nstudent: There should be a balance somewhere))))\nstudent: I don't know where\nteacher: I think we're doing the right thing though. Not exactly a sphere where we can affor mistakes\nteacher: *afford\nstudent: Petranovska says that it's logical... the helicopter parenting. And that with time it will subside a little\nstudent: It's like the other extreme.\nteacher: And the people who criticize it have been hardened by life and lash out\nteacher: Oh, I like her, but I haven't read that bit\nstudent: It was in one of her streams\nstudent: I'll look it up for you\nteacher: Yes, very reasonable\nteacher: Thank you :)\nstudent: She is super cool\nteacher: Oh, she is wonderful!\nstudent: Every mom-to-be should at least read her book on parenting, I think.\nteacher: I completely agree\nstudent: Let me digress a little\nteacher: Ok, shall we sink our teeth into some CPE stuff?\nteacher: Oh, go on :)\nstudent: I remembered what I've always wanted to ask you\nstudent: What's the English for \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0443\u044f \u0432\u043e\u0434\u044b \u0438\u0437 \u043a\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0430?\nteacher: Hmm, let me think\nteacher: in what context, please?\nstudent: Sophia loves water, spends tones of time in the bathtub\nstudent: *water\nteacher: the flow of water from the tap\nstudent: She likes to play with the flow, fill up her little containers\nstudent: the flow! thanks\nstudent: and if it's real strong\nstudent: does it become a jet?\nteacher: Oh lovely, Caleb loves that too\nteacher: Yes, it can be a jet! If it's really forceful\nstudent: ))) I think Caleb and Sophia might get along ))\nteacher: or a drip, if it's the opposite\nstudent: And what about a stream?\nteacher: Hopefully they can meet each other one day!\nstudent: Do you use that one?\nteacher: Oh yes, a stream, definitely\nstudent: Hopefully, yes!\nteacher: I think 'stream' will work better in your sentence, actually\nteacher: she like to play with the stream of water coming out of the tap\nteacher: or faucet, obviously :)\nstudent: so a drip if it's very weak, then a stream... then maybe a flow and a jet\nstudent: Great!\nstudent: Thank you! A stream it is then.\nteacher: Yes, makes sense!\nteacher: Ok, we got to the reading part in the test\nstudent: We discussed it with Alexandre many times but decided that only a native speaker can really know how and when to  use these terms\nstudent: Sure.\nstudent: Let me open the file\nteacher: Yes, those are tricky little things!\nstudent: Ok. Opened it\nteacher: Even a 9 at IELTS or a CPE won't give you those, actually. The everyday little words\nstudent: Oh yes!\nstudent: This is harder than any CPE ))))\nteacher: Thanks, page 8. Lucy gets a new job. The text is quite challenging actually I think, don't be daunted, ok? You don't need to understand every word, just be able to answer the questions. Can you read the text and let me know when you're done? And then we can take the questions one by one\nstudent: Sure! I'm on it\nstudent: ok ready\nstudent: 31 C\nteacher: Yes, well done! I didn't get that one right, tbh))\nstudent: 32 C\nteacher: yes!\nstudent: 33 D\nteacher: yes)\nstudent: 34 A\nteacher: no, what would be your second choice?\nstudent: B\nteacher: yes, B\nteacher: Can you see why?\nstudent: Yeah, I hesitated with this one\nteacher: fair enough\nstudent: Why... Well, because she bases Lucy's ability to be a successful journalist on her good essays at school\nteacher: Yes, exactly!\nstudent: #ERROR!\nstudent: yay\nstudent: 35 A\nteacher: correct!\nstudent: 36 C\nteacher: Yes! Very very well done, Emma Smith :)\nstudent: Thank you!\nteacher: and good time, too :)\nstudent: Still, one mistake\nteacher: You don't have to get 100% to pass\nteacher: There's a range, I'll look it up for you\nstudent: I know)\nstudent: Thank you!\nstudent: Do I get any homework?\nteacher: Something like, 70-80% is C, 80-90% is B etc\nstudent: I see. Ok!\nteacher: But my bands are likely to be off, don't trust that! I'll look it up!\nteacher: You can finish the reading if you have the time\nstudent: No worries. I'm sure your bands are precise\nstudent: OK! Deal\nteacher: Noo, it's a while since I took CPE, I'll look it up\nstudent: #ERROR!\nstudent: Have a great day!\nteacher: Sure, take care, speak to you next week!\nstudent: And a wonderful week... of card signing and gift-wrapping )))\nstudent: See you soon!",
    "student: Hi, Ms. Rodriguez!\nteacher: Hiya!\nteacher: Oh my, this time I couldn't type my name :)\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: Fine, thank you )\nstudent: How are you?\nteacher: Good, thank you!\nteacher: How are you feeling? Still tired?\nstudent: Yes, I am\nstudent: Unfortunately (\nstudent: I think it's because of the pills\nteacher: Oh no, so sorry to hear that!\nstudent: I think it will be better when I stop with them\nstudent: Don't worry )\nteacher: Hope you feel better soon!\nstudent: Thank you *\nstudent: But today I've had my yoga lesson\nteacher: We're in the full Christmas preparation mode. This week, I'm starting to make a stollen. Do you know 'a stollen'? A German Christmas bread\nstudent: I've really enjoyed it\nteacher: Oh good! Are you enjoying yoga more than when you first began?\nstudent: Yes! I know! It looks so christmassy\nstudent: Ah, sorry\nstudent: sorry\nstudent: It wasn't yoga\nstudent: today it has been pilates ))))\nstudent: But I like it\nstudent: I feel like I'm getting better at it\nstudent: It's a very good feeling )\nstudent: a very good feeling ))\nteacher: Ah, I see! I keep meaning to try it. I've been really into dance tutorials recently!\nteacher: Beginner dance tutorials :)\nteacher: it's such a fun lockdown-friendly way to exercise\nteacher: Good correction! the article\nstudent: keep meaning?\nstudent: I've been really into\nstudent: ? )\nteacher: If a person keeps meaning to do something, they have wanted to do something for a long time but haven't actually done it\nteacher: I keep meaning to clean out my kitchen cupboards))\nteacher: I keep meaning to read Moby Dick\nstudent: haha\nteacher: :) yes, it's a very useful one\nstudent: I keep meaning to do lots of things in my life )))\nteacher: That's it!\nteacher: to be into something = to like something, especially as a hobby, when you enjoy doing something\nteacher: I'm into gardening, for example\nteacher: A person can be into detective stories, Tom Cruise movies - whatever\nteacher: maybe someone can even be into Moby Dick :)\nstudent: haha\nteacher: What are you into?\nstudent: I'm into pilates and yoga now\nstudent: I'm into English\nteacher: Definitely!\nstudent: I was into Queen's Gambit )\nteacher: Oh yes, I was into this one too! Such a good show\nteacher: with a happy ending :)\nstudent: Actually\nstudent: I've discussed it with my friend and student\nteacher: What did they think?\nstudent: That French guy\nstudent: And he asked me a good question\nstudent: He told me\nstudent: I wonder if those Soviet people really were waiting for her in Moscow\nstudent: It was the period of the Cold War\nstudent: What do you think?\nteacher: Oh, the KGB taxi driver?\nteacher: or the people who wanted her autographs?\nstudent: second ones\nteacher: *taxi driver\nstudent: like fans\nstudent: What do you think, could it be a real situation?\nstudent: I think so\nstudent: *could it be THE real situation?\nteacher: Hmm, but you know how people used to sneak Deep Purple and Beatles records into the Soviet Union, and secretly listened to BBC on their radios\nteacher: another good correction :)\nteacher: I think people secretly loved everything foreign, and then in public said they only loved Soviet things :)\nstudent: Yes, I think it's more realistic than the uniform of a Soviet stewardess )\nteacher: Of course, some people were fanatical about everything Soviet\nteacher: Yes, definitely. I think it's a good one to ask our parents about\nstudent: I think he was not sure if the Soviet Government would have let people stay and wait for an American girl\nstudent: *lets\nstudent: hm\nstudent: past form\nteacher: Yes, I see. Well, I suppose they couldn't control everyting. The Beatles visited USSR, and people adored them\nteacher: let-let-let\nteacher: so the past form is 'let', you were right\nstudent: so first option was the right one )))\nteacher: yes!\nstudent: as usual\nstudent: I've done\nstudent: then I'm hesitating\nstudent: ))\nteacher: and you know how people were crazy about jeans and things like that\nstudent: Yes! So I think that it could be in the real life\nteacher: and Gone With The Wind :)\nstudent: I mean the crowd\nteacher: Just trying to think of examples of American things that people liked. The Beatles weren't American, obviously :)\nstudent: Actually I've never understood it ))\nstudent: I mean Gone with The Wind\nteacher: I think it's the same in Russia now. On TV, the USA is blamed for everything and many people do believe it, but in practice people love American movies, actors etc. and want to move there\nstudent: It's not my favorite story )\nteacher: What do you dislike about it?\nstudent: I'm just not crazy about the story\nstudent: )\nteacher: Fair enough! It's not my favourite either!\nstudent: Not bad, but.. )\nteacher: If the Queen's Gambit was more realistic, the stewardess wouldn't wear an ugly uniform in it\nteacher: This is a way to talk about 'the unreal present or future'\nstudent: Moby Dick is much better ))))))\nstudent: Dick\nteacher: things in the present or future that are not what is actually true\nstudent: It's a joke ))\nteacher: But you know, people like to think about fantasy things))\nteacher: Oh, have you read Moby Dick?\nstudent: no ))\nteacher: Neither have I :)\nteacher: This is called 'second conditional'\nstudent: Actually\nstudent: It's funny\nteacher: If Past Simple, would / could / might Vinfinitive\nstudent: I wanted to type that I don't like Jack London either\nstudent: But it's not his book ))))\nteacher: Oh, I liked Jack London when I was young!\nstudent: Ok! It's about the 'second conditional'\nstudent: Adam likes him\nstudent: I don't like him actually (\nteacher: Yes, this is another use for the modal verbs 'would / could / might'\nstudent: It's quite boring to me\nteacher: Just like with modal verbs of deduction, you think about what 'might' happen, but you can't be sure, because it's a fantasy situation\nstudent: I like Dostoevsky for example\nstudent: He is much funnier ))))\nteacher: Oh reallly? Dostoevsky is not something I would read for pleasure! But read most his novels at school\nteacher: Funnier? I never thought of Dostoevsky as a funny guy :)\nstudent: haha\nstudent: it was a joke\nteacher: :))\nstudent: I mean saying Jack London is boring and then saying that Dostoevsky is better\nteacher: If Dostoevsky was a bit funnier, I would probably like him!\nstudent: I have to presume (?) that Dostoevsky is not boring ))))\nstudent: But it's not true )\nteacher: Well, I suppose he is not boring. It's just that everyone suffers in his books\nstudent: Yes!!\nstudent: I liked him when I was a student\nstudent: But now I prefer to read something lighter\nstudent: Is it the right expression?\nteacher: One thing I realized quite recently about Dostoevsky is that he was a Russian chauvinist\nteacher: something lighter, I would say\nstudent: Yes! Thank you!\nteacher: Like, he believed that only Russian people could be spiritual\nstudent: Ok\nstudent: And what about Brodsky for example\nstudent: Same story\nteacher: But I didn't think about that before!\nteacher: Yes, Brodsky too! Despite the fact that Russia put him in prison and then sent him out of the country\nstudent: Sure!!\nstudent: Strange people\nteacher: Definitely!\nstudent: Ok\nstudent: sorry for interrupting you\nteacher: But talented authors\nteacher: It's ok, it's fun to talk!\nstudent: It was literaturnaya minutka )))))\nteacher: If Moby Dick was a bit shorter, I would read it :)\nstudent: oh! Sorry\nteacher: Definitely :)) I enjoyed it :))\nteacher: No problem, this program does it if the Internet is not great\nstudent: If I had more time, I would finish that Boris book about Churchill )))\nteacher: Haha, yes! 'I would finish'\nstudent: Or more desire )))\nstudent: Ah! Yes! Sorry\nstudent: sure\nteacher: exactly! It's not very good then? The book?\nstudent: Would finish\nstudent: I like it\nstudent: It's very interesting\nstudent: I think Boris is a good writer\nstudent: Unfortunately I'm reading it not in the original language\nstudent: It's a Ukrainian translation\nteacher: Oh I see! Because I prepared to write a sentence 'If Boris was a better writer, maybe he wouldn't want to be politician. And the world would be a better place' :)))\nstudent: ahaha\nstudent: But he does\nstudent: Or he is?\nteacher: But he does. He wants to be a politician\nstudent: I don't know about his other books, but I really like this one\nstudent: the others books?\nteacher: Yes, he is a fan of Churchill, isn't he? Some people think he thinks he is like Churchill :)\nteacher: his other books\nstudent: haha\nstudent: Ok\nstudent: I thought about it\nstudent: I think now he is even more sure of it\nteacher: because of the pandemic?\nstudent: It's like a war with Covid now\nstudent: yes!\nteacher: that's it!\nstudent: But where is his hat ))\nteacher: Well, today's a big day for him. He is in Brussels, trying to negotiate a Brexit deal. If he fails, we will crash out of the EU on December 31, and that will be very bad indeed\nteacher: as well as his cigar and whisky :)\nstudent: haha\nstudent: crash out of\nteacher: Well, the UK was part of the EU, and now we could leave nicely, with all the necessary contracts\nteacher: or we could crash out of it\nteacher: no contracts or deals and an economic crisis :)\nstudent: Oh no!\nteacher: Yes, it's not looking good!\nteacher: Actually, in classical English, we would use 'were' instead of 'was' in the second conditional\nteacher: If I were the Queen, I would stop Brexit\nteacher: instead of 'I was\nteacher: But now, people use 'was' in the second conditional too\nteacher: especially 'if he/ she was'\nteacher: But 'if I were' is still very much in use\nstudent: Ok!\nstudent: It's quite confusing )\nteacher: I know! I will send you an exercise as homework\nstudent: Sure!\nteacher: as well as a song from a TV series that my sister and I like (it's a musical), there's a very good example of second conditional there))\nteacher: For now, let's practice 'if I were'. If you were able to travel this year, where would you go?\nstudent: If I were able to travel in 2020, I would go to Italy! I love it and miss it\nstudent: Ok! And if I had a visa, I would go to your garden ))\nstudent: *if I had..\nteacher: Oh! I bet! You will love the first episode of Salt Fat Acid Heat, it's all about Italy\nteacher: Very good example! I hope it can happen soon! :)\nstudent: Have you been to Italy before?\nteacher: No, unfortunately! But I can't go anywhere until I've been to France. If it was up to me, I would prefer to go to Italy, but my best friend from school lives in Paris and she's been inviting me for years now\nteacher: But something always gets in the way!\nstudent: Oh no!\nteacher: We were planning to go this summer finally, but alas :))\nstudent: Ok, I let you go to France\nstudent: ))\nstudent: But then please go to Italy )\nteacher: Ok! :))\nstudent: Alas )))\nteacher: Oh definetely! I'd love that!\nteacher: *definitely\nstudent: The best weather, the best cuisine and the best architecture\nteacher: Ah, I bet!\nstudent: And I love the people\nteacher: It's 'cuisine', not kitchen, actually\nteacher: I know it's the same word in Russian)\nstudent: They are very open )\nteacher: let me find the transcription\nteacher: /kw\u026a\u02c8zi\u02d0n/\nstudent: Oh, sorry! Cuisine!\nteacher: You kind of pronounce 'cuisine' the French way\nteacher: Is this the French way? I'm not sure now\nstudent: I think so\nteacher: but yes, Ukrainian / Italian / French cuisine\nteacher: and English cuisine\nstudent: ok!\nteacher: fish and chips)))\nstudent: porridge ))\nteacher: I'm being unfair now, there are some lovely chefs in the UK\nteacher: But traditional English food is very simple as you know\nstudent: I like the UK cuisine\nteacher: What's your favourite dish?\nstudent: Not for every day but I still like it\nteacher: I like English desserts, they are lovely)\nstudent: English breakfast!!!!!\nstudent: )\nstudent: I love it so much! )\nteacher: Oh really? Cool! Sausages and bacon and eggs?\nstudent: Yes!\nteacher: and baked beans))\nstudent: And I like the full version\nstudent: beans yes\nstudent: and that thing\nteacher: with grilled tomatoes!

I like black pudding )))))))\nstudent: Sorry ))\nstudent: But it's a rare thing\nstudent: I think\nteacher: I've never tried it here because I hate krovyanka\nstudent: So eggs, Bacon, sausages, tomato and beans )\nstudent: Just try it\nteacher: Ah, talking about food and books. One of the things I enjoy about chatting with you :)\nstudent: I hate krovyanka\nstudent: I can't eat it\nstudent: But black pudding is different\nstudent: Just try it )\nstudent: And give me your opinion )\nteacher: Hmmm, maybe I will, I can't promise\nteacher: will do :)\nstudent: ok ))\nteacher: Anyway, I've got to let you go! I'll send you the homework))\nstudent: Thank you\nstudent: Lovely chat\nstudent: See you!\nteacher: My pleasure! Yes!\nteacher: Bye :)\nstudent: Bye! )",
    "student: Hello, Ms. Taylor.\nteacher: Hi Aiden!\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: I'm sorry I didn't have time to chat with you on Monday this week.\nstudent: I'm OK.\nstudent: Thanks\nteacher: No problem! Life gets in the way\nteacher: How's your week? Sounds like it has been very busy?\nstudent: Yes. Actually I was really busy the other day.\nstudent: But now I'm OK.\nteacher: I see! What type of AI are you actually working with?\nstudent: In my work, we use machine learning algorithms to calculate the risk to customers.\nstudent: Financial risk\nteacher: Ok, interesting! Which customers?\nstudent: We concentrate on customers who buy things online or who want to buy things in installments.\nteacher: oh, do you mean they pay in instalments? in parts rather than the whole sum?\nstudent: JD company in China is like the Amazon website in the UK.\nstudent: Yes. Pay in installments\nteacher: Ah, ok!\nteacher: So you're calculating the risk to customers who choose to pay for good in instalments?\nteacher: or your AI does\nteacher: *for goods\nstudent: We use algorithms which come from AI to do this job.\nteacher: I see, interesting!\nteacher: JD is a sports shop in the UK :)\nstudent: Haha. OK.\nteacher: Pay in installments' is spelled with double ll in US English and only one l in UK English ('pay in instalments')\nteacher: Yes, a place where people go to buy trainers :)\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: Are you looking forward to the weekend?\nstudent: Yes. This weekend I'm going to my parents' place.\nstudent: I haven\u2019t been to see my parents for two months.\nteacher: Ok, is this your plan or something you have just decided to do? :)\nteacher: Oh, I see! Sounds lovely, hope you have a great time!\nstudent: I have already bought the train tickets.\nteacher: Ok, so it's a plan. Do you remember the ways to talk about plans?\nteacher: grammatically\nstudent: I'm going to my parents' place at 19:00 on Friday this week.\nteacher: Remember we were talking about present continous / going to for plans?\nteacher: For example, this weekend I'm going to bake a cake\nteacher: I'm going to take my son for a swim at the swimming pool\nstudent: Yes. We use 'present continuous' with scheduled time.\nstudent: Right?\nteacher: Not quite! We use present simple for schedules. For example, I start work at 10 am tomorrow\nteacher: we use present continous for plans\nteacher: I'm going to buy a Christmas present for my husband this weekend\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: this is actually an example with 'going to'\nteacher: I'm calling my friend on Skype tonight\nteacher: My friend and I have arranged to call on Skype, it's our plan\nteacher: How would you change your sentence about going to your parents'?\nstudent: I'm going to my parents' place on Friday.\nteacher: Yes! I like it))\nstudent: OR I will go to my parents' place on Friday. Right?\nteacher: We use will for something we've just decided to do\nteacher: Oh, you know what, I think I'll call my parents!\nteacher: will' shows that I've just decided to call my parents, it's not something I've been planning to do\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: and you can use 'will' with phrases like 'I think / I hope'\nteacher: I hope we will fix climate change problems soon\nteacher: I think Christmas will be different this year\nteacher: things like this\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: Ok! Shall we look at another B2 writing task?\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: This is one of the options for Part 2 writing. An informal email\nteacher: Have you got the PDF handy?\nstudent: Yes. I have opened it.\nteacher: Lovely, could you go to page 3? It's task 4\nstudent: Write an email.\nteacher: Yes, you received an email from David and need to write back to him\nteacher: How would you start your email?\nstudent: Dear David,\nteacher: Ok, but also, he is your friend, so maybe something less formal like, Hi David\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: I will give you an example. When I talk to the HR department at work (human resources), I don't know the people there and I write very formally to them\nteacher: I start with Dear (name)\nteacher: and they answer with Dear Ms. Taylor\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: But when I talk to my boss, I just write 'Hi (name)'\nteacher: Even though he is my boss, not my friend\nteacher: Just an example about the UK, but it might be very different in China, I don't know!\nteacher: But you would definitely not write 'Dear' to you friend :)\nstudent: Yes.\nteacher: Ok! What would you write next?\nstudent: It sounds great that you are going to have a holiday in my city.\nstudent: you\nstudent: I don\u2019t know if I should write the real 'places', like Beijing, or just use 'my place'.\nteacher: Ok, great reaction to his email, I like it. The only problem is, is David going to to visit? Could you re-read the task?\nteacher: Feel free to write Beijing! It will be easier for you to talk about the real place\nstudent: It's David's college friends.\nstudent: It sounds great that your friends are going to have a holiday in my city.\nteacher: Yes, perfect!\nteacher: Ok, and then you have to answer two questions. Places to visit in Beijing and best way to travel (car / bike / coach)\nteacher: A paragraph for each question would be logical\nteacher: Would you like to have a go at the first question?\nstudent: As you know, Beijing is the capital of China, so it's a really good choice for a holiday. There are a lot of places they can go. Let me introduce some of the places. If they want to feel the culture of Beijing, they can go somewhere like Wangfujing or Nanluoguxiang. In these places they can eat classical chinese snacks and see Chinese silk.\nteacher: Ok, thank you!\nteacher: Very good grammar, by the way!\nteacher: it's really a good choice for holiday --- it's a really good choice for A holiday\nstudent: Thanks. Actually I still have something to write about historic places, but the time is limited.\nteacher: What words do you think you could use instead of 'really good'? To show that you know interesting words in English\nstudent: It's a great choice for a holiday.\nteacher: Yes, definitely, you'll be able to add things later on\nteacher: Great, yes! Anything else?\nstudent: awesome?\nteacher: Yes!\nteacher: Absolutely, in an email to a friend\nteacher: also, excellent / brilliant\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: some kind of places --- some of the places / some places\nteacher: feel the culture' is not a great expression, I would go for 'experience the culture / explore the culture'\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: experience' has the same meaning as 'feel' but is a better choice of a word\nteacher: In these place they can eat the classical chinese snacks, see the chinese silk.\nteacher: I would put 'and' instead of a comma and get rid of articles\nteacher: you don't mean some concrete snacks, just general snacks\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: they can eat classic Chinese snacks and see Chinese silk\nteacher: Also, would 'food' be better than 'snacks'?\nstudent: Yes. 'food' is better in English.\nteacher: Yes, 'a snack' is something you eat between meals, like a biscuit or an apple or a packet of crisps\nstudent: In China we always say classic food as snacks, and food just means normal food.\nteacher: What are some common snacks in China?\nteacher: Ah, I didn't know that. So you use classic Chinese food as snacks, not for meals?\nstudent: Not for meals.\nstudent: Normally we don't eat anything before meals.\nteacher: You don't eat between meals? Do you only eat breakfast, lunch and dinner?\nstudent: for common snacks, I don't know how to say it in English.\nteacher: For example, I eat breakfast, lunch and dinner, but between meals I eat some chocolate, an apple or a banana\nteacher: Haha, we got stuck on cultural differences!\nteacher: Some chocolate, an apple and a banana are snacks for me, but pasta and porridge are meals\nstudent: I will check them after class.\nteacher: No worries! It's interesting to talk about these things. In some countries people snack more than in others!\nstudent: Yes. I think I haven\u2019t expressed the right meaning of 'snack' in China.\nteacher: Ok, if you have the time, will you write this email as homework? No rush, you can do it for Thursday instead of Monday. But most importantly, have a great time with your parents!\nstudent: OK. I will write this email, and send to you. Thanks\nteacher: Lovely, have a great weekend! Bye!\nstudent: Bye",
    "student: hi\nstudent: sorry for being late\nteacher: Hi Sara!\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: fine\nteacher: How's your week been so far?\nstudent: sad\nstudent: and boring\nstudent: as always\nteacher: Oh no, that's so sad!\nteacher: Are you looking forward to the weekend?\nstudent: yes\nstudent: I have only one lesson\nstudent: not two (on Sunday )\nstudent: so I want to see my friend\nteacher: Sounds good! You'll have a bit more time on your hands\nteacher: I hear there are two Christamasses in Ukraine now :)\nstudent: what do you mean?\nteacher: The 25th of December and the 7th of January are both public holidays, is that right?\nstudent: I don't celebrate on 25th December\nstudent: even 7th of January isn't\nstudent: a celebration for me\nstudent: just some nice food\nteacher: Fair enough!\nteacher: It's very similar in the UK. For some people, the religious meaning is of Christmas is important, but for most it's just an opportunity to exchange presents and eat nice food\nteacher: *sorry, 'the religious meaning of Christmas\nteacher: But New Year is much less of a celebration here than in Ukraine\nstudent: I know\nteacher: Even though maybe this time will be different. A lot of people are fed up with 2020 and hope 2021 will be better\nteacher: Ok, I've prepared a comic for you for today!\nteacher: Do you like comics?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Ok, what kind of comics do you usually read?\nstudent: some short ones on Instagram\nstudent: or sometimes I read long comics\nteacher: Ok, sure, they are also called 'cartoons'. A short comic, basically\nteacher: Well, no, that's not a great explanation. A cartoon is usually a picture with some speech bubbles that tells a joke\nteacher: But a comic is a story told in pictures, as you know\nteacher: Ok, well, this comic is a story of some young people and their relationships\nteacher: There are two boys, Sam and Fred. Sam sees Fred's girlfriend with another boy\nteacher: And Sam tries to decide whether he should tell Fred\nteacher: Do you think a friend should say what he saw in this situation?\nstudent: maybe first he can talk about it with this girl\nteacher: Good idea!\nteacher: Because how might Fred react?\nstudent: he might say that his brother is lying\nteacher: Ok, sure!\nteacher: Well, let's see what happened. I'm going to send you the link on Skype, can you watch the video, please?\nstudent: I watched\nteacher: Ok! So what happened?\nstudent: Fred made a mistake\nstudent: Laura had a twin sister\nteacher: Yes!\nstudent: and he thought is was Laura\nteacher: Well, Sam made a mistake, didn't he?\nstudent: Sam?\nstudent: oh yes\nteacher: Sam saw Fred's girlfriend with another boy, right?\nteacher: yes\nstudent: Sam\nteacher: Do you think it's too late for Fred to get his girlfriend back?\nstudent: no\nteacher: No?\nstudent: he can say sorry and explain the situation\nstudent: not late\nteacher: Yes, I think so too!\nteacher: Even though for some people it's extremely hard to say sorry and admit a mistake\nteacher: So maybe not))\nteacher: Ok, have you noticed lots of interesting phrasal verbs in this story?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: bump into; cheat on; mess around with; hang out with; get on well with; get over something; go on; make it up; cheer someone up, split up with, break up with; sort something out\nteacher: Do you know any of them?\nstudent: maybe I know all of them...\nstudent: you can check me\nteacher: Oh cool!\nteacher: let's see\nteacher: which one means 'spend time together with someone'\nteacher: ?\nstudent: hang out\nteacher: Good!\nteacher: make someone feel better?\nstudent: cheer up\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: which two mean 'to end a relationship'?\nstudent: split up\nteacher: yes, and also?\nstudent: get over?\nteacher: no, break up\nstudent: yes\nstudent: sorry\nteacher: well, they are the same in some way and different in another\nteacher: We can say, Fred and Laura broke up\nteacher: or Fred and Laura split up\nstudent: I know it\nteacher: But: Fred broke up with Laura\nteacher: Ok, and 'get over' actually means to stop being upset about something'\nstudent: yes\nteacher: For example, I couldn't find the tree I needed for my garden, I was really disappointed, but then I got over it\nteacher: Ok, can you have a go at the second exercise under the comic? The one that says 'phrasal verbs: gap fill - in context'\nstudent: 44177.0\nteacher: Oh, well done!\nteacher: wonderful\nteacher: So what would you in the same situation as Sam found himself in? Would you tell your friend?\nstudent: I've told you what I would do\nstudent: I would talk to my friend's partner and maybe then I would tell my friend about it\nteacher: Ok, why is that?\nteacher: The partner will just tell you it's none of your business :)\nstudent: so then I will tell my friend\nteacher: I see, logical!\nteacher: I will tell my friend, without 'to'\nteacher: Are you going to play Minecraft tonight?\nstudent: yesss\nteacher: Haha, do you play the survival mode?\nteacher: or creative?\nteacher: *in the survival mode\nstudent: we play on servers\nteacher: Oh, with other people?\nstudent: with a lot of other people\nteacher: with a lot of other people\nteacher: another = just 1\nteacher: another friend\nteacher: but other = many\nstudent: okie\nteacher: Do you team up with your friend? Or is everyone playing by themselves?\nstudent: we even have Internet friends\nteacher: Nice, where are they from?\nstudent: with my friend\nstudent: So, my like the closest friend is Emily\nstudent: I don't know his real name\nstudent: I just call him that\nteacher: Maybe it is his real name!\nstudent: no\nteacher: My son has two boys with this name in his class\nstudent: he is from Ukraine, and Emily is a name of a character from one game\nteacher: Aah, I see!\nteacher: makes sense\nteacher: Ok, I'll let you go enjoy your game - and your weekend!\nstudent: thank you!\nstudent: you too\nteacher: Thanks :) bye!\nstudent: thank for the lesson\nstudent: bye\nteacher: My pleasure)",
    "student: Hello, Mr. Sullivan.\nteacher: Hi Emily Johnston!\nteacher: Oh sorry, I forgot to enter my username\nteacher: How are you? How was your weekend at your parents'?\nstudent: It was great, thanks.\nteacher: Tell me a bit about it, please! In the past tense :)\nstudent: I sent you my homework from my yahoo email.\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: Yes, I saw it, we'll get to it in a minute, thank you\nstudent: I went home on Friday night, and my Mom cooked a lot of delicious food as usual.\nstudent: sorry, On Friday night.\nteacher: Good correction, well done!\nteacher: Oh, sounds wonderful!\nstudent: And I talked a lot with my parents about things like how my work is going, if it's cold in Beijing.\nteacher: I see! Sound like you had a lovely time!\nteacher: *sounds\nstudent: Yes. My parents are always happy when they see me at home.\nteacher: Yes, I bet!\nteacher: Is it far away from Beijing?\nstudent: Not so far.\nstudent: About 200 kilometers.\nteacher: And you have your amazingly fast trains in China\nstudent: My hometown is not big enough to have a fast train.\nteacher: Oh, your hometown is not big enough to have a fast train?\nteacher: That's a shame\nstudent: it's just a normal train which takes about two hours.\nteacher: Fair enough, I see!\nstudent: But there is going to be a fast train in about two years.\nteacher: Good news! Could you combine 'there is' and 'going to' in this sentence, please?\nteacher: But ___ ___ ___ to be a fast train in about two years\nstudent: There is going to be a fast train in my hometown in about two years.\nteacher: Nearly. There is going to be a fast train...\nteacher: What do you think will change for people in your hometown when there is a fast train?\nstudent: OK. I thought I was wrong.\nstudent: It will be convenient to travel to Beijing, which will take about 40 mins.\nteacher: Nice!\nstudent: But the price of houses in my hometown will be higher.\nteacher: So people could live in your hometown and commute to work in Beijing!\nteacher: Ah, yes, this is always the consequence of better transport connection!\nstudent: Beijing is so big, and most conpanies are in the centre of it.\nteacher: So the commute will actually take longer than 40 minutes?\nstudent: So the commute will depend on which area your company is located in.\nstudent: the commute time will depend on the position of your company.\nteacher: Yes, it makes sense!\nteacher: The verb we use here is 'take'. Something takes 40 minutes\nteacher: The train takes two hours. The commute takes forty minutes\nteacher: Doing this work will take me two weeks\nteacher: It sometimes takes an author years to write a novel\nteacher: How long does it take you to get to work?\nstudent: OK.\nstudent: It takes me 20 minutes to get to work.\nteacher: Ok, great!\nteacher: Ok, you did another excellent job with your homework!\nteacher: Hi David,  It sounds great that your friends are going to have a holiday in my city. As you know, Beijing is the capital of China, so it\u2019s an excellent choice for a holiday. There are a lot of places where they may want to visit, let me introduce some of them. If they want to experience the culture of China, they should go to somewhere like The Palace Museum and Nanluoguxiang where they can see the Chinese historical royal buildings and  eat the classic Chinese food. Also they can visit the Great Wall which is the symbol of Chinese history. And in the Great Wall, they can see the beatiful scenery of Beijing. By the way, because Beijing is one of the biggest cities in China, during the holiday, I think they can travel by subway. In Beijing Subway is so convinient that they can travel to almost all places they want. At last, hope they would have a great time in Beijing, if they have any problem, they can connect with me.     Thanks,     Emily Johnston\nteacher: This is a really good informal letter!\nstudent: Thanks.\nteacher: There are just a couple of problems with prepositions, one moment\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: I think 'classic Chinese food' is a good choice, because it can be a bit confusing with snacks, as we discovered last time!\nstudent: Yes. I think so.\nteacher: And ___ the Great Wall, they can see the beautiful scenery of Beijing\nteacher: I would say, FROM the Great Wall\nteacher: They have to climb to the Wall, and then see it from the wall\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: they should go to somewhere like The Palace Museum and Nanluoguxiang\nteacher: they should go somewhere, without 'to'\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: if you use the name of a place, you need 'to'. They should go to The Palace Museum\nteacher: but 'somewhere' swallows 'to'\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: There is a wrong spelling of 'convenient', but you spelled it correctly earlier on in the chat :) 'convenient'\nteacher: But great writing overall, and you answered all the questions in the task. Yay!\nteacher: I've got a B2 task for you to practise today. A multiple choice one. I'm going to copy the text here, and then I'm going to give you options for every question\nstudent: OK. Thanks a lot.\nteacher: It's called 'The Netherlands'. What is the word for a nationality, someone who comes from the Netherlands. Do you remember?\nstudent: Sorry, I can\u2019t remember clearly.\nteacher: No worries. Dutch. Someone who comes from this country is Dutch.\nteacher: Also, Dutch food etc.\nteacher: It's a bit unusual, because the words are so different\nteacher: Anyway, have a quick look through the text, and I'll send you the options for question 1\nteacher: Welcome to the Netherlands, a tiny country that only extends, at its broadest, 312 km north to south, and 264 km east to west - (1) ... the land area increases slightly each year as a (2) ... of continuous land reclamation and drainage. With a lot of heart and much to offer, 'Holland,' as it is (3) ... known to most of us abroad - a name stemming (4) ... its once most prominent provinces - has more going on per kilometre than most countries, and more English-speaking natives. You'll be impressed by its (5) ... cities and charmed by its countryside and villages, full of contrasts. From the exciting variety (6) ... offer, you could choose a romantic canal boat tour in Amsterdam, a Royal Tour by coach in The Hague, or a hydrofoil tour around the biggest harbour in the world - Rotterdam. In season you could visit the dazzling bulb fields, enjoy a full day on a boat, or take a bike tour through the pancake-flat countryside spiced with windmills. The possibilities are countless and the nationwide tourist office, which is on hand to give you information and (7) ... reservations. You'll have (8) ... language problems here, as the Dutch are true linguists and English is spoken here almost universally.\nteacher: 1. A) so B) despite C) in spite of D) although\nstudent: 1 B?\nteacher: No, what would be your second choice?\nstudent: D\nteacher: Yes, absolutely!\nteacher: although\nteacher: the country is this big, although we can't say exactly because the area increases each year\nteacher: despite / in spite of only work with a noun\nteacher: despite the fact that... / in spite of the fact that...\nstudent: OK.\nstudent: I thought b,c,d were all right.\nstudent: Now I know the difference between them.\nteacher: I see! You were right in that you need to contrast the two parts of the sentences\nteacher: 2. A) whole B) consequently C) rule D) result\nstudent: D\nteacher: Correct!\nteacher: 3. A) regularly B) occasionally C) commonly D) unusually\nstudent: C\nteacher: correct! commonly known is an expression\nteacher: 4. A) in B) from C) on D) of\nstudent: B\nteacher: Correct! stem from\nteacher: 5. A) historic B) historical C) historically D) historian\nstudent: A\nteacher: Yes!\nteacher: well done\nteacher: 6. A) at B) in C) on D) for\nstudent: Don\u2019t know, I guess B?\nteacher: The expression is 'on offer'\nteacher: Something can be 'on offer' in a shop, for example\nteacher: 7. A) sit B) catch C) do D) make\nstudent: D\nteacher: Yes, correct!\nteacher: make a reservation = book\nteacher: We can book a table at a restaurant / make a reservation at a restaurant\nteacher: Ok, one last!\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: 8. A) few B) a few C) little D) a little\nstudent: A\nteacher: Yes, well done!\nteacher: What's the difference between 'few' and 'a few' here?\nstudent: Because English is widely used in the place, there are no problems ...\nteacher: Exactly! 'few' means not many here\nteacher: But 'a few' means 'some'\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: For example, 'I have few friends' means I don't have enough friends\nstudent: so a few &gt;= a little ?\nteacher: But 'I have A few friends' means I have some friends, there's a positive meaning\nteacher: There is a difference between 'few' and 'little'!\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: But it's about whether the noun is countable or uncountable\nteacher: I have a few friends and a little money\nteacher: friends = countable noun, money = uncountable noun\nstudent: a few != some?\nteacher: Yes, correct!\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: I have some friends and some money :) 'some' works for both countable and uncountable\nteacher: Can you fill in the gaps, please? I have a ___ books. I like a ___ milk in my tea. I feel a ___ upset. It only costs a ___ pounds.\nteacher: few / little\nstudent: few,little,little,few\nteacher: Yes, absolutely correct!\nteacher: As you can see, 'upset' is an adjective, not a noun\nteacher: But we use 'little' here too\nstudent: Yes.\nteacher: Ok, great\nstudent: Can you tell me the difference between 'historic' and 'historical'?\nteacher: One of my friends is Dutch, and he hates it when people call his country 'Holland'. He always corrects people that it's 'the Netherlands' :)\nteacher: Very good question, one second!\nteacher: historic = important in history\nteacher: It was a historic day in the history of my country (because something really important happened)\nteacher: a historic vote\nteacher: historic election\nteacher: historical = connected with a study of history\nteacher: a historical document (we learn a lot of history from it)\nteacher: a historical novel (a novel about history)\nstudent: So historic means important in history, historical just means history?\nteacher: Yes, historical is about history as a study of the past\nteacher: let me think of more examples\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: If we say a city is historic, a lot of important things happened there\nteacher: Cambridge is a historic city, the home of the famous university.\nteacher: But my little town is not historic. It has never been an important place. It has some historical buildings (from the past)\nstudent: Yes. We stress the importance of the city if we say the city is historic\nteacher: Yes, absolutely!\nteacher: Is your hometown historic? Was it important in history?\nstudent: I think I understand the difference.\nstudent: No. My hometown is a small city.\nteacher: I see!\nteacher: Ok, lovely, I'll let you go now. Speak to you on Thursday, have a lovely week! Well done today!\nstudent: OK. Thanks.\nstudent: See you on Thursday.\nteacher: Bye!\nstudent: Bye!",

I've sorted out all Christmas presents,which was the stressful part\nteacher: and now I'm just looking forward to the festive season!\nstudent: festive?\nteacher: yes, festival = noun, festive = adjective\nteacher: Good question!\nteacher: The season of festivals (Xmas and New Year) = the festive season\nstudent: oh\nteacher: in this culture, obviously. In different countries there will be different festive seasons\nteacher: Yes, you can also say 'a festive mood / spirit'\nteacher: festive decorations\nteacher: festive food\nteacher: things like that\nteacher: fEstive, the stress is on the first syllable\nteacher: When is the start of your school holidays?\nstudent: on the 25th\nteacher: Oh, I see, it's sooner here, the 18th\nteacher: We'll stop with our chats for the holiday, actually, but we can talk about it on Friday\nteacher: Are you looking forward to your holiday?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Why? :)\nstudent: I want to finally see my friends\nstudent: I haven't seen anybody for 3 weeks\nteacher: I see! Let's think about grammar here\nteacher: I ____ _____ anybody for 3 weeks\nstudent: haven't seen\nteacher: Yes, that's much better :)\nteacher: So, your friends are not your classmates then?\nstudent: not really\nstudent: my closest friends no\nteacher: Ok, sure\nteacher: Oh, did you see how I used a phrasal verb from last time there? I've SORTED OUT all Christmas presents\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Yes, = I've solved that problem, I've done this task\nteacher: Ok, a quick exercise to practise the phrasal verbs from the last time. I'll give you sentences in which a preposition is missing from the phrasal verb. Can you fill the preposition?\nteacher: She was obviously lying. She\u2019d made ___    a story about how she met Lady Gaga after the concert and gone to a party with her.\nstudent: up\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: He was devastated that nobody liked his book. It took him months to get     it, but he's OK now - he's writing another one!\nteacher: sorry, to get ____ it\nstudent: over\nteacher: Yes!\nteacher: I knew something weird was going ___     , but she wouldn't tell me what was happening.\nstudent: on\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: My grandma was ill and fed up, so I showed her my funny holiday photos to cheer her ___\nstudent: up\nteacher: yes :)\nteacher: Why don\u2019t you hang ___    with me for a while? I haven't seen you for ages and I want to spend some time with you.\nstudent: out\nteacher: yes\nteacher: I don't really get   ___ with my stepdad. He hardly ever talks to me and I don\u2019t like his jokes.\nstudent: on well\nteacher: I don\u2019t want to speak to Anna any more! If I bump ___ her in the street, I\u2019ll just ignore her.\nteacher: Yes, get on well, or just 'get on'\nstudent: into\nteacher: yes, good!\nteacher: He cheated     his girlfriend, but then he felt really guilty.\nteacher: sorry, cheated ___\nstudent: on\nteacher: yes, good!\nteacher: Have you heard? Jacob and Amelia have broken  ___    ! They\u2019ve been together for ages. I\u2019m really surprised.\nstudent: up\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: The tickets had the wrong names on and they nearly didn\u2019t let us on the plane. Luckily my friend speaks really good English and she managed to sort it __\nstudent: out\nteacher: Yes, very well done! :)\nteacher: So, we've got: make up (a story); get over something; go on; cheer up; hang out with; get on (well) with; bump into; cheat on\nteacher: break up and sort out\nteacher: Which one means 'to recover from something' (emotional upset / an illness)?\nstudent: get over\nteacher: Yes, good! Now you give me a definition, please, and I'll try and guess the phrasal verb\nstudent: when you spend time with someone\nteacher: hang out with?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: :)\nteacher: which one means 'to see someone by accident'\nstudent: bump into\nteacher: Yes, good! your turn\nstudent: when you try to help someone to be in a good mood\nteacher: cheer someone up\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Or you can say to someone, 'Cheer up!' Not that it always works :)\nstudent: of course\nteacher: Ok, have a good relationship with someone?\nstudent: get on well\nteacher: Yes, good!\nteacher: your turn :)\nstudent: when you're in a relationship with someone, but you hang out with another person\nteacher: you cheat on them?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Ok, and finally, to invent (a story)?\nstudent: make up\nteacher: Yes :)\nteacher: If you're having a bad day, what cheers you up?\nstudent: coming home and just chilling out\nteacher: Aww, good! another phrasal verb :)\nteacher: By the way, another meaning of 'cheat' is to do something to get an unfair advantage\nteacher: For example, if, during a test at school, a student keeps secretly looking at their notes, they are cheating on a test\nstudent: yes\nstudent: I know\nteacher: Great :)\nteacher: Do people still cheat on tests at school, like when I was young?\nstudent: of course\nteacher: Oh really? How do they do it?\nstudent: I also do that sometimes\nteacher: Haha, what's your favourite method?\nstudent: I like to ask my bf from another class to give me answers\nteacher: Ooh, naughty!\nteacher: Are their any specific subjects where you cheat and where you don't?\nstudent: last year it was biology\nteacher: Did you cheat there or not then?\nstudent: while it was lockdown\nstudent: I just asked my bf for answers\nstudent: and yesterday it was chemistry\nteacher: Oh, I remember you said, it used to be easy to cheat because you could use the books!\nteacher: Are there subjects where you never cheat?\nstudent: but yesterday we gave our phones to our teacher\nstudent: so I wrote everything by myself\nstudent: so I could only just check the answers\nstudent: they were correct\nteacher: Oh good!\nteacher: You would have been correct anyway :)\nteacher: So are there any subjects where you never cheat?\nstudent: and it was easy to cheat in history\nstudent: I don't cheat in math\nstudent: because like it doesn't even make any sense\nstudent: you just need to know how to do it\nteacher: You just need to know how to solve a math ____\nteacher: What's the word for a task in math?\nstudent: sorry I forgot\nstudent: I understand\nteacher: a math problem\nstudent: yesss\nteacher: yes :))\nteacher: Ok, let's throw in some old words!\nteacher: I'm sure you're excited :)\nteacher: What does 'annual' mean?\nstudent: every year\nteacher: Yes, good!\nteacher: What about\nteacher: equality'?\nteacher: It's a human right, remember?\nstudent: mmm\nteacher: Ok, I'll give you a hint\nteacher: two plus two equals 4\nstudent: yeah\nteacher: If men and women have the same rights and opportunities, they are equal\nstudent: I understand\nteacher: They are not the same, but they are equal\nteacher: equality is the right of different people to have a similar social position and to be treated the same\nteacher: Remember we talked about it?\nstudent: yeah\nteacher: Ok, lovely!\nteacher: I'll let you go and chill :)\nstudent: okay\nstudent: bye\nteacher: I'll talk to you on Friday! Bye :)",
    "student: Sophia Miller\nstudent: oops\nteacher: Hi Sophia Miller!\nstudent: Hello Mrs. Johnson!\nstudent: I'm sorry for being late\nteacher: No worries :)\nstudent: I had a class of Russian with a student and he was half hour late (\nteacher: Oh no! Was it an online class?\nstudent: Yes. It was in Skype\nstudent: He's in Germany\nstudent: And forgot about the time difference\nteacher: I see! You certainly have an exciting job! (so do I I think :)\nstudent: Depends on the student))\nteacher: I wouldn't even know where to start if I was teaching Russian. I mean, Russian / Ukrainian words just change all the time\nstudent: That was me 6 years ago)))\nteacher: Well, I suppose this is the difference between a professional language teacher and a native speaker of the language\nstudent: I also couldn't figure out how to do it\nstudent: I did my homework by the way\nstudent: Right after our last lesson\nteacher: Oh lovely, I did the reading too :)\nstudent: The task seemed pretty challenging\nteacher: I've got the answer key, by the way, don't worry, I'm not just checking your answers against mine\nstudent: It is actually one of my least favourite tasks\nstudent: No worries at all)))\nteacher: Which one? the missing paragraphs one?\nstudent: Yours are as good as the answer keys\nstudent: Yes, the missing paragraphs\nteacher: I wish! I got a couple wrong with the missing paragraphs! Like you say, a tough task\nstudent: This type gets extra difficult starting from the Advanced level\nteacher: The trouble is, if you get just the one wrong, you're likely to get at least one more wrong too because you might have already used the paragraph you needed\nstudent: Exactly\nteacher: Ok, shall we have a look?\nstudent: Yes! Let me open the file\nstudent: ready\nstudent: Ok.\nstudent: 37 D\nteacher: yes!\nstudent: 38 H\nteacher: yes :)\nstudent: 39 F\nteacher: yes!\nstudent: 40 ......B\nteacher: yes!\nstudent: 41 A\nteacher: yes!\nstudent: 42 E\nteacher: yes!\nstudent: 43 G\nteacher: Yaaaay!\nstudent: WOW\nteacher: You did it!!!\nstudent: I was 100 per cent sure something was wrong\nteacher: Nope, you crushed it :)\nstudent: Wow\nstudent: #ERROR!\nstudent: I'm happy\nteacher: Well done! You should be!\nstudent: I do really hate those tasks though\nstudent: Emily Brooks can tell you how I struggled while completing it\nteacher: Haha, yes. My strategy when I was preparing for CPE was a lot of underlining\nteacher: with a pencil\nstudent: I need to print it then\nteacher: I would underline the words that link the two paragraphs (before and after)\nstudent: Yes!\nstudent: I do the same just in my head\nteacher: True! You also need to know whether your exam will be paper-based or computer-based\nteacher: Because obviously, there's no use getting used to underlining in  a computer-based exam\nstudent: Which one is more common?\nteacher: But I think a computer-based one allows you to drag-and-drop paragraphs, which can also be quite visually helpful\nteacher: I don't know what it's like in Kyiv now! I sat the paper-based one, but it was, like 10 years ago now\nstudent: That would be great if they do it\nteacher: It all depends on the exam centre and whether they have enough computers and which model they prefer\nstudent: I see\nstudent: Which center is the best for this type of exams?\nstudent: In your opinion\nteacher: British Council was the only one that offered CPE at the time, but Grade might do it now too\nstudent: Now there are plenty\nteacher: It shouldn't matter, the exam experience should be the same across the world, this is the job of an exam centre\nstudent: from what I've managed to find\nstudent: BC is the optimal choice I guess\nteacher: And Grade or the BC, you will probably get the same speaking examiners because there are very few examiners who are qualified to do CPE (Mark used to do it)\nteacher: I liked the BC, they had a nice cafe :)\nstudent: I see.\nteacher: the one in Podil\nteacher: But like I say, they were the only option\nstudent: Oh nice. A cafe! That's a definitive pro for me\nteacher: A bit of useless trivia: one of the CPE examiners in Kyiv is the wife of Andrei Kurkov, the writer\nstudent: Is he a famous writer?))\nteacher: I've never read him, to be honest! I keep meaning to. But I saw his books in English bookshops\nstudent: So he writes in English?\nteacher: Is he quite famous in Kyiv?\nstudent: Never heard of him\nteacher: Hmm, I presume they are translations, but I might be wrong! His wife is English, so he might be bilingual\nstudent: I'll look him up\nteacher: This is what Wiki has to say\nteacher: Andrey Yuryevich Kurkov is a Ukrainian novelist and an independent thinker who writes in Russian. He is the author of 19 novels, including the bestselling Death and the Penguin, 9 books for children, and about 20 documentary, fiction and TV movie scripts.\nteacher: An independent thinker! :))\nstudent: What a biography. Did his wife compose it? ))))\nteacher: I wonder that :))\nstudent: Interesting ))\nteacher: He's quite prolific it seems. Amazon.uk is offering me lots of books by him, now that I've googled him :)\nstudent: Amazon follows you\nteacher: Definitely!\nstudent: I saw a funny tik tok video a couple of days ago\nteacher: Oh, before we continue, I'll just mention that I'll take some time off (or more like Liam will be off starting from next week) and be back to chats from Monday January 4. I do understand this is bang in the middle of the festive period for you, so do let me know whether you'd like a class on January 6\nteacher: Tik tok! You're way more social media savvy than me!\nstudent: I saw it on IG\nstudent: Ok sure! Let's try the 6th\nteacher: See, I don't even know what IG is :)\nstudent: instagram\nteacher: Ah, ok! the Gram :))\nstudent: I hate tik tok actually\nteacher: Ok, Jan 6th!\nteacher: It's quite new, isn't it?\nstudent: Yes. The audiences there ... it's just sad.\nteacher: So is the idea that it's videos? Like insta, but videos?\nteacher: Why is it sad?\nstudent: Anyway, the video was about a wife who after seeing her husband leave his mobile phone on the table and go to the shower, takes the phone and talks to it\nstudent: to it*\nstudent: very slowly she says\nstudent: Buy flowers Kyiv' 'buy new Iphone 11 Kyiv centre' 'Beautiful roses Kyiv;\nstudent: trying to train the search engines\nstudent: so that later they can show her husband a targeted ad\nteacher: haha, oh goodness!\nteacher: now there's a new way to plant ideas into people's heads\nstudent: Smart, right?\nstudent: Now you know how to plant a gift idea into Mark's head\nteacher: Devious!\nteacher: Haha, I just ask :)\nstudent: I'll try it with Liam. See if it works))\nteacher: Let me know!\nstudent: Asking is always better!\nstudent: sure\nstudent: For the sake of the experiment\nteacher: in case he doesn't get the hint :)\nstudent: Liam is bad at hints\nstudent: He's bad even when I directly ask for something particular.\nteacher: :))) oh no!\nstudent: He just forgets what it was right away\nteacher: Aiden will have to train him up\nstudent: The mind of a simultaneous interpreter\nstudent: I guess\nteacher: Oh, true, he kind of clears the cash immediately?\nstudent: Aiden will persevere\nstudent: Exactly. That's what I call it too\nteacher: That's ___ I call it too\nstudent: what\nstudent: )) sorry\nteacher: yes :)\nteacher: no worries! I know it's hard!\nteacher: it's still hard for me to think of hair as 'it'\nteacher: I have to make a conscious effort\nstudent: Old habits die hard\nteacher: definitely!\nstudent: You want to say 'they'?\nteacher: Die hard, I wonder if Mark's going to make me watch it this Xmas. It's a Xmas movie in the UK!\nteacher: Yep!\nstudent: I know. My sis just told me yesterday that they watched it together with her boyfriend and decorated the Xtree\nteacher: Oh, where does she live? I forgot\nstudent: What movie is your Xmas movie?\nstudent: She lives in Kyiv now\nstudent: She used to live in London. And before that she'd lived in Boston\nteacher: Well, the kiddie ones, like the Grinch and Christmas Chronicles. Love Actually (soppy, I know!) and musicals (poor Mark!)\nstudent: Love Actually! My all-time favourite Xmas movie\nteacher: Snap! :))\nstudent: What about Home Alone?\nteacher: I've never watched it! Weird, I know! Maybe it's time\nstudent: Maybe instead of Die Hard?\nteacher: Maybe!\nstudent: The humour is pretty much on the same level\nteacher: Haha :))) excellent\nteacher: Yes, Die Hard for me is Snape crashing a Xmas party\nstudent: The 1 and the 2 are the only good ones\nstudent: ahahaha\nstudent: Oh yes, I forgot he was in it\nstudent: The German guy\nteacher: Yes :) Alan Rickman\nteacher: And in Love Actually too, actually!\nstudent: He's adorable\nteacher: I know it's a bit weird to practise speaking in this format, but shall we have a go at a couple of speaking questions from CPE?\nteacher: C2 Proficiency, I should say\nteacher: He is lovely, yes!\nstudent: The way he grunts -- I just love it\nteacher: He grunts?? Maybe I do have to rewatch Die Hard :))\nstudent: How about when this Cambridge experiment's over and you have more free time, I'll take some extra lessons in Skype to practise speaking and writing?\nstudent: Meanwhile, we can continue with the test part of the exam?\nteacher: Ok sure, we can do that! Even though writing is actually perfect for this format, I do it with other students\nteacher: Would you like a writing homework for the Xmas holiday? (I'm so good at Xmas presents!)\nstudent: Oh. Only speaking then, right.\nstudent: I would!\nteacher: Yes, C2 writing is tough and it pays to start early!\nteacher: The main reason it's tough is the time limit: 1 h 30 min to write two essays\nstudent: I think for me speaking and writing will be tough\nstudent: Really? 90 minutes?\nstudent: It is scary\nteacher: Well, you're fluent, so not too tough, but at C2 level you obviously aim to impress, not just speak and write\nstudent: That's the problem ))\nteacher: Yes, and each essay should be 280-320 words\nstudent: Anyway, what would you like me to write about?\nstudent: OMG\nstudent: Maybe taking this exam is not such a good idea after all)))))\nteacher: Yes, that's another thing to think about in terms of computer-based / paper-based. If you type fast, a computer-based exam could give an advantage\nstudent: I think it's more or less the same speed\nteacher: Well, we can give it a go and practise! You didn't think you'd be good at reading and use of English, remember?\nteacher: There are two parts to a writing exam. You have no choice of task in part 1, but in part 2 there are a few options\nteacher: Hold on a sec, I'll email you the paper\nstudent: Yes-yes. I tend to underestimate myself ))\nstudent: OK\nstudent: Thank you\nteacher: There goes, have a quick look please\nstudent: ok\nstudent: opened it\nteacher: Part 1 is a summary task. I would start with Part 2 just this one time\nteacher: Because there's a method to the summary task that we won't have time to discuss today\nstudent: Understood\nstudent: So Task 2 then\nteacher: Could you have a look at Part 2? Which option would you like?\nstudent: Hard to tell\nstudent: all of them are terrible\nteacher: I know!! :))))\nstudent: 4 I guess\nteacher: Well, I suppose the question is, which one would be easiest to write about and work some good language in?\nstudent: The only one I can relate to is number 4\nteacher: I would also go for 4 it was me. Unless I knew lots of good words to describe a building :))\nstudent: or a cartoon book\nstudent: ))))\nstudent: Do I start like\nstudent: Dear ,,,\nteacher: Yes, you can work in lots of emotion vocab, and stuff like 3rd conditionals (what would have happened if you hadn't decided...)\nteacher: and inversions! Little did I know at the time that...\nstudent: A nice tip! thank you!\nteacher: Yes, absolutely, you need a formal letter\nstudent: So starting with 'Dear sir' will be ok?\nteacher: It's kind of a cross between a letter and an essay\nteacher: Dear Sir or Madam,\nstudent: OK\nstudent: Got it\nstudent: I'll try\nstudent: I'll send it to your email\nstudent: email\nteacher: I have decided to take part in ... I have seen the invitation to share... in your magazine\nteacher: Something like that, to start with\nstudent: Thank you!\nteacher: You can do it! :))\nstudent: Have a great holiday!\nstudent: I'll do my best\nteacher: Thank you! You too, have a lovely time with your family!\nstudent: Thank you! Bye!\nteacher: I'll talk to you in the new year! (we can obviously keep in touch on Messenger in the meantime)\nteacher: Bye Sophia Miller :)\nstudent: Sure! See you in 2021\nstudent: wow\nstudent: Bye)",
    "student: Hi, Ms. Patel!\nteacher: Hello-hello!\nteacher: :)\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: Not at first, but I've managed to write my name )\nstudent: I'm fine, thank you!\nteacher: Oh goodness, it took me a few tries too as you can see!\nstudent: )))\nteacher: Have you done your yoga this morning?\nstudent: Yes! )\nteacher: Oh good! So have I!\nstudent: Pilates!\nteacher: Ah, pilates, sure\nstudent: I like pilates more to be honest )\nteacher: Yes, you mentioned that!\nstudent: I don't like the timed (?) breathing in yoga\nstudent: And the speed\nteacher: Is yoga too slow for you?\nstudent: Pilates is faster )\nteacher: Fair enough!\nstudent: Yes! Pilates is not very fast either, but it's still faster than yoga\nteacher: I see, sure!\nstudent: *pilates\nteacher: How are you students? I suppose many of them are going to be on holiday next week?\nstudent: Actually I have a very important mission today )\nstudent: From 8 pm the Oysho shop has a Christmas sale\nstudent: So I have to buy a pair of new leggings for pilates )))\nstudent: And one more t-shirt for my sport )\nteacher: Ooh, it's 'ready steady go' at 8 pm!\nstudent: And as I have a very popular small size I have to be fast )))))\nstudent: *a very popular size\nteacher: I see! Wow, sounds like fun!\nstudent: hahaha )\nstudent: Ethan told me that it sounds weird )\nteacher: I've got an important mission too! The local Tesco is supposed to release more Xmas food delivery slots, and I've got to book at least one!\nstudent: Oh! What are you going to order?\nteacher: Well, like yourself, we get our groceries delivered from a supermarket\nteacher: But It's hard to book delivery slots over a festive period + coronavirus (everyone wants to shop online) + Brexit (people are worried about food supplies)\nteacher: So delivery slots sell like hot cakes!\nstudent: I mean are you going to order something special for Christmas dinner?\nteacher: Oh, yes, I'm going to tell you in  a moment\nteacher: to sell like hot cakes' is a good expression to say that something sells really fast\nteacher: Sportswear in your size will sell like hot cakes tonight!\nstudent: I know you've got two beautiful stollens already )\nstudent: We have the same in Russian )\nstudent: ak goryachie piroshki )\nstudent: *kak\nteacher: We are going to get some mince pies (we need to some for Santa). Michael Smith's making a beef pie called a cobbler, so we'll need the ingredients for that + Brussel sprouts, carrots (for the reindeer), nice vegetables\nteacher: Aaah, I've forgotten about that expression! Yes, like hot cakes!\nteacher: Yes, my stollens are ripening :) So we\nteacher: we're sorted for cake\nstudent: to be sorted\nstudent: ?\nteacher: *sorry, we need some for Santa\nteacher: Oh,\nteacher: sorry, trying to type fast!\nteacher: sorted' means this is not a problem anymore\nstudent: No worries!\nstudent: Ah! Sure!\nstudent: Thank you\nstudent: Ok\nstudent: I have one more question in the food area ))\nteacher: It comes from the phrase 'sort something out'\nteacher: Go on!\nstudent: Do you eat cereals for breakfast usually?\nstudent: As her majesty does )\nstudent: We don't usually, but I would like Sophia to try it\nstudent: Because you know Peppa usually has some cereals for breakfast )\nteacher: Haha, good question! We are boring with our breakfasts, actually. We eat a bowl of porridge and a toast with some peanut butter on each 6 days a week, and I make pancakes or waffles once a week (sometimes with bacon and maple syrup)\nteacher: But I would say lots of people here eat cornflakes / muesli / granola for breakfast\nteacher: or rice crispies - things like that\nteacher: But the trouble with them is that they are full of sugar!\nteacher: I like my sugar in a cake or chocolate, not for breakfast!\nstudent: I would like to buy cornflakes for her. I think it's Peppa's favourite food for breakfast )\nstudent: Ah! Ok\nstudent: I don't like extra sugar either\nstudent: Usually we eat porridge or eggs (Sophia doesn't like eggs) or syrnitki )\nteacher: Here you can find some cornflakes without added sugar, but you've got to go to a posh supermarket like Waitrose :)\nstudent: *syrniki )\nteacher: I tried to get Emma into syrniki! He liked them at first but then changed his mind :(\nstudent: Ah, avocado and hummus as well\nteacher: And he doesn't like eggs either\u00ac\nteacher: Ooh, super nice!\nteacher: And hipster :)))\nstudent: ahaha\nstudent: I'm just bored of porridge\nstudent: I like it but not every day\nteacher: bored with / of\nteacher: bored of porridge :)\nstudent: Ok so I'm bored with porridge )\nstudent: not with? (\nteacher: Sure! I'm kind of bored of it too, but in the morning, when it's still dark and we're all sleepy, we just automatically put the porridge on, pop some bread into a toaster and make coffee\nteacher: No decision-making :)\nteacher: Like Obama and his suits)\nteacher: Bored with is fine!\nstudent: )))) I've never heard about it!\nteacher: about Obama?\nstudent: What's wrong with his suits?\nteacher: Oh, if I remember correctly, when he was the president, he used to have 7 identical suits for every day of the week\nteacher: Then they were all dry-cleaned, and he could start again on Monday :))\nstudent: haha\nteacher: So that he didn't have to spend time and energy thinking what to wear\nstudent: It's a nice decision )\nteacher: Yes, definitely! I think it's what stylists are starting to recommend now, isn't it. The capsule wardrobe or something like that\nteacher: Do you know what I'm trying to say?\nstudent: Sure!\nstudent: I know\nstudent: all pieces of the wardrobe have to match each other\nstudent: So you don't need a lot\nteacher: Yes, or the capsule wardrobe of 2020. A nice top + pj bottoms\nstudent: sure )))))\nteacher: Do you try to follow this principle?\nstudent: Or just underwear and a nice top )\nteacher: that's it :))\nteacher: the Zoom mermaid )))\nstudent: No. I like shopping and I like to be different )\nstudent: But what I do is I try to buy fewer clothes\nstudent: And I try to buy something of higher quality\nteacher: I like dresses because you don't have to think about matching the top and the bottom\nteacher: Oh, I agree! So that it lasts\nstudent: I used to like dresses\nstudent: But now because of a child\nteacher: If I ___ a busy office job (have), maybe I ___ ____ a capsule wardrobe (build)\nstudent: I try to wear something more comfortable to move\nteacher: Oh definitely, I know what you mean! I cycle a lot, so it needs to be good for cycling\nteacher: Could you fill in the gaps, please?\nstudent: If I had a busy office job (have), maybe I would bought a capsule wardrobe\nstudent: Sorry\nstudent: I would buy\nstudent: Or would build\nteacher: Yes! perfect :)\nteacher: As I think you heard in the song I sang you, the if- part doesn't have to go at the beginning of course\nstudent: thanks )\nteacher: But I could if I wanted to :)\nteacher: Sorry, I sent you not I sang you!!!\nteacher: Luckily for you, I didn't sing it to you!\nstudent: )))\nteacher: Ok, let's practise a bit with the 2nd conditional and imaginary situations!\nstudent: Why luckily? )\nteacher: Well, because I don't sing very well, and you wouldn't be very lucky if I sang for you :)\nstudent: Don't be so shy )))\nteacher: I'm not shy, I'm realistic :)))\nteacher: Ok, imaginary situations!\nstudent: Ok, let's practise )\nstudent: sorry\nstudent: practise\nteacher: If money / work / visas / houses / family weren't a factor and you could live in any country in the world, where would you want to live?\nteacher: I don't mean 'if you didn't have your family', just, if you could all move, I suppose :)\nstudent: Oh\nstudent: If money weren't a factor I would go to London )\nstudent: I like the city so much\nstudent: I mean the city center )\nteacher: Oh really? Interesting! I thought you would say Italy!\nstudent: Hm\nteacher: Yes, London is pretty amazing!\nstudent: Italy\nstudent: I think it's better to live in London and to have holidays in Italy )\nteacher: Makes sense! Many people would agree with you :)\nstudent: Italy is more about holidays though\nteacher: Sure\nteacher: Ok, what would you do if you won a lottery?\nstudent: Gelato italiano... mmm )\nteacher: Oh yes, so good! in Greece, too\nstudent: Ok! If I won a lottery I would move to London )))\nstudent: haha\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: :)))) and what would you do?\nstudent: If I won a huge sum of money, I would move to London and\nstudent: I would buy some agribusiness for Ethan\nteacher: agribusiness? like agricultural?\nstudent: And the rest of the money I would give to charity\nstudent: Yes! Like that\nteacher: I didn't know he was into agriculture!\nteacher: Like a farm?\nstudent: He dreams about such a business\nteacher: Ooh, interesting!\nstudent: more like fields\nstudent: With some agriculture\nteacher: Interesting!\nteacher: Well, it's a popular business in the UK, so you could!\nstudent: I think it's quite boring ) But he wants it )\nteacher: What would he do with it? If he had a business like this?\nstudent: Oh no, we would buy it in Ukraine\nteacher: Fair enough! Ukraine is a good place for it!\nstudent: )\nstudent: He didn't have a business like this\nstudent: But he's worked as a lawyer in such a company\nstudent: And he has a friend whose family does it\nstudent: he has\nstudent: whose family?\nteacher: Correct, whose family!\nstudent: Ah! Sure!\nstudent: And he dreams about that car\nstudent: you know\nteacher: a tractor??\nstudent: like the one people use in Texas ))\nstudent: *in Texas\nteacher: Hmm\nteacher: like a Range Rover here?\nteacher: Or like a pick-up truck?\nstudent: a pick-up truck\nteacher: Got you :)\nstudent: Yes!!!\nteacher: Do you think you would ever enjoy life in the countryside if Ethan bought a business like this?\nstudent: I'm not sure I would like to be a farmer's wife ))))\nteacher: No, I can't see you in this role, to be honest :))\nstudent: me neither\nteacher: Ok, if you could have any job you wanted, what would you do?\nstudent: But people here in Ukraine still live in Kyiv for example and have some fields in other areas\nstudent: Ok. To be honest I've been thinking about it for a long time\nteacher: Oh interesting, I didn't know that! I think in the UK, if you own a farm, you live there and it's your lifestyle\nstudent: And I still don't have an answer\nstudent: But\nstudent: For my grammar.. ok!\nteacher: Yes, for grammar and for fun!\nstudent: If I could have any job, I would be a charity someone )\nteacher: Oh, you would work for a charity?\nstudent: yes, I would work for a charity\nteacher: Sure, sounds lovely!\nstudent: But actually I'm not sure that I'm prepared mentally for it )\nteacher: I would be a neuroscientist or a therapist or a doctor\nteacher: But most probably a neuroscientist! It's such an exciting area of knowledge!\nteacher: I know what you mean! Especially in Ukraine, it's hard emotional work!\nstudent: a neuroscientist! wow!\nstudent: I wouldn't like to be a doctor\nteacher: Yes, get inside people's brains :)\nstudent: it's so hard\nteacher: I completely agree! But it's fun to dream about what things would be if ...!\nstudent: I think I wouldn't be able to think about their pain\nteacher: Yes, especially this year!\nstudent: But actually not just this )\nteacher: But my grandmother was a doctor and my mum is a pharmacist, so it's kind of always been in the air, as an option\nstudent: Oh! It's amazing! Your grandmother was a doctor!\nteacher: Yes! She was a very interesting person!\nstudent: Nice!\nteacher: Anyway, I've got to let you go! Thanks for today, speak to you on Friday!\nstudent: Thank you!!!\nstudent: Have a good afternoon\nteacher: My pleasure :)\nstudent: See you!\nstudent: Bye!",
    "student: Hi, Mrs. Parker )\nteacher: Hiya!\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: my Ukrainian name today ))\nstudent: Fine, thank you )\nteacher: I thought you decided it was easier to spell in this chatroom))\nstudent: Have had yoga today\nstudent: In my old leggings ))\nteacher: Nice! Not pilates?\nstudent: Today yoga )\nteacher: Oh no, that was a disappointment about that sale, wasn't it?\nstudent: Usually we have pilates on Wednesdays and yoga on Fridays\nstudent: Yes, I'm completely disappointed\nteacher: I see, so you always fit in a workout before your English class :)\nteacher: Yes, I can imagine!\nstudent: They don't have my size in their online store\nteacher: Did it sell out?\nstudent: But they have it at their store in Gulliver mall\nstudent: But I don't want to run around Kiev between their different stores! )\nteacher: and you shouldn't have to!\nstudent: yes )) a strange system )\nteacher: Yes, if a shop has sold all of the product, they sell out\nteacher: You probably know this one from online shopping\nteacher: they always right 'sold out'\nstudent: yes (\nteacher: And if there are no more tables at a restaurant / rooms at a hotel, we say that they are 'fully ____'\nteacher: do you know this one?\nstudent: no\nteacher: fully booked\nstudent: ah\nstudent: sure\nstudent: )\nteacher: so you can't make a booking\nteacher: fully booked and sold out - both very disappointing!\nstudent: agree )\nteacher: how's it going with the LOL advent calendar?\nstudent: What about your Christmas presents?\nteacher: I'm sorted, thank you :)\nstudent: Ah! The LOL Advent calendar is amazing ) Sophia is happy every morning )\nstudent: Now we have:\nstudent: One doll, several pairs of trousers and some tops\nstudent: a bikini\nstudent: a pair of sunglasses\nstudent: One dress\nteacher: wonderful!\nstudent: and something like a hat\nstudent: but it looks like headphones\nstudent: Actually, I like it too\nteacher: oh yes, I know what you mean!\nstudent: Lily as \"Lili\". can play with all this stuff later\nstudent: Sophia\nstudent: Sorry 0\nstudent: not Lily as \"Lili\". )))))\nstudent: but what I really don't like is that all these things are too small\nteacher: haha)) good typo\nstudent: All the time she loses something and we have to find it)\nteacher: oh, are they about the size of Lego minifigures?\nstudent: these things\nteacher: yes, good correction!\nstudent: The doll is about 8-10 cm I think\nstudent: But you can imagine its boots for example\nteacher: ah, yes, tiny!\nstudent: Actually now we have two pairs of boots )))))\nstudent: I missed them )\nteacher: Nice!\nstudent: all the time I have to find something ))\nteacher: Yes, I can imagine they are so easy to lose!\nteacher: Oh, I wanted to tell you\nteacher: You know how a stollen needs to ripen\nstudent: Yes! But it's just a mother's fate )))\nstudent: it's\nstudent: no!\nteacher: to ripen = to start to taste better over time\nteacher: for example, fruit need to ripen\nteacher: ripen = verb; ripe = adjective\nstudent: I know the word ))\nteacher: Ah, sorry!\nstudent: no no\nstudent: I just want to 'hvastatsya'\nstudent: ))\nteacher: brag!\nteacher: go on!\nstudent: Yes! I like to brag ))\nteacher: or 'show off', probably better here\nstudent: ok! I need to show off )\nstudent: Ok! And what about the stollens?\nteacher: Well, thinking about it, people would probably say 'I'd just like to share with you' in English\nstudent: hm\nstudent: ok )\nteacher: because 'brag' and 'show off' are both quite negative\nstudent: I'd just like to share with you ))\nteacher: Go on))\nstudent: So I know the word 'ripe' )\nstudent: *the word\nstudent: *a word?\nteacher: Ah, I'm with you now, thanks!\nteacher: yes, the word\nteacher: ripe / unripe\nteacher: How do you prefer your bananas? Ripe or unripe?\nstudent: I think unripe\nteacher: Me too!\nteacher: I hate very ripe bananas!\nteacher: so the verb is 'ripen'\nstudent: But if I have some ripe ones, I prefer to cook banana bread )\nteacher: For example, supermarkets sell 'ripen at home' fruit\nteacher: You buy it unripe and it's supposed to get better over time\nstudent: so ripen is the form of the verb ripe?\nstudent: or no?\nteacher: Yes, that's right! to ripen = to become ripe\nteacher: At the moment my stollen is ripening\nteacher: But I wanted to tell you that an English Christmas pudding is supposed to ripen too!\nteacher: In fact, it's supposed to be made in July and ripened for 5-6 months\nstudent: Oh! I've heard about it\nteacher: You've heard about it?\nstudent: it's so difficult I think\nteacher: hear - heard - heard, with a 'd'\nstudent: heard sorry )\nteacher: Because they soak all the fruit in brandy\nteacher: And the alcohol preserves it\nstudent: soak\nstudent: ?\nteacher: Yes, if you put dried fruit in brandy, for example, you soak it\nstudent: Ok! I see!\nteacher: Or in water - in something liquid\nteacher: I forgot my umbrella and was soaking wet!\nteacher: soaking wet = an expression, doesn't make much sense grammatically to me\nstudent: soaking wet - it's strange in Russian or Ukrainian )\nstudent: to me too ))\nteacher: or English))\nstudent: haha\nteacher: I suppose it's like 'boiling hot' or 'freezing cold'\nteacher: Yes, in fact\nteacher: boiling hot, freezing cold, soaking wet\nstudent: haha, yes!\nstudent: boiling hot is the real expression\nstudent: as well as freezing cold\nteacher: yes, they are all real expressions!\nstudent: oh no ))\nteacher: boiling hot, freezing cold = about the weather\nteacher: soaking wet = usually the result of the weather. My dog was soaking wet, I was soaking wet etc.\nteacher: my coat was soaking wet\nstudent: where is my facepalm emoji )\nteacher: :))) yes, it's hard here without emojis!\nteacher: Yes, so, back to Christmas pudding, there's so much alcohol in it that you should be able to light it\nteacher: Remember in the article about what the Queen eats?\nstudent: What do you mean? The Christmas pudding?\nteacher: When it's served, people set it on fire, basically\nteacher: Because of all the alcohol in it, it catches fire\nstudent: Ah! Yes!!\nteacher: But we don't like Christmas pudding, actually. It's not my idea of a cake\nstudent: Actually I've tried one homemade Christmas pudding\nstudent: When I was at Jennifer's  parents' home for Christmas\nteacher: Oh you have? Did you like it?\nstudent: Not much I think\nstudent: It's too wet for me\nteacher: Yes, it's weird. English people call it 'rich'\nteacher: Like, the flavours are rich (very strong). Too rich for some people!\nstudent: and too nasyshenniy )\nteacher: rich!!\nteacher: exactly\nstudent: Yes! Too rich\nteacher: :)\nstudent: I like something poorer ))\nstudent: haha\nteacher: Haha, yes! I suppose if we're talking about cakes, the opposite of 'rich' is 'delicate'\nstudent: But it's interesting\nteacher: Christmas pudding is definitely not delicate\nstudent: Maybe you've noticed that British people like to plan everything more than we here in Ukraine\nteacher: Oh goodness, yes! Everything is prepared in advance!\nteacher: I've adopted this habit, actually\nstudent: And we can see that they even make their Christmas pudding half a year before )\nteacher: I used to procrastinate a lot in my youth :)\nstudent: I like to plan\nteacher: Were you like this when you were younger as well? Oh have you always been very organized?\nstudent: But when I compare myself with someone Brithish I feel like I don't plan anything )\nstudent: I've been pretty organized all my life\nteacher: You were organized in the past and you're still organized! You ___ always ___ organized\nstudent: But now actually I don't think that it's a good habit if you try to plan everything\nstudent: I've always been ))\nstudent: Yes!\nstudent: )))\nteacher: Yes, correct!))\nteacher: Well, not all British people are organized! But generally speaking, yes, more so than in Ukraine\nstudent: You feel stressed when something goes wrong if you had a plan before\nteacher: Why isn't it a good idea to plan?\nteacher: Yes, I see!\nteacher: It's important to be flexible\nstudent: Yes\nstudent: I try to do it\nstudent: It's quite difficult for me because I like plan ))\nteacher: Haha, I know what you mean!\nstudent: I even like to plan what other people have to do ))))))\nteacher: Well, I suppose it's an important skill for a someone who runs their own business!\nstudent: Oh, I'm not sure now\nteacher: Do you know 'to run a business'?\nstudent: Actually now it's more trendy and important to be flexible\nstudent: according to some business guru )\nstudent: to run a business like to start it\nteacher: Not exactly, actually. You start a business and then you run it :)\nstudent: Ah ok )\nteacher: So you and Isabel are running a language school\nstudent: Yes ) We do )\nteacher: Actually, not all business owners run their businesses. They sometimes hire directors to run them for them\nteacher: But you own the school and run it :)\nstudent: I think it's a good idea\nstudent: I'm quite tired of it actually\nteacher: To hire someone else to do it? or to run it yourself?\nteacher: Oh really?\nstudent: To hire someone\nteacher: Well, you did say that you can't even relax when you're on holiday!\nstudent: Yes, I mean that the income is not as high as I wanted )\nstudent: And maybe I need to start something else )\nteacher: Oh that's a shame! Is that because of covid?\nstudent: Actually it's not so hard\nstudent: I don't have to work during the working days for example\nteacher: Oh that's good, so you get a break\nstudent: About the income. I mean It's just usual for this area of activity\nstudent: We don't have lots of clients and it's logical\nteacher: I see. It's a language school not an oil business!\nstudent: And even more\nstudent: It's not an English or German or French language school\nstudent: You know not many people are ready to start learning Russian or Ukrainian\nteacher: Ah, I see! I always thought it was an interesting niche\nstudent: Yes, it's interesting, but it's a niche )\nteacher: Exactly! I think I know what you mean!\nstudent: We have an adjective in Russian 'nisheviy'\nteacher: niche' can be an adjective!\nstudent: I see!\nteacher: you used it correctly, it's niche\nteacher: it's pronounced the French way, with a /sh/\nstudent: Ok, so now I'm not too happy with my job\nstudent: I need something new\nteacher: /ni\u02d0\u0283/\nteacher: long i:\nstudent: Ah! Ok! Thank you )\nteacher: Oh I see! Well, I suppose it was good to have something familiar while Sophia was really small. Maybe you're ready for an adventure now!\nteacher: What about Isabel? Do you think she's happy to continue?\nstudent: I feel like I'm having an English lesson plus a therapy session now )))\nstudent: It looks like I'm complaining\nstudent: )))\nteacher: No, you're not complaining! You're sharing your thoughts)) I like to hear your thoughts!\nstudent: I think Isabel isn't too happy either\nstudent: We've already discussed it\nstudent: But now it's quite difficult to change something\nstudent: because of the Covid situation as usual now )\nteacher: I see! Well, sounds like you're on the same page\nteacher: Yep, everything is 'because of Covid' this year :(\nstudent: Yes! We are on the same page ))\nteacher: Yes, it's a good expression :)\nstudent: I like it )\nteacher: very easy to guess what it means))\nstudent: It's more logical than soaking wet ))\nteacher: Haha, definitely!\nteacher: Are you thinking about selling the business potentially?\nstudent: Maybe but we are not sure 100%\nteacher: We ___ sell the business\nteacher: give me a nice modal verb, please))\nstudent: It would be better just to find someone who will care about it )\nteacher: Yes, you could hire someone to ___ it\nstudent: we would sell you mean?\nteacher: what if you're not sure? maybe yes maybe no?\nstudent: you could hire someone to run it\nstudent: exactly! )\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: might / could / may all work here!\nteacher: we might sell it etc.\nstudent: Ok! THank you!\nteacher: Ok, time to let you go! I've just seen your message, you remember that we won't have more chats until January. I'll be back at work on January 4, but you just let me know which days you can do then. We'll keep in touch!\nstudent: Ok! Thank you!\nstudent: See you!\nteacher: Lovely! Enjoy your holiday!\nstudent: I wish you a merry Christmas ))))\nteacher: Thank you very much :))))\nstudent: you too! Thank you!\nteacher: You too!",
    "student: hi, I will be a bit late today, is that okay?\nteacher: Hi Sophia! Do you need more time?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Ok, sure, how long do you need?\nstudent: I am still not at home\nstudent: I think 15 minutes\nstudent: maybe less\nteacher: ok, no worries\nteacher: travel safe\nstudent: hi\nteacher: Hi Sophia!\nteacher: All ok with you?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Did you get a detention? :))\nstudent: no\nstudent: traffic\nstudent: jams\nstudent: in Kyiv )\nteacher: Ah, I see :)\nteacher: do you know\nteacher: a detention'?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: ok)) Harry Potter got a lot of them, but I'm sure you don't :)\nstudent: we don't have detentions in my school\nteacher: That's good! I hope you haven't got Dolores Umbridge :)\nstudent: NO\nteacher: :))\nteacher: Ok, I'm going to be on holiday starting from next week and until January 4, so there will be no chats until then!\nteacher: But I do understand that the beginning of January is when your holiday is!\nteacher: So you just let me know whether you can make it that week, ok?\nstudent: I think I would be able to do that\nteacher: Ok, I'll pencil our class in for Tuesday 5 January, but I'll text you before that\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Have you got big plans for your holiday?\nstudent: no\nteacher: Any plans at all? What are you looking forward to?\nstudent: maybe I wanna see my friends\nteacher: Oh yes, I remember, you mentioned that!\nteacher: I'm looking forward to Christmas! Do you know much about Christmas traditions? In the UK / US etc.?\nstudent: Hm\nstudent: maybe some of them\nteacher: Well, people decorate Christmas trees, eat chocolate from advent calendars and swap presents\nteacher: Do you know maybe any Xmas movies? or stories? or songs?\nstudent: Home Alone\nteacher: definitely!\nteacher: anything else?\nstudent: Harry Potter also has Xmas themes)\nstudent: The Grinch\nteacher: Yes, absolutely!\nteacher: If you were Harry, would you prefer Christmas at Hogwarts or in the Burrow?\nstudent: the Burrow\nteacher: you know what I'm going to say. Why?\nstudent: because the Weasleys became his family\nstudent: so I think it would be better to go home with Ron\nteacher: Ah, it's better to spend Christmas with your family?\nteacher: Yes, I agree!\nteacher: Ok, Christmas songs!\nteacher: Do you know any?\nstudent: I don't really think so\nteacher: Well, there are two kinds of Christmas songs. There are pop songs that you can hear at shopping malls, for example\nteacher: Like 'Let it snow', 'All I want for Christmas', 'Last Christmas I gave you my heart'\nteacher: Usually about love :)\nstudent: yes\nstudent: I know them\nteacher: But there are also songs about the Christmas story, about how Jesus was born\nteacher: They are sung in churches and in schools in the UK\nteacher: For example, my son's favourite that he learned at school is 'Away in the manger'\nteacher: a manger is a box from which horses and cows feed\nteacher: Jesus was born in a manger\nteacher: It's a really nice song! These church Christmas songs are called 'carols'\nstudent: yeah\nteacher: /\u02c8k\u00e6r.\u0259l/\nstudent: can I ask you?\nteacher: Yes of course!\nstudent: Does your son speak Russian ?)\nteacher: Very little Russian, unfortunately! His Dad is English, so we mostly speak English at home. I do try to teach him some Russian and he's even doing a Russian class online once a week now\nteacher: But I don't know if he'll ever speak good Russian / Ukrainian! I guess it also depends on whether he would like to when he grows up\nstudent: Maybe he can speak Russian with your parents\nteacher: Yes, he does a bit sometimes! over skype\nstudent: it is nice to know a lot of languages\nteacher: definitely!\nteacher: Are there any Christmas carold in Ukraine?\nteacher: *sorry, carols\nstudent: kolyadki\nteacher: Correct!\nteacher: Kolyadki are the Ukrainian equivalent\nteacher: And do you know that one Ukrainian kolyadka has become popular all over the world as a Christmas carol?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Yes, of course you do!\nstudent: chervona ruta?)\nteacher: Which one?\nteacher: Nooo! it's not a kolyadka!\nstudent: oy no\nstudent: not the correct name\nstudent: I forgot the name but I understand what you are talking about\nstudent: and Americans say that this song is American\nteacher: It's called Carol of the Bells here. I've just sent you a video about it. Could you watch and let me know what it's called in Ukrainian?\nstudent: but it is a lie\nteacher: No, it's not American, you're right!\nstudent: Shchedryk!!!\nteacher: Yes!!\nteacher: Have you listened to the whole story?\nstudent: I still remember the lyrics\nteacher: Yes)) it's beautiful\nstudent: no\nteacher: Ok, can you listen to the whole story, please?\nteacher: I mean watch\nstudent: I am here\nteacher: Great! How did you like the story?\nstudent: I remember it from my music lesson)\nteacher: Yes, I bet you do!\nteacher: I had no idea that Leontovych was assassinated by a Soviet agent!\nstudent: me neither\nteacher: Do you think the lady who presents the video is English / American / Ukrainian?\nstudent: Ukrainian\nteacher: you know what I'm going to say Sophia :)\nstudent: because she looks like she is Ukrainian\nstudent: her speaking is not clearly English or American\nstudent: and the name of the channel\nstudent: with the word KIEV\nteacher: it's Kyivpost, but anyone could work for it, right?\nteacher: Her accent is American, actually\nstudent: yes\nteacher: what do you mean by she looks Ukrainian?\nstudent: like Slavic\nstudent: slavyani\nteacher: Ok, I see what you mean :)\nteacher: I agree with you, actually, I think she's Ukrainian because she pronounces Ukrainian names like a native speaker\nteacher: But her English is brilliant!\nteacher: Slavic\nstudent: yes\nteacher: I'll send you another version of the Carol of the Bells, sung acapella\nteacher: do you know 'acapella'?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Sorry, wrong spelling!\nteacher: a cappella\nteacher: double pp double ll\nteacher: what does it mean?\nstudent: like there is no music\nstudent: and music is made from the sounds that people make\nteacher: yes, exactly!\nteacher: Like many music words, it comes from ... which language?\nstudent: Italian\nteacher: absolutely, correct!\nteacher: Ok, Sophia, I'll let you go. Have a wonderful Christmas and a happy New Year! I'll talk to you on Tuesday January 5 at the usual time (unless you're busy, then you'll let me know)\nstudent: You too!!\nstudent: bye  bye!\nteacher: Bye Sophia :)",
    "student: Hello, Mr. Johnson.\nteacher: Hi Emily Smith!\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: Long time no see.\nstudent: I'm fine.\nteacher: Yes, it's been a while. Good to speak to you again!\nstudent: Good to speak to you too!\nteacher: Did you celebrate New Year? Or is it not a celebration in China and you're waiting for Chinese New Year to celebrate?\nstudent: Yes. We didn't celebrate the New Year, but we had a 3-day holiday.\nstudent: In China, we just celebrate the Chinese New Year.\nteacher: Ok, I see, it makes sense! Did you have a nice break over the New Year in this case?\nstudent: I didn't go out because the holiday was not long.\nteacher: Oh, it wasn't long enough, I see!\nstudent: But I went to the gym.\nteacher: We had a long holiday, but we didn't go out because we are under yet another lockdown. The virus situation is really bad in the UK at the moment!\nstudent: Sorry to hear that.\nteacher: Thank you. We deserve it for not acting as efficiently and responsibly as you did in China!\nstudent: Hope the pandemic will go away soon.\nteacher: Yes, me too! The UK now has two vaccines, they are trying to vaccinate as fast as possible\nstudent: Yes. I hear that the vaccines are more efficient\nstudent: .\nteacher: How's your book going? Have you been reading more in English?\nstudent: Yes. I'm still reading the book.\nteacher: Ok, are you enjoying it? Which bit are you reading about at the moment?\nstudent: Yes. But I can't remember the names from it.\nstudent: They're having a match.\nteacher: Oh, a quidditch match? where they fly on brooms?\nstudent: Yes!\nteacher: Ah, exciting!\nteacher: Ok, I thought we could practise a bit of vocabulary using some ideas from Harry Potter. In particular, personality adjectives (the adjectives that describe what kind of person someone is)\nteacher: You know how the Sorting Hat puts students into four different houses at Hogwarts?\nteacher: Can you remember what kind of students get into Gryffindor, Harry Potter's house?\nstudent: Yes. I remenber that.\nteacher: Ok, so what kind of person does one need to be to get into Gryffindor?\nstudent: Sorry. Is it brave?\nteacher: Yes, that's what I am looking for!\nteacher: brave is a good adjective, or another one is 'courageous'\nteacher: brave' and 'courageous' are synonyms\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: Do you know the noun for 'courageous'? The quality of being courageous\nteacher: #ERROR!\nstudent: courage?\nteacher: ah, nearly\nteacher: courage\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: an uncountable noun\nteacher: Ok, so students who get sorted into Gryffindor are brave / courageous, well done!\nteacher: What about Ravenclaw? if you remember\nstudent: clever?\nteacher: Yes, correct!\nteacher: Do you know any synonyms for 'clever'?\nteacher: clever = ?\nstudent: intellegent?\nteacher: yes, well done!\nteacher: There's also 'bright' in British English and 'smart' in American English\nteacher: e.g. she is a very bright student!\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: Ok, well done!\nteacher: What about Slytherin?\nstudent: Sorry. I can't remember.\nteacher: no worries, Slytherin students are supposed to have big career goals\nteacher: they are ambitious\nstudent: But maybe honest?\nstudent: Oh,yes\nteacher: Ah, I think you're thinking about Hufflepuff where everyone is honest and nice\nteacher: Slytherin is the house of Draco Malfoy, ambitious and sometimes actually dishonest\nstudent: Yes.\nteacher: If a person is clever and can get what they want in a dishonest way, we can call them 'cunning'\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: In European fairy tales, a fox is often cunning. Clever and dishonest. Is there an animal in Chinese stories that is associated with being cunning?\nstudent: I think in China also it's a fox.\nstudent: In China\nteacher: Ok, fair enough! A fox it is!\nteacher: I think it's because foxes are so clever and they can steal chickens from farms, so farmers think they are cunning\nstudent: Yes. In Chinese history books, there are a lot of stories about foxes.\nteacher: Would you say 'ambitious' is a positive or negative quality?\nteacher: Ah, interesting! I didn't know that!\nstudent: I think ambitious is a negative quality in this case.\nteacher: I see what you mean, maybe in the context of Slytherin. But generally in English 'ambitious' is positive, actually\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: If a person is ambitious, they want to achieve goals in life, maybe in their career\nteacher: And they are comfortable with becoming leaders, for example\nstudent: So it's a good word to describe people.\nteacher: Yes, I would say so!\nteacher: The noun is 'ambition', what you want to achieve\nteacher: For example, it's your ambition to become a PhD student at Fudan University, isn't it?\nstudent: Yes! It's my ambition.\nteacher: Yes! So you're an ambitious person :)\nteacher: Ok, we've got one last house left. Hufflepuff students tend to be honest as you said and also...??\nstudent: Is there a word to describe the negative meaning of ambition in English?\nteacher: Good question, let me have a think!\nstudent: I'm not sure, but in China I think ambition is to describe good goals, someone who is ambitious may have a negative quality.\nstudent: And Hufflepuff students tend to be honest and loyal, I think.\nteacher: I see! I meant 'ambitious' in a very positive way when I said you were ambitious\nstudent: Yes.\nteacher: I think 'ambitious' can be positive or negative depending on a situation\nstudent: Yes.\nteacher: For example, schools try to support girls to be more ambitious\nteacher: #ERROR!\nteacher: You can also desribe an ambitious person as 'an achiever'. Someone for whom achievement is very important\nteacher: it can sometimes be an unpleasant quality!\nstudent: Yes. In China there are words to describe people as positively ambitious or negatively ambitious.\nstudent: But when I translate them into English, they are both the same word 'ambitious'.\nteacher: Oh, I know! Someone who is ambitious in a negative way is 'vain'\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: Someone who seeks status, likes to talk about themselves all the time, likes to be praised\nteacher: is vain\nteacher: Someone who places to much importance on their achievements or appearance, actually\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: an example from the dictionary: He was very vain about his hair and clothes\nteacher: *sorry, too much importance\nstudent: So vain is an always negative word.\nteacher: Yes, that's right! Vain is always negative, and ambitious is quite positive\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: Ok, back to Hufflepuff! Loyalty is a noun, the adjective is...? you need to lose two letters\nstudent: loyal\nteacher: Yes, cool!\nteacher: And they are also supposed to be kind-hearted\nteacher: and patient\nteacher: and the opposite of vain = humble\nstudent: So they are all nice people in Hufflepuff.\nteacher: If a person is humble, they don't like to talk about their success or achievements\nteacher: Yes, they are basically nice people in Hufflepuff, yes :)\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: Which house do you think you would be sorted into? :) and I'll tell you mine\nstudent: I think I should be in Hufflepuff. But I'd like to be in Gryffindor.\nteacher: Oh, that's very nice! I'd love to be in Gryffindor too, but the Pottermore quiz sorted me into Ravenclaw. I'll send you a link to the quiz if you'd like, it's fun!\nteacher: Do you think courage is important then?\nstudent: Yes. I want the link.\nteacher: Yes, sure, I'll pop it into an email to you\nstudent: And yes, I think courage is important.\nteacher: why?\nstudent: We always want to do something which makes us curious, and in this case, we should have the courage to try.\nteacher: Yes, good point! We need to be courageous to try new things!\nstudent: And people are always afraid of unknown things.\nteacher: Ok, thank you. The new words for today are courageous, courage, bright / smart, humble, kind-hearted, patient, ambitious, an achiever and vain (maybe not all of them are new). If you are learning them, could you make sure you check the pronunciation, please?\nteacher: Yes, I agree with you!\nstudent: OK. I will check the pronunciation.\nteacher: Sorry for keeping you for a few extra minutes, I'll let you go now!\nstudent: check\nteacher: Speak to you on Thursday :)\nstudent: Thanks.\nstudent: OK.",
    "teacher: Hi Samantha!\nstudent: Hi Lisa Thompson! How are you?\nstudent: Finally I am almost on time, even though my network isn't too stable today so I had to restart the modem\nteacher: Hi Samantha! Did you first try to enter as user64778, please?\nteacher: No worries, it's a really chaotic day in the UK today\nstudent: Yes that was me..\nteacher: Oh good, it's not always clear what's going on in this chatroom\nstudent: I don't know why it is still visible.\nteacher: Have you heard that we are under a new lockdown and schools have closed?\nstudent: I didn't hear about that, but I saw the data from the current infections rate in the UK, and it clearly is a very bad situation...\nteacher: Yes, we're the 'plague island'\nstudent: Luckily Brexit ended up with some sort of agreement...I believe the next months will be hard for the UK...unfortunately\nstudent: But probably the variant is already present in Europe, it simply hasn't been detected...Of course I hope to be wrong, but in the US they already found some community spread\nteacher: Well, a lot of this hardship is self-inflicted, starting with Brexit\nstudent: That's also true...anyway, also here in Austria we are under a lockdown which has already been prolonged..\nteacher: Yes, British scientists have really been on the ball in terms of detecting mutations, who knows what's going on in places where there isn't such rigorous monitoring\nteacher: Ok, what are the restrictions in Austria?\nstudent: Non-essential shops are closed, people are invited to work from home (as I have been doing for the last ~6 months), schools are closed, you can't meet with other people...\nstudent: at least they are allowing us to go out for walks.\nteacher: Oh, schools are closed too? I didn't realize that!\nstudent: Indeed, I know that the UK does a lot of genetic testing, I really don't know why other countries aren't doing the same.\nstudent: Yes, but luckily my children go to a...oh, I can't remember the proper name...babysitter at home...who can work.\nstudent: But, at least in our case, we have halved the number of hours that she looks after our children, which makes things a bit complicated at home.\nteacher: Here the irony is that the prime minister said he was confident that schools were 'perfectly safe' and should remain open and then 18 hours later closed them, leaving no time for parents or teachers to prepare\nteacher: a childminder\nstudent: childminder, okay, someone who minds children\nteacher: yes, exactly\nteacher: a Tagesmutter, I learned that one from you. Does it basically mean 'day mother'?\nstudent: Yes, indeed\nteacher: the German language certainly has a way of describing things :)\nstudent: In Italy there is no such profession, so that's how I originally learned about childminders.\nstudent: Indeed, German is usually very effective at describing everything with precision ...\nteacher: Anyway, in practical terms, the new lockdown means that my 5-year-old is at home now, and my husband and I take turns looking after him. My husband has a full-time job and mine is part-time. It's a dance as you can imagine! I will be trying to keep as many classes as possible, but some might have to be cancelled / re-arranged. Taking into account your wife's shifts, I think we'll have to agree on the times on a weekly basis, as we said before\nstudent: I see...the same is happening here, luckily my wife has just begun her part-time job and she works only a few hours per week.\nteacher: Ok, sure. Is she enjoying her new job?\nstudent: Yes, she is quite happy about it: the workplace is beautiful, with friendly collegues, the only problem is that she still has some troubles with the language: many people here speak Styrian, the local dialect\nstudent: which makes them hard to understand for someone with a B2 level of standard German\nteacher: Oh I see! I hope it'll get easier for her soon. Dialects are so tricky, there are some places in the UK where I wouldn't understand very much either\nteacher: I've been on the lookout for some interesting expressions in the news that I could bring into our lessons.\nstudent: Haha...indeed! But I believe she is getting better by the day...the real problem is that, as a nurse, communication is very important and she sometimes feels like she can't take care of the patients as much as she would have liked.\nteacher: As you can imagine, the priority at the moment is to vaccinate people in the UK as fast as humanly possible\nteacher: Yes, sounds really frustrating!! Best of luck to her!\nstudent: I am sure, yes...\nstudent: Thanks!\nstudent: I would say that most news nowadays is related either to the vaccine or to Trump trying to stay in power after the lost elections...\nteacher: One of the ministers said that 'every government shoulder should go to every government wheel' when it comes to vaccination. Do you know the expression he is using here, in a modified form?\nteacher: Yes, definitely! Has the rollout started in Austria and Italy?\nstudent: No, I don't know that expression! I would guess it means that every part should work together effectively...but this is just a guess.\nteacher: Sorry, wrong quote! it was 'every government shoulder should be put to every government wheel'\nstudent: Yes, they started vaccinations both here and in Italy, albeit at a much slower pace...\nteacher: The expression is 'to put shoulder to the wheel', to make a sustained and concentrated effort in order to achieve something\nteacher: If you can imagine a basic mechanism that is set into motion but a person turning a wheel\nstudent: Okay! It makes sense...as in someone pushing a broken car...\nteacher: that person should put 'shoulder to the wheel' to keep it going\nteacher: yes, also a good image!\nteacher: Do you mean they are vaccinating in Italy at a slower pace? Or Austria and Italy are going at a pace slower than 'the plague island'?\nteacher: I'm just calling the UK that from now, lovingly...\nstudent: Haha...I can understand, but it sounds a bit sad\nstudent: Anyway I believe UK is 2nd or 3rd in vaccination per thousand people\nteacher: sorry, it's definitely dark!\nteacher: Oh, I see, we have to be!\nstudent: It is dark...but since you are living in the UK, I believe that calling it 'plague island' could make the situation even more grim than it actually is.\nteacher: You're right, it's definitely a defense mechanism. The situation is quite tragic!\nteacher: sorry, defence! I should stick to the UK spelling\nteacher: Ok, I've got some other expressions with 'shoulder'. Let me know which ones are familiar, please\nteacher: to rub shoulders with someone\nteacher: a shoulder to cry on\nteacher: to give someone the cold shoulder\nteacher: shoulder to shoulder\nstudent: I see...wow, shoulders are important for saying. I know some of them:\nteacher: I guess 'a shoulder to cry on' is quite intuitive, and probably similar to expressions in other languages\nstudent: a shoulder to cry on' means someone you can rely on in difficult moments (who will listen and, if necessary, give you 'a shoulder to cry on' if you need)\nteacher: Exactly!\nstudent: In Italian we don't have it! Even though it is very clear, yes.\nstudent: I believe that 'rub shoulders' means to have an argument or, at least, some sort of disagreement...is that the case?\nteacher: No, actually, it means to meet some people from time to time, especially used to show status\nteacher: She says she frequently rubs shoulders with celebrities\nstudent: Really? Wow, I really didn't know that\nstudent: and I was 'sort of sure'...okay, let me try with the last one I believe I know:\nteacher: Yes, it's a good one!\nteacher: Now, to make it more confusing, in American English it's 'rub elbows'\nstudent: to give the cold shoulder' means to ignore or avoid answering to someone, right? As in a couple, I guess...\nstudent: where one of the two gives the 'silent treatment' to the other\nstudent: is that right?\nteacher: Hmm, it definitely means to snub someone, dismiss and ignore when you see them\nteacher: but I wouldn't say it's an equivalent to the silent treatment\nstudent: Okay...I don't know why when reading it I figured a couple in that situation...but okay, so in general it means to snub someone\nteacher: a good colloquial word for 'give a silent treatment' is to sulk, you probably know this one\nstudent: After losing the presidential election, Trump gave the cold shoulder to his rival.\nteacher: Yes, good example!\nstudent: Yes, okay for the 'silent treatment' :) The last one I really don't know...\nteacher: Everyone at his new office was really friendly except for one person who gave him the cold shoulder\nteacher: shoulder to shoulder' just means next to each other and close together\nteacher: The refugees were packed shoulder to shoulder on a boat'\nstudent: As in 'they were sitting shoulder to shoulder, I bet she isn't giving him the silent treatment anymore?'\nteacher: They stood around the table shoulder to shoulder, trying to take a better look at the document\nteacher: That's possible too, actually!\nstudent: I see...but is it used, in general, with a negative or neutral connotation?\nteacher: I would say so, in case of refugees on a boat / people in a bus it expresses discomfort, of course\nteacher: but it could be neutral as you say\nteacher: In terms of body part idioms, there was one that was used a lot during the incredibly long week of the American election\nstudent: I see, so a more apt example would be: 'One thing I am not missing is public transportation: I find it uncomfortable to travel shoulder to shoulder with strangers.'\nteacher: For a while, Trump and Biden were very close, with neither clearly leading\nteacher: Trump and Biden were ___ and ____ (which body part? not shoulder)\nteacher: Yes, this is a very good example!\nteacher: re: public transport\nstudent: I wanted to write 'Trump and Biden were head to head' but it clearly isn't the case...hmm\nteacher: it's 'neck and neck'!\nteacher: I bet it comes from horse races\nstudent: public transport...okay, is 'transportation' outright wrong, or would the word 'transportation' be used in other contexts?\nstudent: I bet it does! But that makes it even easier to remember, nice one!\nteacher: No, transportation is not wrong at all! Let me think\nstudent: During the apex of his career, nobody could even think of going neck and neck with Usain Bolt.\nteacher: Believe it or not, according to the Cambridge English Dictionary, 'transportation' is American and 'transport' is British, once again!\nteacher: neck and neck!)))\nteacher: but yes :)\nstudent: Oh...now I see why I keep repeating 'head'\nstudent: that would be the Italian version...\nstudent: Haha...I guess that's the only word which is shorter for Americans!\nteacher: Ah, I see! The Russian version is 'nostril and nostril', clearly from horse races\nstudent: I'll keep that in mind\nteacher: They both sound correct, of course\nteacher: Did you manage to do the exercise on adverbials, the one from the book, by the way?\nstudent: Sorry, no: I couldn't find the right page and then I gave up...Sorry, I know I can be a better student...I'll do better next time\nstudent: But if you want we can try to do some of those right now...if you could please tell me the page again\nteacher: Don't worry! one second\nteacher: they were the first two exercises on page 103 in the book (104 in the pdf). If you don't mind, I'll leave them for you as homework\nteacher: Thank you, I'll have a look! We can't vaccinate fast enough at the moment...\nstudent: Oh, it is already almost 2 pm, I'll do them as homework!\nteacher: You can put your shoulder ___ ___ ___ and be a better student (you're an excellent student, just a chance to practise this idiom!)\nstudent: put your shoulder to the wheel\nteacher: to the wheel\nteacher: like the British govenment :)\nstudent: I was unsure about that...to the wheel, yes! Thank you :)\nteacher: Did you cook anything nice over Christmas?\nteacher: Well, I'm sure you do on a regular basis, but maybe something that stood out?\nstudent: Haha...Yes, we had 'spezzatino' (that's like Gulasch), lasagne (some friends made it at home) and I also prepared a 'panettone' (that's a typical Italian...cake I'd say...which I couldn't find here in Austria)\nteacher: Ooh, I know panettone, English people are in love with it, you can find it in shops and cafes!\nstudent: I'd say all of these dishes aren't common to prepare...but panettone is the most difficult and time consuming...I had never prepared it before!\nteacher: It's very similar to Ukrainian Easter cakes, actually\nstudent: But here in Austria they don't sell it so I had to put the shoulder to the wheel and do it myself\nstudent: Really?\nteacher: I did make a stollen in the end, it was good!\nteacher: haha, yes, the shoulder to the wheel!\nstudent: I will try with a stollen...once I can buy the panettone ;)\nteacher: Yes, if you google something called 'kulich', a Ukrainian Easter cake, that's basically panettone\nteacher: Fair enough!\nstudent: Very interesting, I'll check it out!\nstudent: Indeed, thank you for the lesson! It is 2 so I should get back to work :) Thank you for your time!\nteacher: Sure, speak to you later!\nstudent: Indeed, please send me the possible time frames and I'll check when I am available next week!\nstudent: Bye bye!\nteacher: Sorry, I got carried away. Yes, sure!",
    "student: Hi!\nstudent: Finally I've managed to type my name ))))\nteacher: Hi Alexis Smith!\nteacher: How are you? :)\nstudent: Fine, thank you\nstudent: It has been my first training of this year today\nteacher: How's your self-isolation going?\nstudent: how are you?\nteacher: Oh good, you're managing to do some exercise!\nstudent: Is it lockdown from today in the UK?\nstudent: ok, and why 'you're managing'?\nstudent: It has happened already\nteacher: Good too, thank you. It's weird to be working and looking after Emily, but we did that in the spring\nstudent: )\nstudent: I see\nteacher: Oh, I meant with 'you're managing' that you're still exercising despite self-isolating in Sophia. Over this period, not just today\nteacher: For today it's 'you have', you're right\nstudent: Ah! Sure!\nteacher: And the Ukrainian lockdown is starting in three days, isn't it?\nteacher: Is your life going to be different?\nstudent: It's funny. Today I've had a strength training, but usually it's on Mondays\nstudent: So I missed Monday because I didn't want to start with it\nstudent: I would like to start with pilates\nteacher: Yes, it's more gentle, isn't it?\nstudent: But our teacher changed these two trainings ))\nstudent: Yes, we will be under lockdown from the day after tomorrow\nstudent: You know it's Christmas Eve today in Ukraine\nstudent: And tomorrow we have Christmas\nteacher: Ooh, yes, that's right, I forgot! And I didn't make any kutya :)\nstudent: I don't really like kutya )))\nstudent: I can't eat it\nstudent: It's too sweet for me )\nteacher: What's mutha?\nstudent: I don't like all the sweet seeds (?)\nstudent: kasha I mean\nstudent: Sorry, I meant kutya\nteacher: Ah, sorry, I got confused. Got you. It's not my favourite thing either\u5362\nstudent: But my Mac decided it's mutya ))))\nstudent: But it's really mutya for me ))))\nstudent: hahaha\nteacher: I was just explaining to my Italian student that Ukrainian Easter cakes are very similar to pannetone\nteacher: Your Mac knows you well!\nstudent: You know the Russian verb 'mutit'\nteacher: I do ))\nstudent: : I was just explaining to my Italian student that Ukrainian Easter cakes are very similar to pannetone - Yes! Sure! I was very surprised when I got to know that they eat our Easter cake for Christmas ))\nteacher: I know, exactly!!\nteacher: Pannetone is very loved in the UK, you can find it in lots of shops, and Costa started doing it too\nstudent: Oh! Actually! Did you make any Olivie salad for the New Year?\nteacher: I did! Robert loves it :)\nstudent: We have lots of pannetone in shops too now\nteacher: Oh I see! Pannetone has become really popular!\nstudent: My mum made Olivie and Shuba\nstudent: I like Shuba even more than Olivie\nteacher: Ooh, I'm coming over to your mum's for the next New Year. I love shuba!\nstudent: so I started with two portions of the Shuba and then it was one portion of Olivie for dessert )))\nteacher: Emily and I made some pelmeni for the New Year, and now we want to make more dumplings. Maybe we'll try our hand at khinkali!\nstudent: wow! I think that pelmeni and similar dishes are so difficult to make\nteacher: Well, not difficult, just.... what's that word? for something that takes a lot of time?\nstudent: My mum makes them sometimes, but for me it's too complicated\nstudent: for something that takes a lot of time?  - ok! It's our first chat. If only I could remember )))\nteacher: time-consuming :))\nteacher: to consume means to use a resource\nstudent: Yes! Sure! Sorry, I have to revise it )\nteacher: For example, the UK consumes X tonnes of oil per year\nteacher: no worries))\nstudent: I see\nstudent: It's clear\nstudent: I just need to remember the word )\nteacher: and it can also mean 'eat'. During a lockdown, I consume too much chocolate\nstudent: Drinks too?\nstudent: For example\nteacher: and a formal word for someone buys / uses something is a consumer\nstudent: During a lockdown I consume too much wine\nstudent: ))\nteacher: Ah, I understand! Chocolate in the day, wine at night\nteacher: We can talk about 'consumer rights', for example\nstudent: We can )\nstudent: Now I have one little consumer\nteacher: Oh, I mean it as a way to introduce an expression, not a topic of conversation\nteacher: For example, to return a product within 28 days is one of the consumer rights\nteacher: If I remember correctly\nstudent: She stopped watching and told me no one had fed her )))\nteacher: You certainly do have a little consumer :)\nstudent: It was a joke\nstudent: About consumerism  )\nteacher: Ah, you know that one, cool!\nstudent: Ah! Actually\nteacher: yes, go on\nstudent: In Ukraine we have just 14 days to return something to a shop\nstudent: I like your law more\nteacher: Oh really? I think it's 28 days in the UK but I might be wrong!\nteacher: Don't take my word for that\nstudent: I think you are right\nstudent: Sometimes I buy something from a UK shop and I have 28 days to return it\nteacher: Yes, that sounds right\nstudent: : Don't take my word - like don't think it's 100% right?\nteacher: Yes, that's right :)\nteacher: because I might be wrong\nstudent: )\nstudent: Not in this case I think )\nstudent: And I know another difference in consumer rights\nteacher: What is it?\nstudent: For example in Ukraine you can't return underwear\nstudent: But I know in the UK you can do\nteacher: Hmm, interesting! I don't know about that one, but it shouldn't be different from any other product\nteacher: Ok, I've got some slightly weird grammar for you for today!\nstudent: In Ukraine we have a list of goods which can't be returned\nteacher: It's weird because it's different from Russian / Ukrainian\nstudent: ok )\nstudent: I'm ready )\nteacher: I see, interesting! It's important to know your consumer rights\nteacher: For example, I say, 'I have got a young child'\nteacher: And you say want to tell me that you have a young child too!\nteacher: What would you say? two words\nteacher: *sorry, you want to tell me, without 'say'\nstudent: Me too?\nteacher: Yes! sure\nteacher: or, if you want to sound more formal, you would say, 'So have I'\nteacher: So do I / So am I / So have I (depending on the grammar in the original sentence) is a more formal version of 'me too'\nstudent: I've seen the expression\nteacher: A way to agree with an affirmative (positive) statement\nstudent: But you are right it's weird for us here\nstudent: )\nteacher: Ah, wait for an even weirder part :)\nstudent: ok )))\nteacher: I haven't got a dog\nteacher: what would say about you?\nstudent: Me neither )))\nteacher: Nope! Me neither\nstudent: Ah!\nstudent: ok\nteacher: Because 'I haven't got a dog' is a negative statement\nteacher: grammatically\nstudent: yes\nteacher: You need 'me neither' or 'Neither have I'\nteacher: So, agreeing with a (+) statement is 'So do / have / am I' or 'Me too'\nteacher: agreeing with a (-) statement is 'Neither do / have / am I' or 'Me neither'\nstudent: ok!\nteacher: Neither has two pronunciations, /\u02c8na\u026a.\u00f0\u0259r/ and /\u02c8ni\u02d0.\u00f0\u0259r/\nstudent: neither /\u02c8na\u026a.\u00f0\u0259r/ and /\u02c8ni\u02d0.\u00f0\u0259r/\nstudent: Which one is British?\nteacher: haha, were we typing that at the same time?\nstudent: hahah )\nteacher: Both! two pronunciations in both British and American English!\nteacher: so just choose whichever you like\nstudent: Ah, ok!\nstudent: I like the I: one ))\nteacher: Sure! That's how Robert says it :)\nstudent: Do you prefer the second one? )\nteacher: Ok, quick practice :)\nteacher: I'm used to saying /ai/, actually\nteacher: can you agree with me, please?\nteacher: I like shuba\nstudent: nope ))\nstudent: ok\nstudent: )\nteacher: please!\nstudent: haha! So do I\nteacher: cool!\nstudent: Me too\nteacher: I have been to London\nstudent: So have I\nstudent: Me too\nstudent: Oh\nstudent: Sorry\nstudent: So have I\nteacher: Yes, well done!\nteacher: I can speak Russian\nstudent: Sorry, I can't ))\nstudent: Ok\nstudent: So can I\nteacher: yes, good :)\nteacher: I'm quite tall\nstudent: Really? )\nstudent: So am I\nteacher: Cool!)))\nteacher: I haven't got a cat\nstudent: Ok\nstudent: I had a cat\nstudent: What should I answer?\nteacher: but you haven't got one now, have you?\nstudent: No\nstudent: Ah ok!\nstudent: see\nstudent: Me neither\nteacher: Sure, well done!\nteacher: I can't go out and see people!\nstudent: Ok I can\nstudent: Ok\nstudent: Because we don't have a lockdown right now\nstudent: but ok\nstudent: me neither )\nteacher: oh sorry, but you're self-isolating! :))\nteacher: ok, thank you\nteacher: me neither or Neither ___ I\nstudent: Yes, but people don't know ))))\nstudent: neither can I\nstudent: no\nstudent: Ah\nteacher: you need a verb\nstudent: Sorry\nstudent: Neither can I\nteacher: I can't go out. - Neither ___ I\nstudent: me I it's a strange expression ))))\nstudent: Neither can I\nteacher: Yes, correct!\nteacher: Ok! Emily likes dinosaurs.\nteacher: So ___ Sophia\nstudent: So does Sophia\nteacher: Yes, well done! :)\nstudent: And where should I put an emphasis in the phrase\nstudent: on which word?\nteacher: Ok, are you ready for some stuff that is completely different from Russian?\nstudent: I'm ready )]\nteacher: I would say the stress is on 'so' and 'Sophia'\nstudent: I see\nstudent: Thank you\nteacher: Ok! You haven't got a car. (but you have, so you say...)\nstudent: sorry\nstudent: I don't know\nteacher: Yes, I have!\nstudent: Sorry\nteacher: This is how we say that a negative sentence is not true\nstudent: it's not clear\nstudent: Ok\nstudent: So you tell me that I don't have\nteacher: Sorry, one more time\nstudent: Do I have to answer that I have?\nteacher: I say to you: You haven't got a car\nteacher: You say: Yes, I have!\nteacher: I say: You are not a teacher\nstudent: I mean no but I answer yes?\nteacher: You say: Yes, I am!\nteacher: You mean that what I said is wrong, and we would use 'no' in Russian here\nstudent: Are you sure it's a weird answer?\nstudent: I mean it's too weird ))\nteacher: but in English you say 'yes'\nteacher: I know it's weird)))\nteacher: it's correct though!\nstudent: ok\nstudent: I will try )\nteacher: Ok, let's practise, say something that's not true to me, please\nstudent: You don't know Sophia from London\nteacher: Yes, I do!\nstudent: no! )))\nstudent: ok\nteacher: Yes yes yes!\nteacher: :)\nstudent: You don't like chocolate\nteacher: Yes, I do!\nteacher: You've never travelled abroad, have you?\nstudent: yes, I have\nteacher: that's right :)\nteacher: How are you feeling now? is it still strange?\nstudent: a bit )\nstudent: actually it's strange ))\nteacher: I'm sure you'll start noticing it in things you watch in English now. But it's only strange for us because it's so different from Russian\nstudent: yes, sure!\nteacher: It took me a while to get used to it, actually\nteacher: Ok, I'll talk to you tomorrow at 9.30, right?\nstudent: I see\nstudent: yes!\nstudent: See you then\nstudent: thank you )\nstudent: Have a good afternoon )\nteacher: Thank you very much, enjoy your afternoon too :)\nteacher: See you!\nstudent: thank you! Bye!",
    "student: Hello, Ms. Parker\nteacher: Hi Jessica!\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: I'm fine.\nstudent: It's so cold in Beijing now.\nteacher: Oh really? How cold?\nteacher: It's quite cold in England at the moment, -2 at night\nstudent: It's -10 now\nteacher: Oh goodness! That's proper cold!\nteacher: like in Ukraine :)\nteacher: Is there central heating in Beijing? There isn't in Shanghai, but then it doesn't get as cold in Shanghai\nstudent: Yes. In Beijing we have central heating.\nteacher: Oh good!\nstudent: Actually it depends on the area in China.\nteacher: There's been a change in the UK since we last spoke. We're now under a complete lockdown, and school are closed\nteacher: Yes, China is so vast and diverse!\nstudent: Oh, sorry about that.\nteacher: That's ok, thank you. It's necessary!\nstudent: Yes, it's necessary.\nteacher: It means my 5-year-old son is at home at the moment. I'll try to keep most of my classes, but it will depend on my husband's work too. It's a bit crazy at the moment!\nteacher: Anyway, we're good for classes next week, but I might cancel some in the future. I'll try to cancel as few classes as possible!\nstudent: It's OK.\nteacher: Thank you\nteacher: Ok, let's revise a few words from Monday\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: brave, courageous, courage, intelligent, kind-hearted, bright, humble, patient, smart, ambitious, an achiever, cunning\nteacher: First question. Which two words are nouns?\nstudent: courage\nstudent: achiever?\nteacher: Yes, absolutely!\nteacher: An achiever = someone for whom achievement is important and they are ready to work hard to achieve what they want\nteacher: Ok, which word is a British synonym to 'intelligent'?\nstudent: bright\nteacher: Yes! And an American one?\nstudent: smart\nteacher: Yes!\nteacher: and which one means 'clever and sometimes doing dishonest things'?\nstudent: ambitious and cunning\nstudent: If I have to pick one, then I will pick cunning\nteacher: Yes, true! 'ambitious' doesn't mean a person is ready to do dishonest things\nteacher: Ok, well done! Have you got any questions about the meaning of any of these words?\nstudent: These words are OK for me.\nstudent: These\nteacher: great!\nteacher: Oh, did you have a chance to do the quiz I sent you? Where did the Hat sort you, if it's ok for me to ask?\nstudent: Yes. It told me: you are a Gryffindor.\nteacher: Ah! Congratulations! It's what you hoped for, isn't it?\nteacher: Or did you hope to be a Hufflepuff?\nstudent: Yes. I like it very much\nteacher: I bet! I wish I was a Gryffindor :)\nstudent: I thought the sorting hat may put me into Hufflepuff.\nstudent: But the result is Gryffindor.\nteacher: Well, Hufflepuff is a fine house\nstudent: Yes, I think so.\nteacher: What qualities do you think are important in a friend? (to use the new words)\nteacher: sorry, something went wrong!\nteacher: For example, I would like to be friends with a courageous person, because they will probably be doing lots of new and interesting things!\nstudent: I would like to be friends with someone I can understand and who can understand me, because it's great to share your ideas with someone who can know you.\nteacher: I am back! Something went wrong with the programme, or maybe with my laptop or the connection, sorry\nstudent: Hello\nteacher: Hello!\nteacher: Yaay! it's working\nteacher: not sure what happened there\nstudent: Looks like something's wrong.\nstudent: It's OK now.\nteacher: I've got your answer about a good friend, thank you!\nteacher: Yes, someone who can understand you\nteacher: What about a good leader? What should they be like?\nstudent: I think a good leader must be very passionate.\nteacher: very passionate?\nstudent: Yes, passionate\nteacher: the adjective is passionate, feeling very strongly about things\nteacher: Ok, interesting! Why?\nteacher: Ah, you seem to still be having problems with the chatroom...\nstudent: I think a good leader must be very passionate, because a person who is passionate can give you confidence.\nstudent: sorry, passionate\nteacher: Oh, I see. A passionate person can inspire others, right?\nstudent: Yes, inspire is better.\nteacher: Yes, I know what you mean!\nteacher: What about your profession? What qualities should a person have to be good at it?\nstudent: As a computer engineer, I think the most important quality is to be patient.\nteacher: Ok, interesting! Is it because things always go wrong with computers? :)\nstudent: Because if you are impatient, you can make mistakes easily.\nteacher: Yes, makes sense! You need a lot of attention to detail\nstudent: Yes, exactly\nteacher: Would you say you are a patient person? I think I would get too frustrated if I had to work with computers. I am patient with people (I'd like to think), but I don't think I'd be patient with computer code!\nstudent: Actually I think I'm a patient person. If I work on the computer code, I must concentrate on it all the time. If I'm disturbed, I will spend some time to re-concentrate on it again.\nteacher: I see! That's a great ability!\nteacher: Which do you think is more important, being humble or being ambitious? Can someone be humble and ambitious at the same time?\nstudent: Thanks.\nteacher: Oh goodness, the same problem again! Sorry about that\nteacher: is it working now?\nteacher: oh yes, it is!\nstudent: I think being humble is more important than being anbitious. Because being humble can let you stay in a peaceful state of mind, and it's a good element of success, to keep your mind peaceful.\nteacher: That's an interesting thought!\nstudent: The chatroom is not Ok today.\nteacher: No, it's not working at all! I just dropped you an email\nteacher: So about all this, I'm not sure what's going on! Maybe the server...\nteacher: I will talk to you on Monday, hope we can have a good class then!",
    "student: Hello!\nteacher: Hiya!\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: I'm fine! I have a full house here ))))\nteacher: both Liam and Ethan?\nstudent: How are you?\nstudent: Liam, Ethan, the nanny, my mom\nstudent: My mom visited quite unexpectedly\nteacher: Oh goodness, well, I appreciate your commitment in showing up for the class!\nstudent: Oh sure! I was on my way to school when my mom called and said she's visiting\nteacher: I'm good, thank you, but really going stir-crazy this time around I feel!\nteacher: Ah, were you trying to escape to school?\nstudent: How long will the lockdown last?\nstudent: Always)) The school has become my escape\nteacher: No one knows! Until it has at least some effect. It's proving very hard to reign in this 'new variant' of the virus\nteacher: Haha, yes, it's the same for Sarah Brown I think\nstudent: I think so too. It's really hard to concentrate at home.\nteacher: Well, no, the government said that school are closed until the end of February, but it's also felt that not enough people abide by the rules this time, which, coupled with a more contagious virus, might mean that the lockdown won't work\nteacher: *schools\nstudent: I can't help but wonder is this what life is going to be like from now on. The lockdowns, the new variants of the virus...\nteacher: They are throwing everything at vaccinating people at the moment, which is our way out\nstudent: Until it evolves and the vaccine won't work any more\nteacher: I know, so scary!\nstudent: How's your gardening? Let's talk about something positive)))\nteacher: How are you guys? I know you had covid over the winter holidays, is it ok to ask you about that?\nteacher: Haha, well, talking at cross purposes ever so slightly here\nteacher: There's not enough to do in the garden for me at the moment! I daydream about spring and summer. But we did plant some trees this weekend, a sour cherry, a plum and an apple\nstudent: Sure. We're fine. The covid was a strange experience, losing the sense of smell and taste\nteacher: Oh I bet!\nstudent: A sour cherry yay! The one for varenyky\nteacher: Exactly Emily, exactly :))))\nstudent: Yum!\nteacher: It's a very young sapling, unfortunately, so it's probably going to be a 5-year wait\nteacher: before my first vareniki\nstudent: Oh no\nteacher: But I can do it!\nstudent: but it's worth it\nteacher: Yes! :)\nstudent: I hope the first crop will be a bumper one\nteacher: Ooh, thank you :)) yes, me too!\nteacher: Ok, shall we dive in with some exam prep?\nstudent: Yes!

It's a beautiful piece\nteacher: But it doesn't cover all types of love I feel\nstudent: It sure doesn't\nteacher: For example, that's what parental love is supposed to look like, but not the love of a child towards a parent\nstudent: Right\nstudent: Here's what I've found\nstudent: In 1 Corinthians 13:4-8, Paul describes the many attributes of the highest form of 'love'\u2014agape, in the Greco-Christian translation\u2014that the Christian community should strive to embody: Love for God, and Love for one another.\nteacher: Yes, the Greek language has all these different words for love, doesn't it?\nteacher: I presume 'agape' is Greek\nstudent: I think so. It's a very rich language\nstudent: I can ask our teacher Sophia Reyes. He knows Greek\nteacher: And there are two words for love in Ukrainian!\nteacher: But only one in English or Russian\nteacher: Oh cool! Ancient Greek or modern Greek?\nstudent: Probably both.\nteacher: Impressive!\nteacher: A recent report has warned of global food   unlessSHORT the current system of farming and food distribution is changed.

Or shall I let you go?\nstudent: This chat is a clumsy piece of work )))\nteacher: A bit, yes!\nstudent: Yes, I have\nteacher: Sure!\nteacher: The key words should be in their right places in this one\nteacher: The population is expected to rise to around 8.3 billion in the next   twenty years, and    URBAN is set to continue, and it is  expected that 65-70% of the world\u2019s population will live in cities.   Increasing world PROSPEROUS   will lead to the rise in demand for  energy, food and fresh water.\nstudent: urbanisation\nstudent: prosperity\nteacher: yes, perfect!\nteacher: The report also considers the billion people worldwide who EAT      and are therefore obese to be another example of the   FAIL of the current system to provide health and well-  being to the world\u2019s population.\nstudent: overeat\nstudent: failure\nteacher: Yes, sure! Sorry, I've been preparing the last bit\nteacher: here goes\nteacher: The authors believe that the APPLY    of new technologies can  play a role in MINIMAL    future food shortages. They see cloning,  nanotechnology and genetic MODIFY    as potential solutions.  However, although many of these technologies have been adopted   worldwide, there is still  RESIST   to their use in parts of Europe.\nstudent: application\nstudent: minimising\nstudent: modification\nstudent: resistance\nteacher: Yes! Let me check if minimizing can be spelled with an s\nteacher: Yes, the UK variant :)\nstudent: should be... an American\nstudent: an American variant\nstudent: Z is UK?\nstudent: Or US?\nteacher: I think the American -ize has infiltrated British spelling a bit\nteacher: US -ize and Brisith -ise\nstudent: haha\nteacher: But I see a lot of -ize in the UK!\nstudent: I've always thought the other way around\nteacher: I've actually missed one, and it's an interesting one. Check this out\nteacher: A recent report has warned of global food shortages    unless  the current system of farming and food distribution is changed. The   report highlights fears that currently rapid increases in yields come at   the expense of sustainability   , and that unless action is taken,  hunger and NUTRIENT    will become growing problems.\nstudent: malnutrition\nteacher: Ah, well done!\nstudent: Thanks!\nteacher: Wonderful job :)\nstudent: Thanks))) considering the circumstances\nstudent: Let's plan next week then?\nteacher: It's funny, the Cambridge English Dictionary redirects from 'realise' to 'realize' and then there's a not in brackets (UK spelling usually realise)\nteacher: I need to see which days David has meetings! Can we text about it later, please?\nstudent: Sure!\nstudent: Let me know\nteacher: *a note\nteacher: Definitely! Thanks and enjoy your evening!\nstudent: You too! Thank you for the lesson!\nteacher: It's my pleasure. Bye! :)\nstudent: Bye!",
    "student: Hi Ms. Johnson!\nteacher: Hi Aiden Smith.!\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: Fine thank you\nstudent: And you?\nteacher: Are you at home or at work?\nteacher: Same old, thank you. Lockdown life!\nstudent: At work now, I've had one more strength training today\nstudent: Maybe tomorrow my muscles will thank me )\nteacher: Oh cool! I usually try to avoid strength training :)\nstudent: Me too )\nteacher: You mean tomorrow?\nteacher: It's good to challenge yourself though, well done you!\nstudent: But I would like to have three trainings per week and there is one pilates, one yoga and one strength training every week\nstudent: Sure, sorry! Tomorrow )\nstudent: Why did I use yesterday )\nteacher: No worries :)\nstudent: Actually now I'm not sure that I need to challenge myself often )\nteacher: Were your muscles really sore?\nstudent: Even more\nstudent: I try to be more relaxed )\nteacher: Ha, I see! This can be a challenge too, but it is important!\nstudent: There are too many things to worry about in our lives and I try to be\nstudent: ohhh\nteacher: Oh, have you watched anything interesting in English recently? How's it going with Netflix?\nstudent: I try to be quiet in my own one )\nstudent: Agree! It's a challenge for me to be relaxed ))\nstudent: Ok\nstudent: It's funny\nteacher: Yes, well said! Did you mean 'quiet'? As in 'peaceful and quiet'?\nstudent: We've started watching the Kominsky Method with Jacob\nteacher: Oh, I love the Kominsky Method!!!\nstudent: It's his first series ) He feels beaten\nstudent: )\nstudent: is it the right expression?\nteacher: Haha, well, it's a good series to start with!\nstudent: Have you seen it? )\nstudent: I like it\nstudent: It's easy and funny )\nteacher: He feels defeated? Like you won (or TV won) and he lost?\nteacher: Yes, we watched both seasons. I think there are only two seasons\nstudent: Like he's never seen a series and thought that he wouldn't\nstudent: And now he's watching\nstudent: *he's never watched\nstudent: Yes. We've started the second season recently\nteacher: Hmm, I'm trying to think how he might feel\nteacher: Is he pleased he's watching it now?\nteacher: The actors are just superb in it\nstudent: Like he lost the battle )\nteacher: Ah, ok! let me have a think\nstudent: It seems like he enjoys the Kominsky Method )\nteacher: I think he's feeling resigned\nstudent: like in chess )\nteacher: accepting that something you do not like will happen because you cannot change it'\nstudent: Yeah\nteacher: Yes, exactly! Like 'resign the king', right? Is that what they said in the Queen's Gambit?\nstudent: Actually\nteacher: resign is an interesting verb\nstudent: Have you seen a Lego chess set?\nstudent: Yes! Like resign the king )\nteacher: to resign means to leave your job. For example, you go to your boss and say, 'I resign'\nteacher: Another example: teachers in England are calling on the education secretary to resign\nteacher: because they're not pleased with the job he is doing\nteacher: Ministers and other government officials can resign\nstudent: uvolen?\nstudent: )\nteacher: Well, there are actually two verbs in Russian. Uvolitsya for the first situation and podat' v otstavku for the second, right?\nstudent: Ah! Sure\nteacher: But if a person leaves their job because they want to become a pensioner and not work anymore, the verb is 'to retire'\nstudent: ok! I see\nteacher: And the time when a person is a pensioner is called 'retirement'\nteacher: Anyway, we can also say 'he's got a resigned look on his face'\nteacher: because he realized he broke his own rule and is not watching a TV series :))\nteacher: What about Lego chess? I haven't heard of that. Is it an actual Lego set?\nstudent: Yes!\nstudent: One moment\nstudent: Does the link work?\nteacher: Oh wow! Yes, it does! A Lego chess set indeed!\nteacher: very cool\nstudent: yes, I like it\nstudent: But you know\nstudent: Sometimes it breaks when you play with it\nstudent: Emma has two Frozen Lego sets\nstudent: Do you know the cartoon?\nteacher: In English, some houses are marketed as 'retirement property'. People don't have to live near work anymore, they can live somewhere nice or maybe in a neighbourhood with other retired people\nteacher: Yes, I was thinking that, it's Lego, so it would break when you play it. Have you got it? Do you play with Jacob?\nteacher: Yes, I know Frozen!\nstudent: So when she is playing with it the construction breaks?\nstudent: Is it the right expression?\nteacher: it's break-broke-broken\nteacher: it's breaking\nstudent: Nope, we don't have the Lego chess set! Maybe it's a good present\nstudent: But it's quite expensive\nstudent: Sure! It's breaking! Sorry\nteacher: No worries. Yes, these are the troubles with Lego. It breaks and it's expensive!\nteacher: Ok! Grammar time!\nteacher: Remember our modals of deduction? could / might / may / must / can't\nstudent: yes.. 0\nstudent: I think so )\nteacher: He is 84. I'm sure he is retired now. ---- He ___ ___ retired now\nstudent: ok\nstudent: ok\nstudent: He must be\nteacher: Yes, absolutely!\nteacher: He is only 50! I'm sure he is not retired yet. ---- He ___ ___ retired yet\nstudent: can't be\nteacher: Yes, that's right!\nteacher: And could / might / may express everything in between, that we're not so sure about\nteacher: What's happening in the latest episode of Kominsky that you watched?\nstudent: hm\nstudent: let me think )))\nteacher: sure\nstudent: ok! Lisa and Sandy have decided to be friends\nstudent: the friends?\nteacher: friends!\nteacher: Oh, I remember!\nteacher: What else? :)\nstudent: And she invited him to watch a film and then she was drunk because of too much wine\nstudent: She was consuming wine ) ?\nteacher: Ah, I remember that one too, cool!\nteacher: She did consime too much wine!\nstudent: ok!\nstudent: And the other man\nstudent: What is his name\nstudent: hm\nteacher: Norman?\nstudent: Yes!\nstudent: I like him actually )\nteacher: Me too!\nstudent: Ok! Norman. Do you remember his daugter?\nteacher: yes!\nstudent: She has just returned from her rehab\nstudent: And she met Norman's girlfriend\nteacher: Oh, yes\nstudent: And then he (isportil)) all\nteacher: but Norman threw her out because he said he was just waiting 'for the other shoe to drop'?\nteacher: Yes, I remember. He ruined everything!\nstudent: And his daughter went away and the woman too because of his behavior\nteacher: yes, I remember!\nstudent: Yes!! He ruined everything\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: Ok, perfect. Now we bring in the modals! Do you think Lisa and Sandy could be good friends?\nstudent: And then he apologized to the daughter\nteacher: He apologized to his daughter?\nstudent: I think they can't be good friends\nteacher: Why not?\nstudent: He apologized to his daughter yes!\nstudent: Because it's not Sandy's main idea actually\nstudent: He would like to be a couple with her I think\nteacher: Ok :))) I see what you mean\nstudent: To date her\nteacher: a couple\nteacher: yes!\nstudent: Etc. ))\nteacher: etc!))\nstudent: Yes! )\nteacher: Ok! Do you think they might be good together? as a couple/\nteacher: ?\nstudent: 1.0\nstudent: They have the same sense of humor. It's the first thing in a couple I think )\nstudent: So\nteacher: Oh really? If it's 100%, they ___ be good together\nstudent: They must\nstudent: they\nteacher: Yes :)))\nteacher: Ah, interesting! I wouldn't say David Smith and I have the same sense of humour!\nteacher: Well, only some of it is the same\nstudent: It was a joke ))\nstudent: But I like people with the same sense of humor I have\nteacher: No, it's an interesting thought!\nteacher: Do you and Jacob have a similar sense of humour?\nstudent: I mean not just people to date or to marry )\nstudent: Friends too\nstudent: Yes we have I think\nstudent: And maybe it becomes more and more similar )))))\nstudent: It's not a good thing\nteacher: Oh, that's definitely true! It becomes more similar with time\nstudent: I think my authentic sense of humor is better ))))\nstudent: haha\nteacher: Haha, I see! Your pre-Jacob sense of humour :))\nstudent: yes ))))\nteacher: I think I was more sarcastic before David Smith, so he must be having a good influence on me\nstudent: I like sarcastic people )\nteacher: Like Norman!\nstudent: Yes!\nstudent: It was my thought )\nteacher: Do you think Norman and his girlfriend might stay together?\nteacher: Ah, he is such a brilliant actor. Have you seen 'Little Miss Sunshine'?\nstudent: No\nstudent: Is it a series or a movie?\nteacher: It's an excellent movie, with him. My sister got me to watch it and it's one of my favourites now\nteacher: It's quite old now!\nstudent: I'm not sure. They might (may, could) be together\nteacher: Yes, definitely!\nstudent: I have to watch it\nstudent: I like the actor\nstudent: he is really cool\nteacher: Oh yes, I really recommend!\nteacher: Ok! can't / must / might / may / could + Vinfinitive are ways to talk about what might happen in the present / future\nstudent: sorry )\nteacher: welcome back!))\nstudent: thank you ))\nstudent: I was just shocked that we have new grammar today ))\nteacher: Wait for it! More is coming!\nteacher: And you decided to run? :))))\nstudent: Yes ))\nteacher: Ah, wait, first we'll see how to use them in the past\nstudent: ok )\nteacher: For example, I look out of the window in the morning and see that the street is wet\nteacher: Ah! It must have rained at night\nteacher: or the street is dry\nteacher: It can't have rained at night!\nstudent: I see\nteacher: the same modal verbs + have + past participle (the third form of the verb)\nstudent: ok!\nteacher: Norman really misses his wife. They must have been very happy together\nstudent: yes!\nteacher: But Sandy is divorced. He and his ex-wife can't have been very happy together\nteacher: And of course, could / might / may are used for everything in between\nstudent: ex-wives )\nteacher: yes :)\nteacher: His boots are covered in mud. He might have walked through the fields\nteacher: The modals of deduction, like the method that Sherlock Holmes used\nstudent: Or just might have jumped in muddy puddles )\nteacher: Exactly!)))\nteacher: Aiden Smith. must have watched a lot of Peppa Pig :)))\nstudent: haha\nstudent: You must have watched it too\nstudent: If you know what I mean )\nteacher: I actually haven't watched as many as you have! Laura was never really into it\nteacher: as many episodes of Peppa I mean\nstudent: It's a pity\nstudent: I love the humor in the cartoon\nteacher: I always feel sorry for Daddy Pig though\nstudent: haha\nteacher: They are so mean to him sometimes\nteacher: Ok, I'll send you a link to some exercises, to practise modals of deduction in the past\nstudent: Now I see that you can't have watched much Peppa\nstudent: He is quite self-confident I think\nteacher: Well, yes, it was enough for me!))\nstudent: so it's fear )\nteacher: Ah, I see! Daddy Pig must have changed in the later seasons then :)\nstudent: aha\nstudent: ok )\nteacher: Ok, I'll let you go! I'll send you the link. Have a nice afternoon! Speak to you on Friday :)\nstudent: you too\nstudent: Thank you\nstudent: see you! )\nteacher: Bye!",
    "student: Hi Ms. Rodriguez! You didn't answer my e-mail, I hope now is a good time for the lesson! How are you?\nteacher: HI Sarah! I did not? Oh goodness, I totally thought I had!!\nteacher: Yes, I thought I had answered you and we had scheduled the lesson for now. Sorry about that! And good that you're here!\nstudent: No problem :) How is it going?\nteacher: I've just had a look and my email is a draft, I must have forgotten to hit send\nteacher: Good, thank you. We're nice and safe and still able to work and 'homeschool' our son (which is an adventure, shall we say)\nteacher: But the UK is not in a good place right now!\nstudent: It happens to everyone, especially if you have children at home..\nteacher: How are you and yours?\nstudent: Indeed, the UK is not doing well...unfortunately the situation isn't much brighter here.\nteacher: Exactly, multitasking is far from being an effective mode\nteacher: Oh really?\nstudent: I am fine thank you! Except for the fact that one of the children decided he wouldn't sleep until 11pm, which is very tiresome as the evening was my only moment of 'peace'\nteacher: Oh, I can imagine!\nstudent: Well, the total number of cases is lower, but we are still on high alert and it isn't clear how many restrictions will be lifted at the end of the month\nteacher: It's very frustrating to not get that time in the evening\nteacher: I see! I don't think the UK will be able to lift any restrictions. The numbers have maybe started to fall (very cautiously optimistic), but they are still at 46 thousand new cases a day and hospitals are at breaking point\nteacher: Unfortunately, this time round people are not adhering to lockdown rules as well as they did in spring\nstudent: People, unfortunately, are either tired or do not feel the gravity of this situation anymore!\nteacher: Yes, exactly. The talk of 'it's just a flu' is back it seems\nstudent: That's happening everywhere, I believe, and in Italy they also decided to go for a crisis in the goverment so that we weren't missing out on anything\nteacher: A crisis in the government?\nstudent: Yes, one of the parties in the current goverment decided to leave their duties as ministers; they now have to decide what to do, and possibly remove Conte (the current prime minister).\nstudent: I mean, Italy is known for short goverments, many of them lasted for no more than a few months...but with the current situation I think it only increases the risk of a mishandling of the current situation.\nteacher: Oh no, possibly the worst time for this! I must admit I haven't been keeping an eye on what's happening in Europe; all eyes are on the United States again. I think there's actually a pitfall in that. We've spent weeks watching the American elections and then Trump's demeanor and missed out on what's happening here or with our neighbours\nteacher: Yes, I see how it must be worrying for you!\nteacher: Have you had a chance to do those grammar exercises? Or shall we have a look at them now?\nstudent: I tried to do the first one\nstudent: Even though I am not too sure I did it well\nstudent: but we can try\nstudent: to review it\nteacher: Yes, let's have a go! It was error correction, wasn't it?\nstudent: Exactly\nteacher: After 1997, exports have been booming.\nteacher: What do you think of this one?\nstudent: I would change it to: Since 1997, exports have been booming.\nteacher: And you would be exactly right!\nteacher: When I'll get back, I'll tell you all about it.\nstudent: I am less sure about this one; I would change the when to a 'once'...'Once I'll get back, I'll tell you about it'...\nteacher: The problem is with a tense here, not a linking word\nstudent: Hmm...when I get back, I'll tell you about it...\nteacher: Yes, exactly!\nteacher: once' would work too\nstudent: In the next sentence I would also change a linking word (When -&gt; On), would that be okay?\nteacher: When examining it more closely, he realized that the ticket was for the next day.\nteacher: Yes, exactly! Because you need 'as a result' meaning here\nteacher: Another option is '____ examined it more closely, he realized...'\nstudent: Hmm...\nteacher: Having examined it\nstudent: Oh, I was trying to find another linking word but I see the trick was to remove it altogether\nstudent: *altogether\nteacher: Yes, sorry!\nteacher: Having talked about coronavirus and politics, we moved on to grammar.\nstudent: But, if you use 'having examined it' you are suggesting that the realization came after the examination, in a separate following moment, right?\nteacher: Yes, I would say so!\nstudent: After talking about covid and politics, we moved on to grammar.\nstudent: I wouldn't use 'on' here, right?\nteacher: Hmm, let me think\nteacher: No, I think 'on' does carry this 'reason' meaning\nteacher: rather than just time\nstudent: Okay, that's something I hadn't really noticed before! Thank you :)\nteacher: In the rule section on the previous page they put 'on' in the bit where one action follows another one very quickly\nteacher: On phoning the reception yet again, she was told that the repairman was on his way'\nstudent: Yes, they do not cover a 'reason' meaning...\nteacher: And it's definitely not colloquial, the same as 'having...'\nteacher: just checking the connection\nteacher: Oh, it seems to be working, good!\nstudent: Coool :) We still had some sentences\nstudent: left\nteacher: Yes! Once she will have understood the procedures, she will work much faster\nstudent: I wrote: Once she understands the procedures, she will work much faster.\nteacher: Totally acceptable. Or: Once she has understood the procedures, she will work much faster\nteacher: to stress the completion of the action in the clause, we can use a perfect tense\nteacher: I'd no sooner taken my seat when the fire alarm went off\nstudent: I found this one hard...looking at the grammar I guess they suggest 'I'd no sooner taken my seat than the fire alarm went off'\nteacher: Yes, exactly! And yes, it is tricky and low frequency!\nteacher: Not just formal, but bookish I would say\nstudent: But I realized that the expression 'I had no sooner taken...' sounds a bit foreign to me\nteacher: Yes, not surprisingly\nteacher: As our bus didn't leave for another hour, so we didn't have to rush\nstudent: If you say it is bookish than okay, indeed I probably have seen it only few times.\nstudent: As our bus didn't leave for another hour, we didn't have to rush.\nteacher: Yes! Or the second option?\nstudent: I would maybe change the 'as' to a 'since'\nteacher: Hmm. One option is to remove 'so' as you did, the other is to remove 'as'\nteacher: It's either as or so\nstudent: Oh now I see it!\nteacher: Does it make sense?\nteacher: Yes, sure! :)\nstudent: Yes, absolutely...it is just that somehow I didn't think about removing the first word\nteacher: Sure\nteacher: There's a lovely chapter on collocations in this book. You are familiar with the concept of collocations, aren't you?\nstudent: To be honest, no I am not. Or, at least, I don't associate the word with a grammar concept\nstudent: (even though it looks like a Latin word so I can guess it concerns word positioning)\nteacher: Ah, I moved to vocabulary here without signalling it, sorry!\nteacher: Collocations are words that go together\nteacher: For example, we say 'time flies / goes by / passes'\nstudent: No problem...okay, then the etymology is probably 'to be positioned together'.\nteacher: but not 'time travels / runs' or something like that\nstudent: Oh, I see...that's interesting...\nteacher: Oh wow, I must admit I haven't thought of that, but you must be right! Co + locate\nteacher: Naturally, you already now a multitude of collocations\nstudent: Would the example 'on one hand/on the other hand' instead of 'On one side/on the other side'  (as I used to write) fit also the definition of collocations?\nteacher: *know\nteacher: Absolutely\nstudent: (just for your curiosity: 'collocare' in Italian means 'to place/to position' so for me it was an obvious guess)\nteacher: Collocations often have this figurative meaning, like on the other hand (where no actual hands are involved)\nteacher: Ah, I see! Thank you, this is very valuable!\nstudent: You're welcome :)\nstudent: I am wondering...does the definition involve, in general, the kind of adjectives that can go with a noun or is it more subtle?\nteacher: Some collocations are 'fixed'. They are rigid, you can't change one component, and the whole collocation has one meaning, like a word\nteacher: Yes! These and more. The examples from the book are 'an academic year', but not 'a year of study' or anything else\nteacher: but they are not necessarily adjective + noun\nteacher: they can be things like 'in contrast to', 'on the dot', 'safe and sound'\nstudent: Okay, that's interesting :)\nstudent: Which chapter talks about them? I can try to do some exercises on them for the next week\nteacher: Definitely, I was going to say that. Let me look up the page for you\nteacher: It's page 28 in the book (29 in the pdf). Page 28 gives an overview of collocations with some examples, and the following page has some exercises. Just do what you have time for!\nteacher: I haven't got my schedule for the next week just yet, I'll email you about possible time slots again, ok? I promise to reply this time! Are there any days that won't suit you?\nstudent: Okay, thank you for the pages!\nstudent: On Monday and Wednesday my wife works, so I'd avoid them...\nteacher: Ok, that's convenient because my husband will be in meetings too\nstudent: and, to be honest, I prefer to have the lesson at 13 Austrian time, or even later, if possible...but if it isn't possible then that's not a problem\nstudent: Thank you for your time :) Have a nice day!\nteacher: I see! I'll see what I can do! Have a nice day, thank you!",
    "teacher: Hi Sophia Smith!\nstudent: Hello, Ms. Catherine Anderson.\nteacher: How's it going?\nstudent: I'm fine.\nstudent: I'm still in Beijing now.\nteacher: Have you heard anything from Fudan university? Is there any progress with your application?\nstudent: For the RA, six months are not enough, so I cannot go to Fudan now.\nteacher: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that! Are you disappointed?\nstudent: Yes. A little.\nstudent: I need to wait for the official enrolment.\nteacher: Oh, I'm sorry! Does it mean you're not moving to Shanghai at all?\nteacher: I see!\nstudent: I will wait until September\nteacher: Ah, I hope it'll work out for you in September!\nstudent: But the impact of the pandemic is also more serious in China.\nstudent: Thanks.\nteacher: Yes, I've read that there are more cases in China now\nteacher: Are there more restrictions in place? Do people have to wear masks again?\nstudent: Yes, the situation in my hometown is a little serious, so the government imposed a lockdown again.\nstudent: We always wear masks\nstudent: If you don\u2019t wear a mask, you can\u2019t go on the subway.\nteacher: I see! Have you had to wear masks since the beginning of the pandemic?\nteacher: oh no, are we having connection problems again?\nstudent: Yes, we must wear masks in public places in China.\nstudent: I couldn\u2019t send messages just before.\nteacher: Yes, I realized that. I hope it'll be working!\nteacher: Ok, shall we do a bit of B2 exam practice?\nstudent: OK. It's great, thanks.\nteacher: Lovely. I've prepared some key word transformation for you today.\nteacher: As you probably remember, you have an original sentence and a sentence you need to change it into using a key word\nteacher: You can't change the key word\nteacher: And the meaning should be as close to the original sentence as possible\nstudent: Can you give me an example?\nteacher: For example, your original sentence is\nteacher: It's been six months since I last saw Dan.\nteacher: the key word is 'seen'\nteacher: I _______ seen Dan for over six months.\nstudent: I haven\u2019t seen Dan for over six months.\nteacher: You can use 2-5 words\nstudent: have\nstudent: sorry, let me see.\nteacher: No, you're right! I haven't seen Dan for over six months\nteacher: Sorry, I've made a mistake! I ________ Dan for over six months.\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: Sorry, ok, next one!\nteacher: John is interested in knowing more about astronomy\nteacher: The key word is: like\nteacher: John ________ more about astronomy.\nstudent: would like to know\nteacher: Yes, perfect!\nteacher: Ok, could you give me a synonym for arrive? It's a phrasal verb that starts with 'turn'\nteacher: arrive = turn ___\nstudent: turn up\nteacher: turn up\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: arrive at the party = turn up at the party\nteacher: Marian only arrived at the party at 9 o'clock, so her friends were a bit annoyed.\nteacher: The key word is: turn\nteacher: Marian _____ at the party until 9 o'clock, so her friends were a bit annoyed.\nstudent: turned up\nstudent: turned up at the party?\nstudent: wait\nteacher: Ah, this is a tricky one. The structure we often use is 'negative + until'\nteacher: Yes, sure\nstudent: hasn't turned up\nstudent: hasn't turned up\nteacher: Nearly! You need past simple\nstudent: didn't turn up\nteacher: Yes, you've got it :)\nteacher: Some examples of 'negative + until'\nteacher: I didn't have my first coffee until lunchtime\nteacher: This writer didn't write his first novel until he was in his forties\nteacher: I can't see my friends until the end of the lockdown\nteacher: Could you give me an example too, please?\nstudent: OK.\nstudent: I can't watch the football game until this Saturday.\nteacher: Yes, good example, thank you!\nteacher: Ok, next sentence\nteacher: Advance payment isn't necessary for attendance at school clubs\nteacher: Do you know the expression 'advance payment'?\nstudent: Yes.\nteacher: OK, cool. The key word is: in\nstudent: Advance payment means you need to pay before you use something.\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: You don't need _____ to attend school clubs\nteacher: Yes, exactly right\nstudent: pay in advance\nstudent: to pay in advance\nteacher: absolutely, to pay in advance\nteacher: This is probably the hardest task in B2 Use of English, and you would get two points for each sentence. For something like 'pay in advance' you would get one point. It's the correct expression but there's a mistake. And 'to pay in advance' would be two points :)\nteacher: I only went to see that film because you told me how good it was\nteacher: the key word is: have\nteacher: I ________ to see this film if you hadn't told me how good it was.\nstudent: Sorry. I don\u2019t know.\nteacher: No worries, we will come back to it in a minute, ok?\nteacher: One last sentence to transform\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: I'm afraid these jeans have a hole in them\nteacher: key word: there\nteacher: I'm afraid that ________ these jeans.\nstudent: there is a hole in\nteacher: Yes, perfect!\nteacher: Ok, a bit of grammar in this case!\nteacher: You probably remember that I lived in China for year\nteacher: When I lived there, I learned to use chopsticks.\nstudent: Yes.\nstudent: It's great.\nteacher: But I only learned because I lived in China! If this was not the case, I wouldn't know how to use chopsticks\nteacher: Thank you, I'm not nearly as good with chopsticks as you probably are :)\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: I lived in China 5 years ago. This is a situation in the past\nteacher: If I hadn't lived in China, I wouldn't have learned to use chopsticks!\nteacher: But I did live in China! If we want to talk about an imaginary, unreal situation in the past, we use this structure\nteacher: If + had + past participle, would + have + past participle\nteacher: The past participle is the third form of the verb (shopped, lifted, written, run etc.)\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: If I hadn't lived in China, I wouldn't have seen the beautiful lake in Hanzhou\nteacher: But I did! I'm talking about an unreal situation, in the past\nteacher: If I had been to New York, I would have gone to see a play on Broadway.\nteacher: Have I ever been to New York?\nstudent: No.\nteacher: Correct! And I haven't seen a play on Broadway\nteacher: But if I had, I would have :)\nteacher: Ok, have you ever been to the UK?\nstudent: If I had been to the UK, I would have seen a match in Liverpool.\nteacher: Haha, yes! Excellent example!\nteacher: Ok, let's go back to our sentence transformation\nteacher: I only went to see that film because you told me how good it was.\nteacher: I ________ to see that film if you hadn't told me how good it was.\nteacher: the key word is have\nstudent: would have not\nteacher: ah, you just need the verb there. would have not ??\nstudent: Yes.\nstudent: have not\nteacher: the verb in the original sentence is 'went', so you need....\nstudent: had not\nteacher: no, would have not is correct!\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: but you need one more word\nstudent: Oh, sorry.\nteacher: no problem\nteacher: I would not have gone to see the film, right?\nteacher: you just needed 'gone' there\nteacher: go-went-gone\nstudent: Yes. Thanks.\nteacher: No worries\nteacher: Let's think of more real-life examples. I'll give you one from my life. If I hadn't married an Englishman, I wouldn't have moved to the UK\nstudent: Haha, great.\nteacher: :))\nstudent: Yes, you did.\nteacher: Your example, please! Real or imaginary\nstudent: OK.\nstudent: If I hadn't had a dog, I would not have known how dogs express themselves.\nteacher: Good example!\nteacher: I didn't know you had a dog, you'll have to tell me about it next time!\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: Sorry, Internet!\nstudent: See you next time.\nteacher: Wait a sec\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: I've got to cancel our Monday class, sadly. But we can have a class on Thursday, ok?\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: Sorry about that, lockdown scheduling challenges\nteacher: Lovely, speak to you then!\nstudent: No problem\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: Ok, bye!\nstudent: Bye bye.",

If + present simple, will + verb\nstudent: so\nstudent: If the weather is frosty, we will have snow\nstudent: we\nteacher: Yes, that's right!\nteacher: Generally, you won't have a future form with 'will' after if / when / unless\nstudent: Ah! Ok!\nteacher: When I come home, I will watch a movie\nteacher: (joking, no one is away from home anymore!)\nstudent: haha\nteacher: Unless he makes dinner, I will have to do it\nteacher: Well, that's not true, lots of people work away from home.\nteacher: just not us\nstudent: yes!\nstudent: Unless he makes dinner, I will have to do it\nstudent: I'm not sure about the meaning\nteacher: Do you remember 'unless'? unless = if not\nteacher: If he doesn't make dinner, I will have to do it\nteacher: Unless he makes dinner, I will have to do it\nstudent: Ok!

Founded!\nteacher: I see, yes\nstudent: There is an interesting movie about it\nstudent: Ok, interesting for me\nteacher: Yes, like the American 'founding fathers', who founded the nation with their laws and independence from Britain\nteacher: like Washington\nstudent: I'm not sure about other people )\nteacher: about Selfridges?\nstudent: Yes!\nstudent: It is like a documentary\nstudent: Secrets of Selfridges\nteacher: Is it a very old shop then?\nstudent: I think so\nteacher: I've got to check it out.\nstudent: Ok\nstudent: I've checked\nstudent: it was founded in 1090\nstudent: Sorry\nstudent: 1909.0\nteacher: Ok, but you haven't got your order from them!

I've missed the word\nstudent: Ok\nstudent: And you don't have to pay the UK VAT\nteacher: Sounds like a brilliant option.

Or haven't got / haven't received\nteacher: embrace it, embrace it :)))\nstudent: ok ))\nteacher: another one product': another actually means 'one other', so you don't need the word 'one'\nstudent: ok!\nteacher: It\u2019s quite a long time from the date I\u2019ve ordered it\nteacher: you're then giving a date when you ordered it, we know when it happened\nteacher: which means... the date I ......\nstudent: Should I make a phrase?\nteacher: yes, please, can you finish the sentence? the date I ......\nstudent: the date I've ordered it is June 15, 2022\nteacher: Ah, what I'm trying to say is, when you have a specific time in the past, you need Past Simple, not present perfect\nstudent: ok\nteacher: Ok? And you can actually use present perfect in the first part of the sentence\nstudent: the date I ordered\nstudent: ?\nteacher: It's been quite a long time since the date I ordered it\nteacher: Yes, definitely\nstudent: The date I've ordered it was June 15, 2022\nstudent: or like that?\nteacher: That could be a separate sentence, yes, but you still need 'I ordered', not 'I've ordered'\nstudent: Ah! Sorry! I haven't caught the idea\nstudent: ok! I see now\nteacher: Sorry, I should have explained it better!\nteacher: Sure\nstudent: it's clear thank you!\nteacher: Ok, a quick change to the last sentence\nteacher: Can I have the information when are you going to send me the second part of my order?\nteacher: Can I have the information as to when you are going to send me the second part of my order?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: You need to swap 'are' and 'you'\nstudent: because of as to\nstudent: ?\nteacher: because of 'can I have the information'\nstudent: Ah! I see now\nstudent: Thank you\nteacher: When are you going to send me the second part of my order?\nstudent: Sure!\nstudent: Ok! It's clear! )\nstudent: Sorry\nteacher: A question on its own (a bit too straightforward)\nstudent: It's Friday\nteacher: but then you add 'Can I have the information as to'\nteacher: which sounds much nicer, I agree with you\nstudent: My thoughts aren't fast )\nteacher: but after that you need a different word order\nstudent: I see\nteacher: Can I have the information as to when YOU ARE...\nstudent: Ok!\nteacher: We will look at reported speech and word order another time, I'll make a note\nteacher: Ok, have a lovely weekend!\nstudent: You too\nstudent: thank you\nstudent: )\nteacher: Thank you :)\nstudent: bye! )\nteacher: Could you close this programme please?

We're under another lockdown in the UK because the corona situation has got pretty bad.

How was your holiday? And how is online schooling?\nstudent: online is nice\nstudent: I love it\nteacher: Yes, I remember that you prefer it, so I thought you must be pleased\nstudent: The holiday was cool, but a bit boring sometimes\nteacher: What did you do on holiday\nteacher: ?\nstudent: I visited my grandma and my friends\nstudent: also I went shopping\nteacher: Sounds nice\nteacher: Ok, sadly, I have weird times I can offer you for the next week. Could you have a look and say if any of them are good for you?\nteacher: I've got 10 am on Tuesday and 5.30 pm on Wednesday\nteacher: What do you think?\nstudent: at 10 am I have my school and at 5.30 pm it is my Lingua Nueva lesson\nteacher: Oh no, I'm sorry, we'll have to cancel classes next week again! But I'll email you about the week after, ok?\nstudent: I think you should better text me in Skype\nteacher: Oh yes, thanks for reminding me, Skype, yes\nteacher: Are your Lingua Nueva lessons online too?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Do you prefer them online or do you like actually going to Lingua Nueva?\nstudent: I don't really care\nstudent: like at Lingua Nueva they are the same\nteacher: what do you mean?\nstudent: online and offline\nteacher: Ah, I see, they are the same\nteacher: Ok, I thought we could talk about one of my favourite subjects to learn about today\nteacher: the brain and how it works!\nteacher: Do you like to learn about the human brain?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Maybe you've talked about it at school? or some cool stuff you read?\nteacher: I mean, I'm very excited by this subject and I like to read about the brain, listen to TED talks about it etc.\nteacher: What about you?\nstudent: I remember a paragraph about our brain from our English book from last year\nteacher: Ok, what did it say?\nstudent: I don't really remember)\nteacher: Fair enough :)\nteacher: Ok, you know that a brain grows and develops. At what age do you thing the brain is fully formed?\nstudent: about 18\nstudent: that's why we can go to off-licence shops at this age\nstudent: hehe\nteacher: Hahaha)))))\nteacher: The brain is fully formed, that's it, start drinking!\nteacher: So you think yours is still in the process of developing?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Oh goodness, it's your birthday very soon, isn't it?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Yaay! How old will you be? 42?\nstudent: how do you know?)\nteacher: You told me before\nstudent: 42\nteacher: Oh, you're 42 now? I thought you were 42 :)\nteacher: Are you excited about your birthday?\nstudent: not really\nteacher: Why not?\nstudent: because of the lockdown\nteacher: Ok, can you give me a nice big sentence, please?\nstudent: I am not excited about my birthday because of the lockdown\nteacher: I see, what a shame. I hope you will still have some fun!\nteacher: You're becoming a real teenager!\nstudent: thank you\nteacher: Do you think teenagers are different from adults? and younger children? In terms of how their brains work\nstudent: I think yes, because teenagers are not children anymore, but they are not adults, and people sometimes think about them as children and sometimes as adults\nteacher: Yes, it's an interesting time in-between, you're right!\nteacher: The video (a cartoon) I prepared for you today is on how a teenager's brain is different\nteacher: Just a bit of vocabulary before we start\nteacher: the science of the brain and the nervous system is called...\nteacher: neuroscience\nteacher: \u02ccnj\u028a\u0259.r\u0259\u028a\u02c8sa\u026a\u0259ns\nteacher: Ok?\nteacher: Which school subject do you think you will have bits of neuroscience in?\nstudent: biology\nteacher: Exactly, it's part of human biology\nteacher: and psychology!\nteacher: Ok, and you know the brain has two parts? like two halves\nteacher: These two halves are called hemispheres\nstudent: hi\nstudent: sorry\nteacher: Hi Sophia Smith, connection problems?\nstudent: yeah\nstudent: I am okay now\nteacher: Ok, sure\nteacher: Our brains have two hemispheres, the right one and the left one\nteacher: And another thing that has hemispheres is our planet!\nteacher: The Northern one and the ....?\nstudent: Southern\nteacher: exactly\nteacher: And also, brains are divided into smaller parts called lobes\nteacher: for example, a frontal lobe is at the front of the brain, behind our foreheads\nteacher: Ok, and the last word is 'to evolve'\nteacher: #ERROR!\nteacher: for example, scientists believe that humans evolved from primates\nteacher: and I bet you know the noun for 'evolve'??\nstudent: evolution\nteacher: absolutely\nteacher: Ok, I'm goint to send you a link to the video on skype. Can you watch and say how a teenager's brain is different, please?\nstudent: okay\nstudent: this content isn't available in my region\nstudent: I can read the transcript\nstudent: hey?\nteacher: Oh no, what a shame! Yes please, can you read the transcript?\nstudent: the frontal lobe in teenagers' brains isn't fully developed and they also have a high level of dopamine\nstudent: e\nteacher: Yes, what does it mean in terms of how they experience life?\nstudent: Sometimes teenagers can feel out of control. Dopamine motivates us to do things, to feel interested in life, to seek out new experiences\nteacher: Yes, great! It's definitely a time to feel big emotions and do new things!\nteacher: Ok, lovely! I hope you will have a great birthday even though you can't see your friends!\nteacher: And I'll message you about our next class\nstudent: okay, thank you for the lesson, bye!\nteacher: Bye Sophia Smith :)",
    "student: Hello!\nteacher: Hi Emma Johnson!\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: I'm fine. Thank you\nstudent: How are you?\nteacher: Good, thank you!\nteacher: Are you at home or at work?\nstudent: I'm at work\nstudent: I had a couple of lessons today\nteacher: Nice! English, Russian or Ukrainian?\nstudent: It's really cold now in Ukraine.\nteacher: Oh yes, I've heard! Are you enjoying the cold spell?\nstudent: Russian. One with a German student, another one with an American\nteacher: Very cool!\nstudent: I do, actually. Still, I'm a little worried about walking back home from school\nstudent: Is it cold in Britain?\nteacher: Is it really slippery?\nstudent: No. Just cold. I fear that I'm going to freeze\nteacher: Well, it's actually a bit warmer now, it was pretty bitter a couple of days ago. Maybe -3 at night and around +3 during the day. Lots of places got some beautiful snow but not us, sadly\nstudent: Without snow it's no fun at all\nteacher: No! But it's the downside of the fact that we're in a quite a mild area, which I do enjoy!\nstudent: Can I leave 15 min early today if you don't mind?\nteacher: Yes, of course! Let's jump right in in this case\nstudent: Oh, sure\nteacher: I was going to invite you to enter the lion's den of C2 writing with me :)\nstudent: Oh no\nstudent: Maybe more tests :))))))))))\nteacher: I thought if we do a bit of planning and brainstorming for that 'important decision' task, it will be easy for you to write it up later on\nstudent: I suck at writing\nteacher: Go on, it'll be fun!\nteacher: Well, that might be overpromising, actually :)))\nteacher: But we can do it!\nstudent: haha\nstudent: Let's do some tests\nstudent: pleeease\nstudent: And I'll try to write\nstudent: Prepare it for next week\nteacher: Are you sure? Ok, as you say!\nteacher: Ok, your favourite then, key word transformation\nstudent: YASS\nstudent: Thank you\nteacher: One second\nstudent: sure\nteacher: Ok, you've got to use 3-8 words for each gap and keep the meaning as close to the original as possible\nstudent: Got it\nteacher: The mistake in the accounts was not noticed until the figures were re-checked.\nteacher: Key word: light\nteacher: The mistake in the accounts only ........................................ the figures were re-checked.\nstudent: no clue\nstudent: something to do with 'highlight'?\nteacher: Ah, no, it's the expression 'come to light'\nteacher: came to light when / after / once'\nstudent: ah\nstudent: well. I knew the phrase but there was no way I was going to remember it )))\nteacher: A good expression for reporting on police investigation in local news)))\nstudent: My head is so heavy today.. for whatever reason\nstudent: Maybe it's these weather changes\nstudent: these\nteacher: Yes, it's so extreme! Is it still around -15?\nstudent: today it's - 15 in 2 days it's +3\nteacher: Oh wow, the change indeed! In the UK, it would have been a state of emergency with the government telling people not to leave their houses\nstudent: In Ukraine it's the norm )\nstudent: with icicles falling on your head\nteacher: Yes, dangerous stuff!\nteacher: Ok, a nice and easy one\nteacher: I had no problems at all during my trip to France.\nteacher: key word: plan\nteacher: Everything ........................................ during my trip to France.\nstudent: went according to plan\nteacher: yes, exactly :)\nteacher: The heavy downpour brought their picnic to an abrupt end.\nteacher: key word: cut\nteacher: They had to ........................................ because of the heavy downpour.\nstudent: cut their picnic short\nteacher: yes, sure!\nteacher: The reforms will not succeed unless they are carefully planned.\nteacher: key word: crucial\nteacher: Careful ........................................ of the reforms.\nstudent: planning is crucial for the success\nteacher: Yes, well done!\nteacher: crucial 'to' is the first option, actually, but 'for' is ok too\nstudent: I hesitated with 'the' before 'success'\nstudent: Got it\nteacher: I see, I would say it's 'the' because we have 'of the reforms'\nteacher: Hard work is crucial to success. (general advice)\nstudent: Yes! An of-phrase\nteacher: vs. the success of the reforms\nteacher: yes!\nstudent: Great\nteacher: Ok, next one\nteacher: They think that Helen's brother stole the money.\nteacher: suspected\nteacher: Helen's brother __________the money.\nstudent: is suspected of having stolen\nteacher: Yes!\nteacher: I feel completely exhausted when I've listened to Marion for half-an-hour.\nteacher: key word: leaves\nteacher: Half-an-hour ........................................ completely exhausted.\nstudent: of listening to Marion leaves me\nteacher: Yes, absolutely\nstudent: yay\nteacher: :))\nteacher: As you can see, C2 loves testing this 'BBC' language, I would say\nstudent: Right\nteacher: with lots of cliches used by politicians for example\nstudent: I've noticed it too\nteacher: like ' careful planning is crucial to ....' and stuff like that\nteacher: So, if you wanted, exposing yourself to things like BBC news could be very helpful. But obviously, the news can be very depressing these days, so I can't recommend this without certain reservations :)\nstudent: They probably think..'Hey, it's the BBC. How more complicated can it get?'\nteacher: How do you like to get your news? (a beloved C2 and IELTS question)\nteacher: Exactly\nstudent: All the important news I can either hear from my husband or from my Facebook feed\nstudent: or read from my FB feed\nstudent: I never watch news on TV\nstudent: My husband reads Twitter and Reddit every morning\nteacher: Sorry, it's still me! The chatroom froze for me\nstudent: No worries\nstudent: I can copy my replies if you want\nteacher: No, I've got them!\nteacher: I was just waiting to see if you say something else\nstudent: and then your doppelg\u00e4nger came\nteacher: I know, it's a bit weird with this chatroom :)\nteacher: Ok, sure!\nteacher: Do you use Google news at all?\nstudent: Almost never. Unless it's some really major news or the news I'm really excited about\nstudent: What is your channel of preference?\nteacher: That's probably a good approach! I'm trying to break up with Google news because it's tailored to me, and I don't want the news to be tailored to me if you know what I mean. This information bubble is something to be very cautious about\nteacher: Well, like yourself, I never watch news on TV because we haven't got 'conventional TV', only streaming services\nstudent: Yes. I know exactly what you mean\nstudent: The ads become tailored as well\nteacher: In the UK, the main sources of news are quite clearly branded as leaning to the left or to the right\nstudent: sad\nteacher: I read The Guardian, which is very left-leaning. The Telegraph is the opposite. The BBC is supposed to be in the middle\nteacher: Another one is the Independent, which positions itself, well, as an independent source, but it's owned by a Russian oligarch, so I steer clear\nstudent: Do you have a subscription?\nstudent: a*\nteacher: No, I read online versions and occasionally donate. My conscience is not clear about not having a subscripton but hey!\nstudent: I read the Economist sometimes\nstudent: I remembered\nteacher: Ok, I've got to let you go! Are you driving or walking?\nstudent: There's a limit of what you can read for free though\nstudent: Walking\nstudent: Right. I have to go\nstudent: Sorry for such a short conversation\nteacher: Yes, hope you'll get home safe!\nstudent: Would you mind reminding me where I can look up the Writing Task?\nteacher: No problem at all, thanks for contributing to the project despite facing your many challenges!\nteacher: I'll email it to you, ok?\nstudent: Perfect! Thank you!!\nstudent: Have a great day\nteacher: Lovely, you too, hope you'll be home soon!\nstudent: Thanks! I'll try to run to keep myself warm\nstudent: haha\nstudent: Bye\nteacher: Bye! :)",
    "student: Hi Ms. Rodriguez!\nteacher: Morning!\nteacher: How are you? Is it still arctic in Kyiv?\nstudent: Sorry for that ))\nstudent: I'm ok\nstudent: Yes, it's still frosty here\nteacher: Are you still enjoying it? Or is it a bit extreme?\nstudent: -16 now\nteacher: Goodness!!\nstudent: And the day after tomorrow it will be 0\nstudent: crazy weather!\nteacher: Yes, Samantha Jones told me yesterday that it was about to change\nstudent: about to change?\nteacher: If something is about to happen, it's going to happen very soon\nstudent: ahh!\nstudent: I see now\nteacher: For example, we're about to be out of the lockdown\nteacher: Oh no, I'm joking, we are not!\nstudent: Yesterday we even decided with the nanny not to take Emma for a walk\nstudent: hahaha\nstudent: I like the joke\nteacher: Well, if it was -16 in the UK, the government would tell everyone to stay at home\nstudent: You seem like a person with a positive view of the lockdown situation )\nteacher: Well, I complain, but I do understand that it's necessary! And we're very lucky to be able to work and not lose our income\nteacher: You know, if we worked at a restaurant or hotel or hairdresser's, it would be very different\nstudent: Usually in Ukraine the government tells children to stay at home when it's less than -20 I think\nteacher: Also, Ethan loves the lockdown :))\nteacher: Ha, yes, very sensible. It would be -5 in the UK)))\nstudent: Sure! About the income\nteacher: And we're very lucky that it's all happening when he is so young. If he ____ a teenager and couldn't see his friends, it ____ _____ more difficult\nstudent: -5? Is it a joke? )\nteacher: Nope, not a joke. When it's below zero, the government issues warnings to be careful and not go out unless necessary\nstudent: If he was a teenager and couldn't see his friends, it would be more difficult\nteacher: Yes, exactly! Second conditional, right? Unreal present\nstudent: Wow! Interesting! But why? 0 is not dangerous for health for example\nstudent: Unreal present  - sure!\nteacher: Well, next time we have a frosty day, I'll show you a warning\nteacher: You might have to wait a few years :))\nstudent: )))\nstudent: haha\nstudent: Actually I don't feel well and I think It's because of the weather\nteacher: The health minister said yesterday that people shouldn't book holidays abroad this year because the situation is so uncertain. He said he booked a holiday in Cornwall, and now I want to do the same :) I might spend the evening looking at cottages in Cornwall\nstudent: I think the body has to spend lots of energy when it's frosty\nteacher: Oh really? Sorry to hear that! Again, Samantha Jones said the same thing last night, she wasn't feeling well\nteacher: Yes, I completely agree with you!! I have this theory that in the summer our bodies don't have to work so hard to keep us warm and we feel better. But you don't like hot weather either!\nstudent: I even had a cardiogram yesterday for my cardiologist\nteacher: What did they say?\nstudent: She said that the cardiogram was ok. But you know I had some problems with my heart so I try to check it if I feel unwell\nstudent: I felt last night like I'd had several cups of coffee\nteacher: I didn't know that, no. It's good news that it was ok!\nstudent: you know when the heart beats too fast\nteacher: Oh, like your heart rate was too high? Yes, I see!\nstudent: She (propisala) some pills to normalize the beat\nteacher: She prescribed some pills to you\nteacher: I see! Did she give any general advice? You should exercise / not exercise etc.\nstudent: no, but I think if it's not something unusual I can do yoga and pilates from this Friday\nteacher: Sure, I hope you feel better very soon!\nstudent: But I'm going to miss the strength training tomorrow\nstudent: I feel better now, thank you\nstudent: I think it will be completely ok when the temperature is around 0 )\nteacher: Yes, this is very extreme weather you're having!\nstudent: When your government would be telling everybody to be at home ))\nteacher: When I tell people here that in Ukraine 0 degrees is warm and you can go out without a hat, they find it hard to believe\nstudent: haha it's interesting )\nteacher: Yes, it's completely different\nstudent: I had a student from UAE\nstudent: He is originally Syrian\nteacher: Oh, I bet they couldn't imagine it!\nstudent: Syrian\nstudent: So even +10 is cold for him )\nstudent: I have a funny story for you )\nstudent: About a man and a present for a toddler )\nteacher: Go on!\nstudent: We have friends who are living in France\nteacher: Yes, Syrian is a good correction\nstudent: Maybe you remember )\nteacher: We have ___ friend who ____ living in France :)\nstudent: sorry friends\nteacher: Are, ok!\nstudent: just typo\nstudent: ok\nteacher: no worries, go on\nstudent: The girl is my yoga teacher\nstudent: ok and they've sent us a present for Christmas\nteacher: Ah, ok!\nstudent: Chocolate, cheese and other stuff\nteacher: Nice!\nstudent: And we bought something like that for them\nstudent: Sweets, caviar etc\nstudent: But they have a daughter. She is 1 year yonger than Emma\nstudent: So she is about 2,5 years old now\nstudent: And David decided to buy something special for her (in spite of the fact that they didn't send us a special gift for Emma ))))\nstudent: ok and he's ordered a painting kit for her but he didn't have enough time to pick it up and sent the parcel without the kit\nstudent: But yesterday he decided to pick up the kit for Emma because it had already been paid for and he didn't want to lose the money\nstudent: So he brought the kit\nstudent: Ok!\nstudent: It's for 7+ children ))\nteacher: Oh no! Emma will grow into it :)\nstudent: but you know\nstudent: we had to open it\nstudent: )))\nteacher: Of course you did!\nstudent: It's ok, we can do it together\nstudent: There is a (Holst) with a picture and some numbers\nteacher: holst = canvas\nteacher: Ah, painting by numbers? Yes, I know what you mean\nstudent: and there are acrylic paints with numbers on them\nteacher: Acrylic paints are definitely not for children because they are not washable!\nstudent: Yes! It's nice! We can do it together. But I can imagine if we had sent it to the 2,5 years old toddler\nstudent: )))))\nstudent: The parents would be very surprised )\nteacher: Yes, it's a good job you didn't. If you had sent it, they wouldn't have known what to do with it!\nstudent: Ah! Ok! It's about the past\nteacher: See, this is an unreal situation in the past. Because you didn't send the kit\nteacher: Exactly\nteacher: I was just sitting here waiting to give you more grammar work)))\nstudent: past perfect and would have + V3\nteacher: If / Unless + had + V3, would have + V3\nstudent: hahaha\nteacher: exactly, past perfect\nteacher: after if\nteacher: If I had left 10 minutes earlier, I wouldn't have been late\nstudent: Ok! I see!\nteacher: If I had known that his dog had died, I wouldn't have asked about it\nteacher: and other regrets :)\nstudent: But not just regrets\nstudent: !\nteacher: No, of course not\nstudent: )\nstudent: I mean our case\nteacher: I'm trying to think of something that's not a regret))\nteacher: Yes, that was a lucky escape!\nteacher: If the lion had been hungry, he would have eaten me :)\nteacher: or something like that\nstudent: If we had sent the kit, it would have been worse )\nstudent: hahaha\nstudent: about the lion )\nteacher: it would have been worse, yes\nstudent: the lion! )\nteacher: the lion, yes))\nstudent: Ah\nstudent: have\nstudent: I see\nteacher: Many people in the UK think that if the government had introduced a strict lockdwon sooner, we wouldn't have had the second wave\nteacher: Sorry, I can't help covid examples))\nstudent: ))\nteacher: We can actually mix the conditionals now. The government didn't introduce a lockdown sooner (in the past). We're having a second wave (now)\nteacher: Which is part third conditional, part second\nteacher: If the government had introduced a strict lockdown sooner, we wouldn't have a second way\nteacher: wouldn't have = unreal present\nteacher: These are called mixed conditionals\nstudent: I know\nstudent: I hate it\nstudent: Sorry ))\nteacher: Haha, well, they are very logical\nstudent: ok\nstudent: ok\nstudent: I'll try to love them )\nteacher: If I hadn't learned English, I woulnd't be an English teacher now\nteacher: If I hadn't married an Englishman, I wouldn't be living in the UK now\nteacher: And so on :)\nteacher: Can you give me an example, please?\nstudent: I see ) It's logical you are right )\nstudent: If I hadn't decided to open a school I would still be a lawyer now\nteacher: Exactly!\nstudent: Oh!\nteacher: Are you writing something else? Or waiting for me?\nstudent: Ah! I'm waiting\nstudent: waiting\nstudent: sorry )\nteacher: Ah, sorry! I never know in this chat!\nstudent: One more?\nteacher: If you want to!\nstudent: ok!\nteacher: Oh, have you heard from Selfridges?\nstudent: If we hadn't moved to the new flat we would live in the old one )\nteacher: Yes, exactly. If you hadn't moveD\nteacher: By the way, a couple of things from before\nteacher: Our friends ____ us a present for Christmas (action in the past)\nstudent: Oh! Yes! They wrote me that they would investigate )\nstudent: Our friends sent us a present for Christmas (action in the past)\nteacher: Yes, you told me, but I thought maybe they found out something\nteacher: Yes, absolutely\nstudent: Ah! Still not!\nteacher: David ordered / has ordered a painting kit (also in the past)\nstudent: just ordered?\nteacher: Yes, just ordered. Because you're telling the whole story in the past, so everything can be past simple / past continuous\nstudent: I see\nteacher: Past perfect if you really want to :)) but not present perfect\nteacher: because present perfect is about the present\nstudent: Ah! Ok! Thank you )\nteacher: Don't worry, you'll get more comfortable with these tenses!\nstudent: maybe ))\nteacher: And I'll send you some homework for the third + mixed conditionals\nstudent: thank you!\nteacher: And we're speaking again on Friday, right?\nstudent: Yes!\nteacher: Yes, lovely!\nteacher: Have a good day, thank you! :)\nstudent: you too! Thank you! bye! )",
    "student: Hi!\nteacher: Hi Alexandra!\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: Fine thank you :) How about you?\nteacher: All good, thanks! It's a nice mild day today\nstudent: Really? Here it still is cold...and this year it has snowed for at least five times so far...\nteacher: Yes, I thought it might be cold in Austria because my students in Kyiv are having a really cold spell, down to -18\nteacher: It's snowed in the UK too! But not in East Anglia where we live, sadly. We're in a very mild bit of the country\nteacher: Well, not as mild as the south, but still, by the time any storms from the Atlantic get here, they've lost most of their power\nstudent: I see...well, they tell me that the weather in Graz is usually milder, but this year is a bit different I guess..\nteacher: Is it your first in Graz? I've just realized I've assumed you've lived in Austria for a while\nstudent: Well, I arrived here at the end of 2019, so this is my second winter...indeed the first one was much milder\nstudent: But 2 winters isn't a statistically significant sample...\nteacher: Fair enough, it's nice to talk to a scientist :)\nteacher: Have you had a chance to revisit collocations in between classes?\nstudent: Haha...yes, sorry, I am the kind of person who has answered 'yes' to the waiter asking 'Did you decide what to eat?'\nstudent: Yes, I have read the first page (and done the 3 little exercises in between) and done the first exercise of the practice\nteacher: That's ok, I've got a friend who's answered 'yes' to 'Is there a doctor on the plane?'. He's got a PhD in plant genetics\nteacher: Ok, sure. Have you got any questions? Have you checked your answers? There's a key at the end, I forgot to tell you!\nstudent: Haha...I am guessing they meant another kind of doctor.\nstudent: Oh no I haven't checked\nteacher: Were there any expressions that surprised you / you liked particularly?\nstudent: Checking it now, one second...yes, I was unsure about a few, looks like I didn't answer to all well, just let me finish checking so I have the whole list\nteacher: Sure, no rush\nstudent: So, I am looking at the 2nd exercise in between the explanation...I didn't know timing could be 'immaculate'\nteacher: Yes, as well as perfect\nstudent: Indeed, I knew only the expression 'perfect timing'\nstudent: immaculate timing' really surprised me, is it more literary or old-fashioned?\nteacher: Hmm, it's lower frequency, but still quite modern for now, I would say\nstudent: Okay, then I'll try to remember it...and to be in class with immaculate timing from now on ;)\nteacher: You know, like reinforcement in superhero / adventure films. They always arrive with immaculate timing\nstudent: Okay, then maybe I have never noticed the expression!\nstudent: Then the second mistake was 'Nothing you say will make a scrap of difference to my decision'...I chose 'grain', but was really unsure...\nteacher: Hmm, I'm thinking now whether 'immaculate timing' can be used to refer to punctuality\nteacher: Yes, I see. a grain of truth / a grain of wisdom\nteacher: There isn't a logic to it, I'm afraid.\nstudent: Oh, so immaculate timing isn't punctuality but rather the idea to arrive at just the right moment...okay\nstudent: If 'perfect timing' has the same meaning then the problem is that I am slightly misusing it, meaning punctuality\nteacher: Yes, it's about something happening at just the right moment. If I finish work and come downstairs just as my husband's prepared dinner, he'll often say, 'Perfect timing!'\nstudent: instead of 'the right time'\nstudent: Okay!\nstudent: The grammar explanation says there is often no reason behind collocations so we'll accept them for what they are\nteacher: Yes, and it also refers to situations when you're estimating time to do something. She was half an hour late because she thought the jouney would take no more than an hour. Her timing was off\nteacher: Yes, definitely.\nteacher: In gardening, timing is very important. Last year, my seed sowing timing was a bit off, but it's something I'm trying to get right this year\nteacher: Things like that!\nstudent: You should do your seed sowing with immaculate timing!\nstudent: Okay, thank you for the explanation :)\nstudent: The other expressions I completed wrongly were 'bumper harvest', 'momentous year' and 'whole-heartedly agree'...to be honest, I wasn't sure about the first two, but for this last one both options sounded to me 'okay'\nteacher: Let me check the options quickly\nstudent: So I was wondering is there is a similar expression which uses 'unconditionally'...maybe 'I unconditionally support everything you said'\nteacher: Ha, I see what they've done here! We can agree unconditionally (when it goes after the verb)\nteacher: but we whole-heartedly agree (before the verb)\nteacher: And of course, love collocates with unconditionally\nstudent: Oh yes, okay...word ordering was the problem! That's hard\nstudent: But now that you wrote it as 'agree unconditionally' it sounds much better!\nteacher: Yes, it is! It's one of those that just sounds right / doesn't sound right, very annoying\nteacher: Yes, exactly!\nteacher: And a 'momentous' year is a year to remember\nteacher: I'm sure it's a Latin thing, isn't it\nteacher: while 'monumental' means very big, like a monumental task\nteacher: or a monumental waste of time\nstudent: monumental' is a word I immediately recognized...to be honest 'momentous' isn't similar to any word I know in Italian or Latin...and it looks like it actually comes from French\nstudent: (but the 'ous' ending does make it sound Latin, indeed)\nteacher: What about memento mori?\nstudent: that's a Latin saying\nteacher: Yes, that's where momentous comes from! From memento\nteacher: as in 'something to remember'\nstudent: Indeed...okay, thanks!\nteacher: There's even a noun in English, a memento\nteacher: For example, I always bring seashells from a beach I visit, as a memento\nteacher: same as a souvenir, but souvenir is French and memento is Latin\nteacher: Poor English had to borrow all its sentimental words!\nstudent: Haha...it looks like that's the case\nteacher: :)))\nstudent: Indeed for 'memento' English didn't even bother to change the word...'this pen is a memento from my first year of high school'\nteacher: Exactly!\nstudent: should I use 'from' or 'of' in that sentence? I was in doubt...\nteacher: I think either is fine, to be honest\nteacher: I've prepared something I hope you'll find interesting for today, let's see how much of it we'll have the time for\nstudent: Okay...I guess that studying German is making me super wary about which prepositions I use..\nstudent: Okay, let's see!\nteacher: Well, it can be quite rigorous in English in terms of prepositions, but not in this case I think. A memento of what? or a memento from when?\nteacher: I'm always on the lookout for some English idioms and phrasal verbs for you that come from natural speech rather than from a book, and I thought a good source would be comments on the Internet. I looked up some comments on Youtube for one Trump's latest speeches and ran away in dismay. Don't worry, we aren't going to look at those!\nstudent: Haha...YouTube comments can be dangerous...\nteacher: Then I went to the Guardian website and saw there 'most commented on' article. The article is indeed on something that British people think about a lot (too much in my opinion), classes\nteacher: As in working class, middle class and upper class\nteacher: Do people in Italy think about it a lot?\nteacher: *their\nstudent: I wouldn't say they think a lot about it, but it certainly is a topic I have heard about before...but I guess that it is different in England, since you also have the nobility, which, I believe, makes it more relevant\nstudent: But, from time to time, Italian newspapers do talk about classes...but I wouldn't say it has been recently on the news...\nteacher: Oh yes, class is a very important part of the culture here. The nobility are obviously upper class, and that's probably the only hard distinction. No matter how much someone might socially climb, they will never become upper class unless they were born into it\nstudent: Indeed...I would describe this situation as 'anachronistic', but then...Italian society has its issues too..\nteacher: I think the mind of an English person is always scanning for class as a social identifier. The distinction between the working and middle class very much depends on the definition of them\nteacher: But there is much more social mobility between them. Someone could be born in a working class family, but go to a university and land a middle class job\nteacher: Yes, and people will say, 'I'm from working class background' and things like that\nstudent: Haha, I see...no that's an expression I'd never use\nstudent: even though that would probably apply to my case\nteacher: This article was actually looking at people who misidentified themselves as working class while working as solicitors and real estate agents, for example\nteacher: Didn't you say your father was a doctor?\nstudent: Indeed\nstudent: that wouldn't be considered middle class?\nteacher: That's very middle class :)\nteacher: Well, one of the definitions is, if it's manual work, it's working class, and if it's office work and / or you had to go to university to do it, it's middle class\nstudent: And he studied in the British school system, so he probably also has the right aplomb\nteacher: Oh really? Did he attend a boarding school?\nstudent: No, but he lived in South Africa during his youth and studied there\nteacher: I see, yes, makes sense!\nteacher: The money doesn't necessarily come into this division. A plumber can do much better financially than a person in a more middle class employment\nstudent: Haha...that's so true\nstudent: Sorry, I mean...I understand that the money isn't that important...\nteacher: I've realized I've totally started to think in terms of class after a 8 years with my husband. Ah, I don't like it!\nteacher: *sorry, 8 years, no article\nstudent: I see...well, if it is so important for the English Society then this isn't too surprising...\nstudent: but at least you can remember when you didn't think much about your class ;)\nstudent: I believe that the only way to understand certain things is to live in other countries and experience other cultures...I guess this could be an example\nteacher: Yes! true!\nteacher: Ok, just a couple of things from the comment section, which as you can imagine was so rich!\nteacher: and we can continue next time\nstudent: Okay!\nteacher: So this particular comment starts with, 'I predict this will open a right can of worms'\nteacher: Do you know the idiom they are using here?  with 'right' as an intensifier\nstudent: I think I have seen it before, but I am not so sure...\nstudent: I am guessing it means to stir a lot of animosity towards what he/she is writing\nteacher: You can probably guess what 'to open a can of worms' means\nteacher: Yes, this person expects there will be a lot of extreme opinions and disagreement, and animosity as you say\nstudent: I see....interesting, and indeed very useful when writing comments on the internet\nteacher: A good everyday expression, people use the whole phrase or sometimes just the 'can of worms' bit\nteacher: Chatroom's acting up, sorry!\nstudent: No problem\nteacher: Ok, how about I send you the article to read if you're curious, and we can continue with some fun expressions from the comments next time?\nstudent: Okay, sounds great!\nteacher: And if you feel like doing some writing on any subject, we can do that and go back to our writing-editing too\nstudent: Thank you for your time then...and see you next week!\nstudent: Okay!\nteacher: Great, I'll email you about the time of the next class by the end of the week, ok/\nteacher: /\nteacher: ?\nteacher: Are there any days that won't suit you?\nstudent: Same as this time: no Monday, no Wednesday\nteacher: Got you, great. Have a nice day!\nstudent: You too!",
    "teacher: Hi Sophia Smith! Is it you?\nstudent: Hi! It is me )\nstudent: How are you Ms. Rodriguez?\nteacher: Good!\nteacher: I'm ok, thank you\nteacher: And you?\nstudent: How is the lockdown?\nstudent: How long is it going to be?\nstudent: I'm ok, thank you!\nstudent: Will try my yoga today after the lesson\nteacher: Well, the government just said that schools will probably go back by April, maybe a little earlier in the areas where infectin rates are lower\nteacher: It's not a sprint, it's a marathon!\nteacher: Lovely, are you at work? How's your lockdown going?\nstudent: Sure! It's true!\nstudent: I'm at home now\nstudent: I've decided to have the chat and the yoga (the?) at home and then I'm going to work\nteacher: Yes, the chat and the yoga, because you're talking about your classes that both know about\nstudent: I have to work on our rent agreement today and then I have a lesson with my French student\nstudent: Yes, the chat and the yoga! - Wow! I did it )\nteacher: I like yoga (in general). The yoga was difficult yesterday (the class I did yesterday)\nstudent: I see. Thank you!\nteacher: I see! I guess you look after all legal matters at school?\nstudent: Yes! It seems like we don't need another lawyer )\nteacher: I bet :)) are you going to renew your rent agreement? or are you switching to online work?\nstudent: Just to renew. Actually it's not a new agreement, it's a special document where we agree to extend the contract\nstudent: In Ukrainian it's 'dodatkova ugoda')\nstudent: Like an additional agreement\nteacher: Ok, to prolong the contract\nstudent: Ah, sorry. So we need to prolong the contract\nteacher: Yes, it makes sense. Sorry, actually 'to extend the contract'\nteacher: to extend the contract until July, for example\nstudent: Aha! So extend the contract\nstudent: Ok! So we need to extend the contract until August 2021\nteacher: Yes, that's right! The noun is 'extension'\nstudent: an extension of the contract?\nstudent: Actually\nteacher: yes, an extension of the contract\nstudent: Is there a difference between an agreement and a contract? What do you think?\nteacher: Hmm, there's a difference in how they're used. For example, an employee has a contract with an employer, with all the information about salary, rights and duties etc.\nstudent: I see\nteacher: But it's an agreement when you're renting, you're right. A rental agreement\nstudent: it's interesting\nteacher: And the same when you have a mortgage, a mortgage agreement\nteacher: If two countries agree to cooperate in some way, it's a deal\nteacher: like the Brexit deal\nstudent: Because we have 'dogovor' and 'contract' and actually it's the same\nteacher: a trade deal, for example\nteacher: Yes, dogovor is Russian / Ukrainian and contract is borrowed, but they mean the same, don't they?\nstudent: yes. I mean that it doesn't matter what to call the document. It doesn't change the essence\nteacher: Yes, exactly\nteacher: Have you had a chance to practise third and mixed conditionals?\nteacher: Have you got any questions?\nstudent: Oh, sorry but I didn't\nteacher: No worries! Let's have a look together, one moment\nstudent: Ok!\nteacher: Here's a football example!\nteacher: If he _____ the penalty, we would have won Saturday's game. (the verb is 'score')\nstudent: ok\nstudent: ok\nstudent: If he had scored the penalty, we would have won Saturday's game.\nteacher: Yes, well done!\nteacher: I _____ a cake this morning if I'd known you were coming. (buy)\nstudent: I would have bought a cake this morning if I'd known you were coming.\nteacher: Correct! :)\nteacher: If I _____ so much cheese last night, I wouldn't feel terrible now. (eat)\nstudent: It is mixed, isn't it?\nteacher: Yes, exactly!\nstudent: ok\nstudent: If I wou\nstudent: sorry\nstudent: If I hadn't eaten so much cheese last night, I wouldn't feel terrible now.\nteacher: Yes, very well done :)\nteacher: We _____ late if you hadn't taken such a long time getting ready.\nteacher: another mixed one\nstudent: When I know what I have to do, it's ok\nteacher: sorry, the verb is 'be'\nstudent: But when I start to speak... )\nstudent: ok, next one )\nteacher: We'll practise it some more in a minute, in a freer manner\nstudent: We wouldn't be late if you hadn't taken such a long time getting ready.\nteacher: Yes, absolutely!\nteacher: And one last piece of the puzzle with modals + V3\nteacher: We wouldn't be late if you hadn't takes such a long time getting ready.\nteacher: You should have got ready quicker!\nteacher: I shouldn't have eaten all this cheese last night!\nteacher: I should have bought a cake\nteacher: He should have studied harder, then he wouldn't have failed his exam\nteacher: should + V3 = to talk about what we think was a good idea for people to do in the past (but they didn't do it!)\nstudent: ok\nstudent: I see\nteacher: You know, people love it when you tell them, you should have done this or that :)))\nstudent: haha\nstudent: I know\nstudent: I love it )))\nteacher: but it's fun!))))\nteacher: exactly\nteacher: Ok, I've got a story for you today, to practise talking about unreal situations in the past\nteacher: A lot went wrong in this story :)\nstudent: Oh! Let's try )\nteacher: It's a story about a musician called Antonio. Antonio is in love with Barbara and wants to marry her. He goes to Barbara's father.\nteacher: They all live in a small fisherman's town. Barbara's dad asks Antonio, 'Have you got a boat? If you haven't got a boat, you can't marry my daughter. You can't provide for her'\nteacher: Antonio hasn't got a boat. So he goes to his friend Chris and asks him to lend him his boat. But Chris refuses. He needs this boat for work, he is a fisherman\nteacher: Antonio and Barbara split up. Antonio is upset and asks another girl in the town, Elizabeth, to marry him instead.\nteacher: But Elizabeth says he's still in love with Barbara and refuses him\nstudent: haha ok )\nteacher: As a result, Antonio is unmarried and unhappy. Who do you think is to blame??\nstudent: to blame like who was wrong?\nteacher: Yes, whose fault is it?\nstudent: not a simple story )\nteacher: No, it's a soap opera :)\nstudent: ok the father is to blame\nstudent: )\nteacher: Oh really? Why? )) If he had allowed Antonio and Barbara to get married, ......?\nstudent: If he had allowed Antonio and Barbara to get married, they would have been happy )\nteacher: Yes, happy but poor! :))\nstudent: mixed?\nteacher: Not necessarily, third conditional is absolutely fine!\nteacher: What about Chris?\nstudent: ok!\nstudent: If Chris had borrowed the boat, he would have been a poor man and unhappy too )\nteacher: Yes, he would have lost his work!\nteacher: What about Barbara?\nstudent: can I use the second conditional?\nstudent: With Chris\nteacher: How do you mean?\nstudent: If Chris lent his friend the boat, he would be a poor man and unhappy too\nteacher: Hmmm, let's imagine the whole story is in the past. If it was in present, then yes!\nstudent: Ah! Ok! I see now\nstudent: Ok\nstudent: Barbara\nstudent: If she had been a smart girl, she would have found a job and wouldn't have asked her father about her marriage )\nteacher: Ah, I completely agree with you :))\nteacher: Barbara should have said no to patriarchy and married a poor musician! :))\nstudent: Agree!\nteacher: What about Elizabeth? Do you think she did the right thing?\nstudent: She did what she should have done )\nstudent: I like her )\nteacher: She did what she should\nstudent: Ok! So without do!\nteacher: sorry, she did what she should ___ ____ (in the past)\nstudent: Ah!\nstudent: she did what she should have done\nteacher: Yes, absolutely :)\nteacher: And what about Antonio? :)\nstudent: ok\nstudent: one more question\nteacher: yes, sure\nstudent: Is it right to use should have done if it's real\nstudent: ?\nstudent: She did it\nteacher: Yes, that's right!\nstudent: ok\nstudent: Antonio\nstudent: Antonio shouldn't have asked his friend about the boat and should just have married Barbara\nteacher: secretly?\nstudent: no )\nstudent: Just without her father's approval )\nteacher: Fair enough, I see :))\nstudent: They are quite old-fashioned )\nteacher: See, Antonio is the romantic protagonist here, so he had to have an Italian name :)\nteacher: Yes, definitely old-fashioned!\nstudent: Actually, I heard the stereotype that Italian men are very childish\nstudent: infantile?\nteacher: Lovely, thank you, great work today! You can finish the exercises I sent you last time at home if you have a chance\nstudent: it is better maybe\nteacher: Yes, both childish and infantile are very good words here!\nstudent: I will do! Thank you! Have a good day!\nstudent: Bye! )\nteacher: Thank you! :) Have a good weekend! x\nstudent: you too xx",
    "student: Hi! How are you?\nteacher: Hi Sarah Jones!\nteacher: All good, how are you?\nstudent: me too\nteacher: How was your birthday??\nstudent: fine\nstudent: we had some fun on Saturday\nteacher: Were you able to see your friends? Did you have any nice presents?\nstudent: I celebrated with my friends\nteacher: Nice!\nstudent: and I have enough money to buy smth\nteacher: Ooh, nice! What might you buy?\nstudent: what is better- an iPad or an iPhone?\nteacher: Hmm, to be honest I have none! My phone is an android and I've never had a tablet, just a laptop\nstudent: I want to buy a tablet for school\nteacher: What are the pros and cons of each in your opinion?\nstudent: there are too many books and sometimes my back hurts\nteacher: too ___ books\nstudent: so I have started searching for a nice ipad\nstudent: many\nteacher: Oh yes, I remember that problem from school. My deskmate and I used to divide the books between us\nteacher: yes, many, books are countable!\nstudent: my deskmate is awful\nteacher: Have you got all your books in e-format?\nteacher: Oh no, that's a shame!\nstudent: like we just find the copy of the book in the internet\nstudent: and upload it\nteacher: I see, that's so convenient!\nteacher: It's definitely a strong argument for an ipad, right?\nstudent: I had a folder for my notebooks, and because of the books it\nstudent: broke\nstudent: yes it is\nteacher: Are there any cons?\nstudent: hmm\nstudent: not all teachers support such books)\nstudent: support\nteacher: Oh yes, I can see that. Even with one book for both of us, my deskmate and I were told off for not having a book each!\nstudent: one year ago I had an iPad, but it is very old, so we don't use it now\nstudent: why?\nteacher: They used to say we needed a book each! But that would mean each of us would have to lug around 6 books + all notebooks every day\nstudent: awful\nteacher: Yes, it's a real problem!\nteacher: So what are the pros and cons of an iphone?\nstudent: my phone will go to my mom:)\nteacher: Haha, ok :) the one you have now you mean?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: But you won't be able to have all your books in it and read comfortably?\nstudent: I don't like my deskmate because our class teacher made us sit like that\nstudent: yes\nteacher: I see, it wasn't your choice?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: That's a shame! I'm still friends with my former deskmate\nteacher: We're also thinking about a big purchase. A car!\nstudent: cool!\nteacher: I think we will buy one when this lockdown finishes, whenever it is (probably in the spring)\nteacher: We'd like a hybrid one. Do you know what I mean by a hybrid car?\nstudent: which one do you want to buy?\nstudent: no\nteacher: It runs off petrol and electricity. While it runs off petrol, the electric battery gets charged and it can continue on electricity. And when it runs out of electricity, it switches back to petrol\nteacher: A bit greener and more economical than just a petrol one\nstudent: nice\nstudent: of course only electricity would be better, but it costs a lot\nteacher: Yes, it's so tempting to buy a car because we have gone completely stir crazy in this lockdown\nteacher: Do you know 'stir-crazy'? It means annoyed and upset because you have to stay inside all the time\nstudent: I didn't know\nteacher: It's a good authentic expression, you should try it on Ms. Patel :)\nteacher: But of course, at the moment we aren't allowed to go anywhere anyway\nstudent: My grammar is better after our lessons, so sometimes it helps)\nstudent: our lockdown finished 2 days ago(\nteacher: Oh I'm glad you're feeling the effect!\nteacher: Oh really, I didn't realize! Are you back at school then?\nstudent: yes\nstudent: that's sad\nteacher: Sorry to hear that!\nteacher: My son is also prefers the lockdown to school\nstudent: our government knows that the coronavirus spread is very fast now in Ukraine, but they aren't doing anything!\nteacher: *oops! Which word do I not need in this sentence?\nstudent: is\nteacher: That's right :)\nteacher: Really? This is so frustrating!!\nstudent: even with schools! a lot of our teachers were ill, and our principal didn't want to close the school because we are a gymnasium\nteacher: Ha, it doesn't make you immune to the virus, does it?\nstudent: maybe\nteacher: It's such a tricky thing with the word 'gymnasium' in English. Do you know what it means?\nstudent: no\nteacher: It means 'a gym'. A place where people go to do sports!\nstudent: oh\nstudent: I know 'gym'\nteacher: And a school which offer more advanced teaching is a grammar school or an academy\nteacher: Yes, of course, you do. It's a short for gymnasium!\nteacher: *sorry, which offerS\nstudent: ok\nteacher: Do you remember what we call words that sound similar in different languages but mean different things?\nstudent: forgot\nteacher: false friends, right?\nstudent: sorry\nstudent: yes\nteacher: no worries\nteacher: I also studied at a gymnasium, but it's best not to say it to English speakers :) They will think you went to a gym instead of a school!\nstudent: heh\nteacher: Ok, let's have a look back at our text about the brain!\nteacher: I'll give you a word from the previous class and you try to remember what it means, ok?\nteacher: neuroscience\nstudent: the science of neurons\nstudent: of our brains\nteacher: yes, about the nervous system (which a brain is a part of)\nteacher: a hemisphere\nteacher: If you don't remember, just say so, ok?\nstudent: oy wait\nteacher: ok\nstudent: I didn't see it\nteacher: no worries\nstudent: a half of our brain\nteacher: Yes, exactly. The left and the right hemisphere. It comes from the Greek language where 'hemi' is 'half' and 'sphere' is, well you can guess it :)\nteacher: a round object\nteacher: Ok, next one! Do you remember 'a lobe'?\nstudent: hm\nstudent: no\nteacher: it's a part of an organ, for example a part of the brain\nteacher: And one last! Scientists believe that humans _____ from primates. (the verb for changing over a long period of time)\nstudent: evolve\nteacher: Yes, well done!\nteacher: Ok, could you go back to the text (the link is in your Skype), read it again and decide whether these sentences are true or false\nteacher: 1. A person\u2019s brain is fully formed when they are 20 years old. 2. An amygdala is involved in thinking and calculating. 3. Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers in our bodies. 4. The effect of dopamine on behaviour is negative. 5. A teenage brain is not as good at judgement and impulse control as an adult brain.\nstudent: 1. false 2. false 3. true 4. false 5. false\nteacher: Ok, why is (1) false?\nstudent: it is fully formed at 25\nteacher: it's still forming 'well into your early twenties', right? Maybe there is no clear limit, it doesn't say it's formed at 25\nteacher: But the statement was false :)\nteacher: What about the second one?\nstudent: amygdalae are involved in experiencing emotions\nteacher: Yes, correct!\nteacher: The third one is indeed true. What about dopamine, number 4?\nstudent: Dopamine motivates us to do things, to feel interested in life, to seek out new experiences.\nteacher: Ah, so not all negative, right?\nteacher: and number 5? why is it false?\nstudent: oy it is true\nteacher: Haha, yes, it is! well done!\nstudent: Back to the lobes, in the teenage brain, the frontal lobe, which is responsible for problem solving, judgement and impulse control, isn't fully developed, so because you're dealing with heightened emotions before you've developed ways of putting the brakes on, you may sometimes be feeling a little out of control\u2026\nteacher: Correct!\nteacher: Ok, thank you very much, I've got let you go. Shall we say same time next week? next Tuesday 3.30 pm?\nstudent: Thank you for the lesson! what about Friday?\nteacher: Oh, I can't do Friday this week, sorry! because of the lockdown. I hope in a couple of weeks we will be able to do two lessons a week again!\nstudent: okay, bye!\nteacher: Ok, take care!",
    "student: Hi Mrs. Cooper!\nteacher: Hello! :)\nteacher: How are you doing?\nstudent: Fine thank you!\nstudent: How are you?\nstudent: Sorry, I'm a bit late\nstudent: I was putting my new lens on the eye )\nstudent: Contact lens ))\nstudent: *lens\nteacher: No worries, do you mean contact lenses?\nstudent: Yes, but I have to wear just the one\nstudent: ))\nteacher: Yes, I'm with you. I didn't know you wore contacts!\nteacher: Oh, I see!\nstudent: I've worn it since last Thursday )\nteacher: I see! Nice present perfect :) How do you like it?\nstudent: So It's ok you didn't know )))\nteacher: Sure :)\nstudent: It's quite strange, but it's ok )\nstudent: Actually it's interesting and it's about our brain\nteacher: Ooh, I love brain stuff, tell me!\nstudent: So the doctor told me that I have a very tiny 'kosoglazie' in my left eye\nteacher: Ok!\nstudent: But I've had it since I was a child\nstudent: So when I need to use that part of my left eye, which has to be used for objects that are close to me, my brain switches off the part of my left eye and I see with just the right one\nteacher: How interesting!\nstudent: It could happen if a person who has this problem is younger than 10\nteacher: is older than 10 you mean?\nstudent: at this age our brain is very flexible and can do things like that )\nstudent: sorry, younger\nteacher: aah, younger, yes, makes sense!\nstudent: sorry\nstudent: yes!\nstudent: younger\nteacher: So this is something your brain has been doing since you were a child?\nstudent: yes, and before even doctors couldn't find the problem\nteacher: I see\nstudent: But now I feel like my eyes are tired when I'm working with gadgets during the day\nstudent: Especially with my iPhone\nteacher: Is the idea that the contact lense will correct your left eye somehow?\nstudent: And I feel how my left eye starts to 'kosit'')\nstudent: kosit'\nstudent: Sure, the contact lens has to help with this stuff\nteacher: I think we say in this case the eye is 'misaligned'\nteacher: Ok, have you felt better since you started wearing it?\nstudent: so the idea is that my brain can control my eyes but when I'm working for a long time the brain is tired and can't control the left eye\nteacher: Ok, and the left eye starts to misbehave! interesting\nstudent: So I have to help my eyes and my brain )\nteacher: Cool, I hope it works!\nstudent: Ok, have you felt better since you started wearing it?  - Actually, I don't feel it 100%\nteacher: You don't feel it works 100%?\nstudent: But I'm now using the lenses which are not 100% for my case\nteacher: Yes, makes sense\nstudent: But as the doctor explained, we can't start with the right lenses we have to start with like lighter ones )\nteacher: Ok, yes\nteacher: Is it difficult to put on your lense?\nstudent: So misaligned is like 'kosit' in Russian?\nstudent: Is it difficult to put on your lense?  - Oh, I like the question )\nstudent: Ok\nstudent: There are two types of lenses\nstudent: You can wear the first one for one month and you can take it off at night\nstudent: The second type is one-day lenses\nteacher: If something is misaligned, it does not fit together with other parts, for example\nstudent: You put it on in the morning and then you throw it away in the evening\nteacher: If we align things, we put them together in a straight line\nteacher: \u0259\u02c8la\u026an\nstudent: So in the clinic I tried to do all the stuff with the first type of lenses\nstudent: It is more difficult to put it on but it's easier to take it off\nteacher: You throw them away? They are disposable? Only for one day\nteacher: I've never heard of disposable lenses\nstudent: But now I use the one-day lenses and it's better for my eyes\nteacher: take it off, right? Like clothes, we put them on and we take them off\nstudent: it's better\nstudent: Ah! Ok! Sure\nstudent: take it off )\nstudent: So! Yes, there are disposable lenses )\nstudent: And they are more\nstudent: hm\nteacher: Interesting! You're using disposable lenses then. If we can only use something once and then we have to throw it away (dispose of it), we call the object disposable\nstudent: they are 'propuskaut bolshy vozduha'\nteacher: Oh, they are more breathable\nstudent: And it's easier to put them on but!\nstudent: It's harder to take them off!\nteacher: I see! There's always a catch\nstudent: It took me about 15 minutes about 2 days ago\nstudent: I was so angry\nstudent: )))\nstudent: There's always a catch ? )\nteacher: It took you about 15 minutes\nteacher: Yes, a catch = something negative\nstudent: It took you about 15 minutes  - Sure, thank you\nteacher: For example, if I tell you, would you like to buy this car, it's a brand new Mercedez and I will sell it to you for 1000 UAH\nteacher: You will say, hmmm, this is too good to be true. What's the catch?\nstudent: aha!\nteacher: And the catch is, for example, it was stolen)))\nstudent: hahaha\nteacher: or the doors don't open, or something like that\nteacher: You probably know the expression 'catch 22'\nteacher: a situation when you can't escape; whatever you do is wrong\nstudent: no\nteacher: I'm trying to remember what it is in Russian!\nteacher: It's the name of a novel\nstudent: I'v never heard of it\nteacher: For example, our government :)) they are in a bit of a catch 22. If they remove the lockdown, lots of people will die, but if they don't, the economy will collapse\nstudent: I googled it\nstudent: ulovka 22\nteacher: This is what the dictionary says for 'catch 22'\nteacher: an impossible situation where you are prevented from doing one thing until you have done another thing that you cannot do until you have done the first thing\nteacher: Ah, yes, probably ulovka\nstudent: But I don't know the novel unfortunatelly\nteacher: Neither do I, I haven't read it!\nteacher: But it's a popular expression. Even though catch 22 is paradoxical, it's quite a common situation :)\nstudent: Ah! There is also a movie\nteacher: Yes, that's right! I haven't seen that one either :)\nstudent: George Clooney is the director\nteacher: I see, yes! It might be worth checking out\nstudent: I forgot these two, neither and either ((\nteacher: I haven't read the book. I haven't seen the movie either / Neither have I seen the movie\nstudent: I see\nteacher: I've read the book. I've seen the movie too.\nstudent: thank you\nteacher: too = we agree with an affirmative sentence\nteacher: neither / not either = we agree with a negative sentence\nteacher: For example. I haven't got a dog. What about you?\nstudent: Oh! 7.8 on IMDB\nstudent: I mean Catch-22 )\nteacher: Is that good? Is that out of 10?\nstudent: yes. 7.8 is veeery good\nteacher: Ok, cool!\nstudent: usually more than 7 or 7.5 is  good\nteacher: Oh, have you watched Little Miss Sunshine? What did you think?\nstudent: you know, my husband checks all the movies on IMDM ))))\nstudent: unfortunately I haven't\nteacher: Yes, sure, I check the Rotten Tomatoes score :)\nteacher: No worries, I just thought you might have. I don't have time to watch movies at all at the moment! We go to bed early, which means we only have time for TV shows!\nstudent: But I still want to!\nstudent: What is Rotten Tomatoes? ))\nstudent: We were at the cinema!!!! on Monday )\nteacher: It's a website which collects film reviews and calculates a score based on them. It's like critics' score as opposed to 'normal people' who watch it\nteacher: No way! Lucky you!\nstudent: We finished work earlier and went to the cinema at 16.40\nteacher: Is the lockdown finished then?\nteacher: Ah, I'm jealous. What did you see?\nstudent: so there were about 5 people besides us )\nstudent: I feel like the cinema is the safest place now ))\nteacher: Niiiice!\nstudent: Yes, the lockdown is finished but we never know when the new one will start ))\nstudent: So the film\nteacher: Ok, interesting.\nstudent: Another Round )\nteacher: Is that the name of the film?\nstudent: yes\nstudent: It's Danish I think\nteacher: Cool!\nstudent: We like it\nstudent: I would recommend it\nstudent: I think you can watch it on Netflix\nstudent: When you have the time\nteacher: Nice, thank you. Whenever we have the time again\nstudent: I know that now it's difficult )\nteacher: School might not re-open here until after Easter!\nstudent: Oh!!\nteacher: about 2,5 months\nteacher: *schools\nstudent: OOOOOh!\nteacher: It's a very very long time :)\nstudent: yes )\nstudent: Be strong )\nteacher: Thank you :) We are mostly ok\nstudent: Oh! I have to tell you\nstudent: There is an Ukrainian platform like Netflix\nteacher: But I'm daydreaming about travelling all the time. Even simply catching a train to Cambridge, something I haven't done for nearly a year now!\nteacher: Oh really?\nstudent: It's not as big )\nstudent: But\nstudent: There are some Ukrainian movies and even with subtitles\nstudent: So maybe it will be useful for you or your students\nteacher: Ooh, sounds nice! But the problem will again be time :(\nstudent: it's called takflix\nteacher: tak like 'yes'?\nstudent: I see!! But maybe after the lockdown\nstudent: yes/ Tak like yes )\nstudent: It's funny )\nteacher: Got you, thanks for the recommendation!\nstudent: I've realized just now that it's like the opposite of Net-flix )\nteacher: We actually watched 'The Servant of the People' on Netflix, long before Zelenskiy ran for a president\nteacher: Aaah, I see! Netflix - takflix :)))\nstudent: yes! )))))\nstudent: Actually I've never seen 'The Servant...' )\nstudent: Is it funny? )\nteacher: Well, it won't be the same now I think, after he actually became the president\nteacher: It's quite good, yes!\nstudent: you are right!\nteacher: He is this hero who uncovers corruption and is not interested in money, just wants to do the right thing etc. etc.\nstudent: haha\nteacher: It's quite clever\nstudent: yes, now it's different I think )\nteacher: Yep\nteacher: Ok, I've got to let you go! We'll speak again on Friday, right?\nstudent: Yes!\nstudent: Thank you Mrs. Cooper!\nteacher: So I can actually see why people voted for him after this show\nteacher: You're very welcome, it's my pleasure\nstudent: It was a good example of\nstudent: of an election campaign )\nstudent: Have a good day!\nstudent: Bye xxx\nteacher: Yes, it was a very original election campaign, that's for sure!\nteacher: Thank you, have a lovely day too, bye!",
    "teacher: Morning Emily!\nstudent: Hi! I\u2019m on my way ( I think it\u2019s about 5 more minutes. I\u2019m very sorry!\nteacher: Ah, ok, no worries!\nstudent: Hi )\nstudent: I'm here. Sorry\nstudent: It's snowing today in Kyiv\nteacher: Oh really?\nteacher: No problem, good to have you here. Busy morning?\nstudent: Yes, quite busy\nstudent: But I think it's my fault, I shouldn't have slept till late morning )\nteacher: Sleep is important!\nteacher: You had a ___ -___ :)\nstudent: hm\nteacher: Remember? When we stay in bed until later than usual\nstudent: what's it about?\nteacher: a lie-in\nstudent: Ah!\nstudent: I remember the word\nteacher: Sorry, it came a bit out of context for you\nstudent: I just didn't understand the context, sorry\nteacher: I know\nteacher: We're back to a mild winter again. I don't know if we're going to get more snow this winter!\nteacher: Liam and I are taking part in the Big Garden Birdwatch today\nstudent: It's warmer here too\nteacher: It's organized by a wildlife charity\nteacher: It's warmer in Kyiv too? Will the snow settle or melt, what do you think?\nstudent: Now it's about -3 so it's quite warm for Kyiv\nteacher: Haha, yes, tropical!\nstudent: I think it will settle. It's going to be about -2 in the afternoon\nstudent: Sure, tropical ))\nstudent: If I'm right, you took part in such event before\nteacher: Yes, you remember! We do it every year\nstudent: I mean the Big Garden Birdwatch\nstudent: Ok! And what should you do?\nteacher: We've got to spend an hour in the garden watching birds and recording which ones we see\nteacher: We've got a chart\nteacher: And then we send the results to this charity, and they see how numbers change from year to year\nstudent: Wow\nstudent: do you have a special form for it?\nteacher: We bring some popcorn, birdfood and two pairs of binoculars\nteacher: Yes, they sent us a special form\nteacher: in advance\nstudent: Do you have many birds in your garden usually?\nstudent: *birds\nteacher: Yes, we do! A lot of our neighbours don't look after our gardens, which means there are lots of trees and bushes there and it's ideal for birds\nteacher: They ate all my cherries off a tree last summer :((\nstudent: Ok! Are there any rare ones?\nteacher: Nooo, unfortunately. Just sparrows, blue tits (sinitsy) and wood pidgeons and blackbirds\nstudent: Oh! You should complain to the charity! )\nteacher: Haha, they will say I did a good thing, providing food for birds. They are not on my side!\nstudent: haha )\nteacher: And we've got some news! We've decided to buy a car when the lockdown is over!\nstudent: blackbirds? I think they are rare here\nteacher: You know that we've lived without a car for 5 years here, which is quite unusual\nteacher: We have finally given in!\nstudent: A car! Wow! It's a big deal! Does Matthew or you have a license?\nteacher: Matthew has a license, I can't even drive! I'll have to learn\nstudent: We have finally given in!  - give in? )\nstudent: *given in?\nteacher: to give in = to finally agree to something after refusing for a long time\nteacher: Like Jason, he finally gave in and started watching TV shows :)\nstudent: Oh! I have a license but it's so hard for me mentally to drive (\nteacher: Especially in Kyiv!\nteacher: Do you drive sometimes?\nstudent: Sometimes I think that I need more practice but sometimes I think that it's just not for me )\nteacher: Everybody driver here. I'm a bit of an odd one out\nstudent: sure! Give in! Useful expression!\nteacher: *sorry, everybody drives\nstudent: I'm a bit of an odd one out? Like unusual?\nteacher: Yes, like, my toddler was asking for a new LOL and I finally gave in :)\nteacher: Yes!\nstudent: No, I don't drive (\nteacher: Do you think it would be useful to you to drive? Or are you happy not to drive?\nstudent: To be honest I'm happy not to drive ) But sometimes it would be very useful because of Emily/ Sometimes Jason doesn't have the time to pick us up or take us somewhere. And I could do it, but I can't )\nteacher: Fair enough! Maybe we should do it at the same time, I'll learn and you practise more and we both hit the road :)\nstudent: You know. I feel very under pressure\nstudent: When I'm driving\nstudent: we both hit the road - hahaha )\nteacher: Yes, it must be so stressful!\nstudent: You are right! Maybe I should try.\nstudent: ok\nteacher: I cycle everywhere, but only in our tiny town. I wouldn't cycle in London, for example, if I didn't know the neighbourhood very well\nstudent: how to say 'proshlo mnogo vremeni s tekh por'\nstudent: ?\nteacher: Anyway, I've prepared some car vocabulary for you! and a bit about cars from the BBC\nteacher: It's been a long time since...\nstudent: Yes! Thank you\nstudent: So it's been a long time since I had tried to drive\nteacher: So you know how cars can be petrol / diesel and electric?\nstudent: how they can be? Sorry?\nstudent: I know these three options\nteacher: Oh sorry, I mean the fuel that cars use.\nstudent: *these\nteacher: Yes, of course you do\nteacher: We would actually like a hybrid car, the one with a petrol engine and an electric battery\nstudent: Would you like an electric car?\nstudent: Ah! I see\nteacher: \u02c8ha\u026a.br\u026ad\nstudent: Do you know which make it is going to be?\nteacher: We would love an electric car, but we can't afford one\nteacher: they are 'unaffordable'\nteacher: affordable / unaffordable\nteacher: very good words to talk about buying things\nteacher: Yes, we're looking at Toyotas, they have a very nice range of affordable hybrids\nstudent: I see, it's too expensive\nteacher: yes, unaffordable = too expensive, that's right!\nstudent: affordable / unaffordable - sure! It's very useful! I have to remember it )\nstudent: Oh!\nteacher: Yes, very useful words\nstudent: Actually\nstudent: several days ago we were talking with Jason about some 'save nature' stuff\nstudent: )\nteacher: ok, yes ))\nstudent: I don't know the right word for it\nstudent: And he told me that there is an opinion that electric cars are not so safe for nature\nteacher: Ah, ok, better for the planet, greener option etc\nteacher: better for the environment\nstudent: Ah! ok! Thank you\nteacher: Well, hybrids use less petrol, so they are both economical and better for the planet\nstudent: Ok! So. It takes lots of resources to make the energy for electric cars\nteacher: Yes, but it doesn't have to be from fossil fuels! One day it could even be solar energy\nteacher: If something is economical, it saves you money. Or if a person is economical, they are good at saving money\nteacher: economical car, economical person\nteacher: but!\nteacher: an economic crisis; economic growth\nstudent: yes! I mean that now hybrids could be even better for the environment\nstudent: Ah! I like the words\nstudent: economical and economic\nteacher: Yes, I like them too :)\nstudent: it's the same in Ukrainian and Russian\nteacher: Yes, of course it is! I haven't thought about it, weirdly, but you're right!\nstudent: I think in Ukrainian we have two, so different words\nteacher: But in Russian the short word means 'economical'\nteacher: and the long one means 'economic'))\nstudent: zaoshchadlivyi and economichnyi\nteacher: Ah, yes, of course, that's a good word!\nstudent: and the long one means 'economic')) - sure!! )\nteacher: Ok, next word! At the moment, one of the problems with electric cars is that there aren't many charge points\nteacher: You know, a special plug where you can charge your electric car\nteacher: If you have a garage or a driveway, you can have your own charge point\nstudent: yes!\nstudent: I know that it's a big problem for drivers actually\nteacher: If you have your own garage or driveway, it means you have 'off-street parking'\nstudent: driveway?\nteacher: You don't have to park you car in the street\nteacher: You know, in front of some English houses there is a space for a car\nteacher: A driveway\nstudent: Ah! I see\nteacher: *there is space\nstudent: it's not a garage. but a special place\nstudent: Here in Kyiv we usually have car parks\nteacher: Yes, we haven't got one :) We have a front garden instead, but our neighbours haven't got a front garden, they have a driveway. They are more practical people :)\nteacher: Yes, of course, you have car parks\nstudent: haha )\nstudent: Could you leave your car on the street?\nstudent: It's not against the rules?\nteacher: Ok, a couple more words and I'll leave you with some homework :)\nstudent: Sorry, car\nstudent: Not cat ))))\nteacher: Yes, we can park on the street! But of course, there is competition. You know, who gets to this space first :)\nteacher: not cat)))\nstudent: Yes! It's a tight game )\nteacher: Ok! Our next word is 'a bonnet'. It's a part of a car that covers the engine\nteacher: Ha, yes, it is!\nstudent: Don't leave your cat on the street ))\nteacher: Oh, there are so many cats around who live a half-wild life and hunt charity protected birds\nteacher: But back to cars!\nteacher: It's important for a driver to have an idea about what goes on under the bonnet\nteacher: things like that\nstudent: under the bonnet\nstudent: ,\nstudent: ?\nstudent: Ah, ok\nstudent: I see\nteacher: a bonnet = a metal cover over the engine\nstudent: to know how the car works )\nteacher: kapot??? I'm not sure\nstudent: kapot! Yes! )\nstudent: Is 'bonnet' a French word?\nteacher: Ha, that's interesting! Just like kapot, a bonnet also means an old-fashioned women's hat. You know, the one that covers ears\nteacher: Babies wear bonnets too\nteacher: Oh, good question. It might be a French word, but it's pronounced \u02c8b\u0252n.\u026at\nteacher: Not in a French way\nstudent: Ok! I see!\nstudent: Ms. Taylor! It's time! I guess you have to go )\nteacher: I'm ok! Do you have to go?\nstudent: I'm sorry for being late!\nteacher: No worries\nstudent: We can continue next week ) Thank you very much for the lesson and your patience )\nteacher: Ok, I'm going to send you your homework in Messenger, ok?\nteacher: Have a lovely weekend! You're very welcome :)\nstudent: You too! Thank you! xx\nstudent: Bye!\nstudent: )\nteacher: Take care )",
    "student: Hello!\nteacher: Hi Emma Smith!\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: Fine thank you :) Happy that the weekend is almost here..what about you?\nteacher: About the same as you! No homeschooling for two days :)\nstudent: Lockdowns...I wonder when they'll finish...\nteacher: We've got a tentative date for the return of schools, 8 March\nstudent: Here I believe they are talking about mid-February, but they have already delayed it a few times...\nstudent: moreover vaccinations aren't going very well..\nteacher: Yes, I've heard!\nteacher: Is the UK fast-spreading variant in Austria / Italy yet? I hope it isn't!\nstudent: I think they found a few cases, but so far it isn't widespread...\nteacher: They are being very cautious with promises and deadlines here, since they spent most of 2020 overpromising and underdelivering\nteacher: I hope they'll be able to contain them!\nstudent: I hope so too...but I also hope that they'll fix the problem with vaccines and end this covid story for good...\nteacher: Definitely, it can't happen too soon!\nstudent: In the meanwhile the Italian government has fallen and we still don't know if we'll have to vote again or the parties will find an agreement and propose a new government..\nteacher: At the end of March it will be a year since the first lockdown started, and my son will have spent 9 months at home out of 12. I can't say I don't like this, to be honest :)\nstudent: Me niether...the same is true for my second son who is now 17 months old, he has lived more than half of his life with a raging worldwide pandemic\nteacher: Oh goodness! I've been focusing on corona news at home too much, I've completely missed that!\nteacher: Yes, indeed, most of his life!\nteacher: What happened? Was it a coup, in Italy?\nstudent: Well...Italy is notorious for its short-lived governments...during the seventies there was one year with three different governments!\nstudent: The prime minister didn't have enough support from the parties and had to resign\nteacher: I see! Are you glad or disappointed?\nstudent: I think politics should focus on organizing the vaccination program, not on finding a new prime minister...\nteacher: Yes, the timing is wrong!\nstudent: Indeed...well, we shall see what happens\nteacher: You've got two boys then? You said your second son...\nstudent: Yes, two little terminators\nteacher: Haha, yes, it's a truly wild age\nstudent: I mean: they are lovely...but they are really good at destroying stuff..especially when living confined at home\nteacher: Don't worry, I know what you mean\nstudent: Haha, I see :)\nteacher: I wonder if you're noticing any differences in how people parent in Austria compared to Italy\nteacher: I'm always curious about parenting culture in different countries\nstudent: Well...I would say people in Italy tend to be overprotective, here children are given more responsibilities...\nteacher: OK, interesting. Even at a young age?\nstudent: Yes...I mean, nothing as extreme as in Japan...but for example in Italy a 12-year-old can't go home alone from school\nstudent: even if he/she lives in a little village...here this isn't the case\nteacher: Interesting!\nstudent: (I'd add this wasn't the case when I was young, but people sued a school because some child had accidents while returning home...and now no school allows your child to go home alone until they are...I don't know, maybe 14...)\nteacher: What I love about English parenting is growing weather-resistant children :) No matter what the weather is like outside, a child is expected to put their wellies on and play outside\nstudent: I would also say that here people tend to have children when they are a bit younger, and mothers remain home for up to 3 years...the welfare in Italy isn't this good\nstudent: and I felt like a black sheep: having children before 30 is really rare nowadays, especially for people who went to university\nstudent: Haha, here also they always go outiside when there is some light :)\nteacher: I see! I think here the expectation is that children are picked up from primary school, until the age of 11, but I'm not sure how it works with secondary. I see lots of children getting home on their own / with friends / cycling home on their own, in their secondary school uniforms\nstudent: I wouldn't say that happens in Italy (on average)\nteacher: Is it early for Italy? or for Austria?\nstudent: For Italy!\nstudent: When my wife went to the antenatal class she was the youngest, the second youngest was 4 years older than her...and most women were in their late thirties or fourties..\nstudent: (all of them at their first pregnancy)\nteacher: Wow, interesting!\nteacher: A thing that annoys me about parenting in the UK is that it's very learning theory-based. The idea that a child needs to be taught, well, everything, rather than allowed to mature into a more civilized creature\nstudent: I can see how that plays out with the British spirit of order and discipline..haha...\nteacher: Here I must say that I study developmental psychology, so I've been thinking and reading about this a lot.\nteacher: Yes, this is very very British, very John Locke\nteacher: Would you say Italy is different?\nstudent: Hmm... I don't know what 'very John Locke' means...is this a saying or is he a very well known gentleman?\nstudent: Yes, I would say that on average people in Italy listen to all the whimsical requests of their children...so they sort of feed the non-civilized part of their children...\nteacher: Probably not outside the UK! He was a 17th century philosopher who was the founder of learning theory, with his idea of 'tabula rasa'\nteacher: and how to teach and train children to be good members of society and well-rounded people\nstudent: Of course not everyone, but I have seen many spoiled children...\nstudent: Oh, now I recall! I studied something about him in philosophy, but I didn't think about how this translates into bringing up children!\nteacher: Ah, fascinating stuff! Anyway, I've got to stop myself here and take you back to vocabulary practice\nteacher: Yes, it's only recently that I've realized what tremendous effect philosophers have on our everyday life, by forming concepts in people's heads\nteacher: Have you had a chance to read the article on classes?\nstudent: I remember interdisciplinarity was a big 'idea' during high school for teachers...but they never really managed to show us how their subjects extended well beyond their lectures and affected other subjects or other aspects of human life...\nteacher: I feel very Marxist when I say that...\nstudent: Haha, I see...unfortunately I only had the time to read the comment that opened the can of worms..\nteacher: Ha, yes, they still had to follow the same curriculum I guess\nteacher: No worries! good use of the idiom :)\nteacher: Ok, I'll be sending you bits of comments and we can focus on the vocabulary, ok?\nstudent: Okay, great!\nteacher: I think part of the issue is that we don't live in an age any more where whether you are working class or middle class is a very clear cut and obvious thing. Fifty years ago you could have told by someone's dress, address, and job title. now, not so much. Being 'working class' no longer means you're going down the pit each day, and being middle class no longer means having a house in the suburbs and going to work in a suit, so it's no surprise that class has become less solidly defined and more about self perception.\nteacher: Did we talk about 'clear cut' last time? I can't remember\nstudent: I am pretty sure we didn't\nteacher: Yes, sure, just the can of worms :)\nstudent: It refers to a situation where two things are strongly separated or divided, right?\nteacher: a clear cut distinction = very intuitive and a good expression!\nteacher: Yes, where you can clearly see the distinction\nstudent: I see...well, the meaning is quite apparent in this case :)\nteacher: For example, children believe there are goodies and badies, but when a person grows up, they usually realize that it's not that clear cut\nteacher: Hmm, is it badies or baddies? I guess there must be a double dd. I've realized I've never seen this word written down, but my son says it a lot\nteacher: Ok, moving on, I was wondering how you understand 'going down the pit each day'? It's not an idiom, more like a cultural thing\nstudent: Sorry, I had to go outside one sec\nteacher: no worries, I'll give you a minute to catch up\nstudent: baddies..haha, I see...indeed, the distinction between good and bad people is not as clear cut as it is in movies...\nstudent: Hmm...does it mean to go to a very bad job? Something you don't like?\nstudent: I think I have read it before...but never understood its meaning\nteacher: They mean going down the mine, to work\nteacher: like a coal mine\nstudent: Oh, okay...well now I can see why they use the word 'pit'\nteacher: The idea is, you don't have to be a miner or a builder to be working class these days\nteacher: Yes, like I say, it's not an idiom, just a cultural thing. I guess in Italy too?\nstudent: No, I don't think we have anything similar...\nstudent: and well, Italy doesn't have many mines so we have few references to mines in our culture...\nteacher: Just a week ago, I would have happily said that there aren't many mines left in the UK at all, but they've just approved the building of a new one. It beats me why, considering they are trying to cut down on emissions\nteacher: a new coal mine that is\nstudent: Oh...indeed, that's disturbing...\nteacher: Yes, very!\nteacher: Ok, here's another piece\nteacher: The reasons that middle class people would try to play up proletarian origins seem accurate.\nteacher: play up\nteacher: vs. play down\nstudent: Oh that's new...the closest thing I can think of is 'making up', are the two meanings related?\nstudent: no, if there is play up and play down they clearly aren't...\nstudent: does it mean to make something apparent vs. hiding it?\nteacher: Hmm, not exactly. If you play something up, you exaggerate.\nstudent: As in the proletarian origin?\nteacher: For example, someone whose mother was a scientist and whose father was a builder could only choose to mention their father's job\nteacher: and that's playing up their working class background\nstudent: I see...\nstudent: Oh, okay...so 'Some people believe the governments are playing up the current covid situation. Little do they know that many governments actually played it down...China for example'\nteacher: Or, they could only mention their mother's job, and then they are playing down their working class background!\nstudent: (as an example)\nteacher: Yes, exactly, excellent example!\nteacher: Little ___ they know that...\nstudent: do\nstudent: ?\nteacher: Yes, absolutely! You knew that, right? The inversion\nstudent: Yes, but for some reasons I completely removed it from the sentence...\nteacher: No worries, it happens. I'm just trying to see whether you'd like any explanation from me or whether you've got it\nteacher: Ok, I think we'll manage one more today! This comment:\nteacher: I'm 'middle class' by classic definition. In reality, that meant I had educated parents, a nice stable home. I had a good education, but my parents didn't give me a leg up beyond that - I didn't benefit from connections, or even money, particularly (we weren't hugely well off). None of that is meant to be a hard luck/self made man story, I had a good start.\nteacher: Can you spot a nice idiom?\nstudent: give a leg up\nteacher: Yes, exactly. Also very intuitive\nteacher: If you're helping your one-year-old climb onto a sofa, you're giving them a leg up\nstudent: It means to help someone?\nteacher: And metaphorically, if you're sending them to a better school, paying for university, pulling a few strings so that they can get a nice job etc. etc.\nstudent: I see :)\nteacher: To help, in a way that gives them an advantage they can move from\nteacher: Is 'pull a few strings' familiar?\nstudent: Yes...that means to use some of your connections in order to obtain something\nstudent: right?\nteacher: Yes, absolutely!\nteacher: Ok! Let's see what we've got for next week. Are Monday and Wednesday still no good for you? Because I could offer you a class at 9 am...\nstudent: Monday is still not good\nstudent: Maybe on Wednesday we can do it\nteacher: Wednesday 9 am? Would this be ok?\nstudent: Okay\nstudent: Then see you on Wednesday :) And thank you for the lesson!\nstudent: Have a nice weekend!\nteacher: Lovely, thank you! I do appreciate you accommodating this\nteacher: Hope the madness will be over in March! Have a lovely weekend, thank you!\nstudent: Me too! Thank you again and bye :)",
    "student: Hi! Sorry I need a couple more minutes\nteacher: Hi Liam Smith, no problem\nstudent: Here I am :) How are you?\nteacher: Hi! All good, and you?\nstudent: All good...it is even a beautiful day here :)\nteacher: It's actually starting to feel like spring here! Daffodils are starting to pop through, and I've got snowdrops in my garden :)\nstudent: Oh, that's nice! I am also looking forward to seeing spring...so far it has really been a cold winter!\nteacher: Yes, it has been a colder winter! Which is good, but we've all really had enough by now\nstudent: Indeed! How is it going with the lockdown? Here it looks like next week they will remove some restrictions...\nstudent: *restrictions\nteacher: Oh really? I'm so happy for you!\nteacher: Well, we're in lockdown until at least March 8, and then there is going to be a phased exit with areas dropping restrictions but others still being quite strict\nteacher: They're now trying to trace and contain this South African variant which is also more contagious\nteacher: We are well stir crazy by now, fantasizing about travelling all the time and watching escapist TV\nstudent: haha...\nstudent: My current dream is to experience silence for a day...without hearing screams or cries from my children...\nstudent: but I will have to wait a bit longer for that...\nteacher: I'm feeling for you. Toddlerhood is tough!\nteacher: Didn't you say the childminder was still allowed to work?\nstudent: Yes...luckily she has always been allowed to work, so I had a few free mornings...\nstudent: but for a number of reasons she never worked 5 days a week...anyhow, if I didn't go crazy, it is probably also thanks to her help\nteacher: Good that you have some support! I can only say that it gets easier with time. Just as sweet, but a bit easier :)\nstudent: I really hope so :) well, to be honest the oldest child, almost 3, is starting to behave a bit..now it is his brother who is a bit problematic...\nteacher: Yes, they call this age 'the terrible twos' here, even though he isn't even 2 yet!\nstudent: I have heard that expression, yes...we don't have it in Italian, but it should definitely be imported!\nteacher: Haha, yes, but the danger is, once you say this, you start to see them in this way\nteacher: And three-year-olds are sometimes called 'threenagers'\nteacher: Because they can be moody like teenagers\nstudent: Haha...I had never heard of that expression!\nstudent: Threenagers, it sounds funny :)\nteacher: It does :))\nteacher: Ok, shall we have a look at the rest of the idioms from comments?\nstudent: Yes!\nstudent: I was just going to say that last week was extremely busy so I still haven't read the article...but I will!\nteacher: There are a couple more that I wanted to share with you\nteacher: You don't have to! I just thought it might give you some context, but it's by no means obligatory\nteacher: Oh, I think we didn't mention the meaning of 'play up' that is to do with children\nstudent: Don't worry...it is for me: the more I work on this, the more I learn\nstudent: No, we didn't...\nteacher: We talked about play up / play down, didn't we?\nstudent: Yes, even though I can't remember exactly the meaning\nstudent: and I am pretty sure children weren't involved\nteacher: Yes, you can talk about the crazy English notion of 'class' :)\nteacher: Yes, we talked in terms of 'exaggerate / minimize the importantce of'\nteacher: *sorry, I meant 'you can learn'\nstudent: OH yes, now I recall!\nteacher: Yes, but 'play up' (or 'act up') has another meaning: start to misbehave\nteacher: For example, little Peter is playing up a bit, he must be tired\nteacher: The boys have been playing up at school again\nstudent: My son Ethan always plays up after finishing a meal.\nteacher: After finishing a meal? Because he's full and happy? :)\nstudent: No, because he's full and realizes that leftover food has a big potential, if you want to soil the whole room.\nteacher: Haha :))\nteacher: Sorry, I shouldn't laugh!\nstudent: haha, it is funny, until you have to clean up the mess!\nteacher: a big potential as an art material\nteacher: Definitely\nteacher: Ok, we talked about 'giving someone a leg up', didn't we?\nstudent: Indeed...well, maybe the story about Cattelan's banana reached even the UK? The artist who used a banana for one of his art pieces...\nstudent: Yes, my childminder is giving me a leg up...would it be okay if used like this?\nteacher: No, is it a recent story? I haven't heard!\nteacher: Hmm, no, unless she paid for your PhD! :))\nstudent: No, that's not the case ;)\nstudent: It's from 2019, so ages ago https://news.artnet.com/art-world/maurizio-cattelan-banana-explained-1732773\nstudent: okay...but I am giving my children a leg up...\nteacher: The childminder probably gives your boys a leg up if they want to climb somewhere but can't\nteacher: Yes!\nteacher: you are giving your children a leg up\nteacher: Ah, now I remember, the image rings a bell!\nteacher: of a banana I mean\nstudent: Yes, it is one of those dumb stories that gets a lot of news coverage for a few days...so it would probably ring a bell to almost anyone\nteacher: Oh, this is an interesting comment, on the fluidity / rigidity of the class system\nteacher: The mistake is assuming that the middle class is closer to the upper class than to the working class. Losing one's job can make you go from middle class to working class in a heartbeat, but most will never even be close to the upper class even if they spend a lifetime doing very well.\nteacher: I think there are two nice expressions here, but which one would you pick?\nteacher: ones\nstudent: in a heartbeat'...meaning in a very short time\nteacher: Yes, exactly! a very good one\nstudent: to be honest I don't see a second one\nteacher: Oh, I meant 'to spend a lifetime (doing something)'\nteacher: Thinking about it, do well is also a good one\nteacher: Also, do well out of... She is a songwriter and is doing surprisingly well out of it\nteacher: which means have financial success\nstudent: Because of covid, many people aren't doing that well right now...\nteacher: Exactly!\nteacher: Covid cost so many people their livelihoods\nteacher: Ok, one last\nteacher: I admit it's not rocket science sociology. But the government probably need a commission to help them to understand this. So I hope the writer is doing his bit there.\nteacher: Have you heard the expression 'it's not rocket science'?\nstudent: Yes, to be honest I think it is used more often in the US, could that be the case?\nstudent: Anyway, it means 'it is nothing that complex'\nteacher: Hmm, I would say it's used in the UK as well!\nteacher: Yes, of course! What's a synonymous expression? 'It's not ___ ___'\nteacher: that is another field of knowledge\nstudent: oh... I really don't know...I know many people think math is hard, so I would guess 'It's not like math' but it doesn't sound right\nteacher: Nope, but good guess! The expression is 'it's not brain surgery'\nteacher: I've got to remember to send you a link to a comedy sketch about these two expressions after class\nstudent: I am pretty sure I had never heard that one...okay!\nteacher: Do you enjoy English comedy?\nstudent: Cool :) Yes, I do...to be honest I like it better than Italian comedy, which I find too dumb (as in I want to go out of the room because it is too embarrassing even to watch).\nteacher: Oh no! I'm trying to think what I know of Italian comedy. English can be pretty silly but can be quite sophisticated\nstudent: There are some movies which are produced for Christmas in Italy, called 'cinepanettone' (panettone-movie) which represent this awful Italian comedy...\nteacher: There is an English comedy website that does always cheer me up, it's called the Daily Mash. It kind of mimics a newspaper, but the news is satire\nstudent: Another example is Checco Zalone, his comedy is actually a bit better...\nteacher: It especially likes to make fun of middle class people\nteacher: Ah, I'm with you, there are awful awful awful comedy shows on TV in the UK, they make me blush too!\nteacher: And they also seem to culminate around Christmas\nstudent: I'll give it a look! We also have such satirical papers in Italian, I guess the most well known is 'lercio' meaning 'filthy'...but to be honest some of their pages are good, and the name is more of a pun with 'leggo' (I read) which is a newspaper.\nteacher: Ok, interesting!\nteacher: I must warn that it can be quite sweary. But funny!\nteacher: I'm thinking back to the expression you used, for something that provokes shame. We can say 'I'm ashamed of', but it doesn't really work with an -ing\nstudent: Haha, I see...well, to be honest, I believe the Italian culture is less concerned with swearing than the Anglo-Saxon one...I mean, it is a 'bad' thing...but it took me years to understand why on American TV shows they were censoring certain words...\nteacher: embarrassing' would probably be a good one here\nstudent: Okay...yes, I wasn't really sure how to express that...I find Italian comedy often embarrassing\nteacher: Hmm, actually, I wonder if Americans are more concerned with swearing than Brits\nteacher: Brits love to swear, including on TV\nteacher: Yes, and a good collocation is 'excrutiatingly embarrassing'\nstudent: really? I had never noticed...but then, I don't watch much TV from the UK...\nteacher: You know, excrutiating = horribly painful\nstudent: Nice :)\nteacher: excrutiating pain; excrutiatingly embarrassing\nstudent: Yes, I know that expression :)\nteacher: I can imagine Americans would be more prude about swearing\nteacher: Looking at it, I bet it's from Latin too\nteacher: excrutiating\nteacher: Anyway, would the same time next week suit you?\nstudent: Yes!\nteacher: Lovely!\nstudent: (I just checked: you are right, but the closest Italian word is a bit different, as it has lost the initial 'ex' sound and changed others)\nstudent: Perfect, then I guess see you next week :) Thank you for the lesson and have a nice day!\nteacher: Interesting! Knowing Romance languages has definitely given you a leg up in terms of English :)\nteacher: Yes, talk to you next week! My pleasure, bye!\nstudent: Yes, it definitely has! Bye!",
    "student: hi\nteacher: Hi Sophia!\nteacher: How is it going?\nstudent: I am fine, and you?\nteacher: I'm fine too, thank you\nteacher: How's school?\nstudent: boring\nstudent: as always\nteacher: Of course!\nteacher: I'm actually quite excited because the books that I ordered have just arrived. Have you heard of 'His Dark Materials'?\nstudent: no\nstudent: what is it about?\nteacher: Well, it's a TV show on the BBC based on three novels. My husband and I have watched the show and we are now going to read the books while waiting for season 3\nteacher: I think you would like it! It's a fantasy world, a bit like Harry Potter (but a very different world)\nteacher: In this world, people have animal companions that are like their souls, they are always with them\nstudent: nice\nteacher: Is you Internet connection ok?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: And it's about this girl Lyra, who is your age probably\nteacher: Anyway, I think you would enjoy the show and the books\nteacher: Have you seen / read anything exciting recently?\nstudent: I have read Taras Bulba\nstudent: I didn't really like it\nteacher: Ah, that's an interesting one! How did you like it?\nteacher: Why not?\nstudent: I don't like that it is really cruel\nstudent: especially Taras\nteacher: Yes!\nteacher: He killed his son, didn't he?\nstudent: and his relationships with his wife, the thing I hate the most\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Oh really? What happened with his wife, remind me please\nstudent: He didn't hear her, he didn't even try to listen to her. She asked him not to take his sons with him to Sech, she was crying, because they only just came home from the bursa (school)\nteacher: Oh, but he didn't listen to her because she was only a woman?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Yes, this is horrible, but a good reminder of what life was like for women for most of history!\nteacher: To be honest, I stopped reading 'old' authors because, like yourself, I find it very upsetting to read about how powerless women used to be!\nstudent: yeah!\nteacher: I prefer to read modern authors, especially female\nteacher: But you don't have this luxury because you have to read for school, don't you?\nstudent: at least there is not as much sexism in women's books as in men's\nteacher: Yes, definitely!\nteacher: Did you read Taras Bulba for your literature class at school?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: I hated Taras Bulba too, by the way. All these descriptions of people killed, very cruel like you say\nteacher: Did you tell you teacher that you didn't like it?\nteacher: *your\nstudent: in my essay\nteacher: Well done! :)\nstudent: hehe\nstudent: well the only thing I loved about him was that he is very smart\nstudent: sorry for the typos\nteacher: no worries\nteacher: Was he smart? I can't remember!\nstudent: he could get anything he wanted\nteacher: I see! Would you say he was quite cunning?\nstudent: yeah\nteacher: Ok, cool. Let\nteacher: Let's go back to what you read about the brain last time. Do you remember what that article said? In a few words\nstudent: about dopamine, how teenagers' brain is different and about brain cells\nstudent: and hemispheres\nteacher: Yes, that's right, dopamine\nteacher: Our mission of today is to put some bits of information we know about teenagers into a small article, 'What a teenager wants the world to know about them'\nteacher: For example\nteacher: 1. Teenagers need more sleep than adults. Moreover, they often need to sleep in the morning and feel awake at night, sometimes until late at night. It is very important to let a young person get enough sleep.\nteacher: That's my idea.\nteacher: We've got an article and you, a brand new teenager as of Emily Smith!\nstudent: heh\nteacher: What would you like the world (maybe adults) to know?\nteacher: *the article, I mean the text about the brain\nstudent: Adults should stop grounding kids for their marks\nteacher: Ok! Good one! Why?))\nstudent: Bad marks don't mean that your child is stupid\nteacher: Cool, go on!\nstudent: omg my Ipad just came\nteacher: OMG!\nstudent: with delivery\nteacher: I'll do you a deal. You don't look at your new ipad for 25 minutes and I don't look at my new book :)\nteacher: You chose the ipad then? not the iphone?\nstudent: yeah\nstudent: okay\nteacher: :)\nteacher: Bad marks ___ mean that your child is stupid\nstudent: don't\nteacher: Yes!\nteacher: And even if they were stupid, how can grounding help with that? :))\nstudent: yeah\nstudent: that's your child's life, he or she chooses\nteacher: What do they choose?\nteacher: By the way, you can just refer to a child as 'they'. But he or she is good too\nstudent: okie\nteacher: It's important to leave room to make mistakes (and get bad marks). Nobody is perfect.\nteacher: That's my idea, to add to yours maybe\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Ok! That's a very good point. Another point?\nstudent: Parents must not beat their children\nteacher: Bite? like a dog?\nstudent: that's awful and that won't help\nstudent: oy\nstudent: not bite\nstudent: hit\nteacher: hit? beat?\nstudent: hit\nteacher: Yes, definitely! This is a crime!\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Parents must not hit (without to, right? no to after must)\nstudent: If you want to educate your kid, you need to educate yourself, because children are little mirrors of you\nstudent: okie\nstudent: okie\nteacher: Exactly. Parents need to lead by example\nteacher: And hitting is not education, it's violence!\nstudent: yesss\nteacher: Ok, that's a very important point. Anything you'd like to add?\nstudent: hmm\nstudent: Parents should explain why something is bad to their kid, not just forbid\nteacher: Ok, sure. Why is that?\nstudent: The kid will want it much more then, and secretly they can for example dye their hair\nteacher: Ok, I see! We say it becomes a 'forbidden fruit'. Something that is forbidden becomes even more desirable\nteacher: Why is an explanation better then?\nstudent: Then the child can understand why it would be bad for them, and they will choose\nteacher: Yes, exactly. But then all that dopamine will make them do risky things!\nteacher: Ok, Sophia. It's been lovely (and very interesting!) to talk to you. I'll let you go and enjoy your new iPad! Will same time next week suit you?\nstudent: thank you, bye!\nteacher: Bye! :)",
    "student: Hello\nteacher: Hi Emily!\nstudent: Sorry for being late... again\nteacher: Don't worry! Thanks for accommodating my constant tweaking of the timetable\nstudent: No problem at all\nstudent: When will they lift the lockdown?\nteacher: I hope we'll be ablet to stick to a more permanent time from the next week on\nteacher: They are talking about March 8\nstudent: I'm fine with constant changes. I've been living like that for a loong t time haha\nstudent: Oh no, so the whole of February (\nstudent: Is it so bad with the Covid cases in there?\nteacher: Schools might start to return then. Fortunately, we're in the middle of nowhere here and the infection rate is a bit lower than in cities, so I really hope schools will open\nteacher: Yes, the UK has been really badly hit, a very very high death toll :(\nstudent: I can only imagine what strain it is on working parents.\nstudent: So sad\nteacher: Yes, indeed! Luckily, I only work part-time (flexibly, really), but I can't imagine how full-timers cope. And we're supposed to homeschool too!\nstudent: How do you like homeschooling? Do you share this chore with Mr. David Bennett?\nteacher: Yes, he does the math and I do the phonics\nteacher: Phonics are a slightly weird way to teach children to read\nteacher: You know, because English pronunciation is so irregular\nstudent: Never heard of it\nstudent: Oh yes. I know )))\nteacher: For example, children don't learn the alphabet, they learn the sounds /a/, /b/, /k/ etc.\nteacher: Phonemes, basically\nstudent: Spanish is a breeze compared to English\nstudent: In terms of pronunciation\nteacher: And they also learn 'tricky words' that make no sense at all :)\nteacher: Yes, so many languages are!\nstudent: That makes sense to me.\nstudent: Why don't they teach Phonics here in Ukraine I wonder\nteacher: Again, we're lucky that Sophia's in the first year (it's called Reception as opposed to year 1, which is next year)\nteacher: Older children are expected to do 3-5 hours of homeschooling. Crazy!!\nteacher: a day\nstudent: Oh my\nteacher: Phonics would really work with Ukrainian, wouldn't they?\nstudent: My cousin's son is a 2d grader\nstudent: They spend up to 4 hours a day\nstudent: They used to, actually,\nteacher: Goodness! Which country is it?\nstudent: Now that the lockdown has been lifted, they can go to school again\nstudent: Ukraine\nteacher: Ah right\nteacher: Are there any restrictions still in place? What's the infection level like?\nstudent: The infection level is pretty low. Around 3k per day\nteacher: Is that in the whole country? Or in Kyiv?\nstudent: The whole country\nstudent: Let me double check for you\nstudent: So today it's 3285 cases\nteacher: That's really good! Well done Ukraine!\nstudent: What are the numbers in Britain?\nteacher: It's around 20 thousand in the UK, and that's much better than a few weeks ago!\nteacher: It was over 40 thousand new cases every day at the beginning of the year!\nstudent: Same in Germany I was told\nstudent: Is it appropriate to react 'Shame' in this case?\nstudent: Meaning \u0436\u0430\u043b\u044c\nteacher: Yes, of course. It is a shame!\nstudent: I know there's 'Pity' and there's 'Shame'\nstudent: not the words themselves but the reactions\nteacher: I don't think there's a difference between them, actually\nstudent: and I find it hard to place them in my head\nstudent: Oh really?\nstudent: So basically they are synonymous ?\nteacher: I don't think there is! Such a shame / what a pity!\nteacher: Yes, I would say so\nstudent: Thank you! It has been bugging me for ages\nstudent: )))\nteacher: Obviously, 'shame on' you is different. The favourite expression of my school English teacher...\nstudent: That's why! Yes\nstudent: Shame on you! -- my school teacher used this one frequently too\nteacher: Ahh, schools. Such a lovely environment, full of shaming and hate :))\nstudent: Overcome, adapt, survive\nteacher: Is it in the Czech language (or Polish?) that 'pozor' also means 'what a pity'? It's always fascinated me, I don't know what the connection is\nstudent: The three words that should be written on all of their banners\nstudent: Instead of Latin\nteacher: Haha, yes!\nstudent: I've never heard about pozor. What an insight\nteacher: I'll have to check later on which language it is. One of the western Slavic ones!\nteacher: Ok, what shall we do today? Writing???\nstudent: Did you know that sklep is a store in Polish?\nstudent: Always made me laugh\nteacher: Yes!! That's so weird\nstudent: My google says pozor is appearance in Polish\nstudent: which is as funny)))\nteacher: Appearance? Hmmm!\nstudent: pozory myl\u0105\nstudent: looks can be deceiving\nteacher: Wow, interesting\nteacher: Ah, I might have mislead you! I think it's Czech for 'watch out!'\nteacher: Like, pozor, you are going to step in a puddle!\nstudent: ahahaha\nstudent: still funny\nteacher: It must be from 'zor' as in 'vision', right?\nstudent: Right\nteacher: It is funny))\nteacher: Pozor! I'm going to ask you about writing again)))\nstudent: You know. I started a little\nstudent: and then I was interrupted. And then I decided to finish before the lesson\nstudent: Never finished. Pozor!\nteacher: Haha, what a familiar story!\nstudent: I decided to write a completely made-up story\nteacher: You know what, let's work with what you have, and you can finish now 'in real time' and then it's done!\nstudent: about me quitting smoking\nteacher: as is you sacred right!\nteacher: Perfect\nstudent: I'm afraid my notes are at home. Can I just finish it for next time?\nteacher: Have you got an outline? Introduction - paragraph 1 - paragraph 2 ... Or are you keeping it free flowing?\nteacher: Ah, I see, yes sure\nstudent: I prefer handwritten compositions\nstudent: Should I type it?\nteacher: Yes, please! Maybe you can email it to me before the next class?\nstudent: Sure!\nstudent: Thank you\nteacher: Also, it's good to practise for the type of exam you're going to sit (paper-based / computer-based)\nstudent: Right!\nteacher: I've never done a computer-based exam but I suspect it's better for writing because people generally type faster than they write\nteacher: And its's easier to go back and alter the text, without crossing things out\nteacher: You know, another phobia from school You've crossed it out! Shame on you! :)))\nstudent: Oh yes! )\nstudent: A spellchecker would also help\nstudent: I'm sure it's not allowed though\nteacher: Nooo, there won't be a spellchecker))\nstudent: Tough luck haha\nteacher: Yep\nteacher: Ok, have you got the Cambridge Grammar and Vocabulary book handy at all?\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: Lovely! The hard copy?\nstudent: Let me find the hard copy. It should be somewhere at school\nteacher: Yes, sure\nstudent: got it\nteacher: Great. Ok, I'm looking at a chapter about passives. I suggest skipping the theory, going straight to practice and troubleshooting as and when\nteacher: I'll give you the page number in a sec\nstudent: Sure\nteacher: The first exercise is interesting. It's newspaper headlines, or 'breaking news' format, which means they are not full sentences\nstudent: Just a sec, I'll erase some stuff\nteacher: For example, instead of 'Biden has been declared the President' it would be 'Biden declared President'\nteacher: Yes, sure\nteacher: p. 35\nteacher: Oh no, ignore me! They are full sentences, actually :)\nstudent: Can you believe it. No eraser in the whole school\nstudent: Arrrghhh\nteacher: Have you got answers written there?\nstudent: Yes((\nteacher: Oh no! The pdf maybe?\nstudent: Ok I'll just ignore what's written\nstudent: ex1 right??\nteacher: Yes, that's right!\nteacher: If you just type the bits that you're putting in gaps here\nstudent: Ok\nstudent: were charged?\nteacher: No, the leg-irones are a device\nstudent: could soon be fitted\nteacher: yes!\nstudent: being considered\nteacher: that's right)\nstudent: A very strange sentence actually\nteacher: The first one?\nstudent: I can't see any connection between the 1st and the 2nd part\nstudent: Yes. Number 1\nteacher: Ah ok. The police are considering plans to introduce leg-irons.\nstudent: 2) being caused\nteacher: yes!\nstudent: Yes. I got the meaning. I was puzzled by the grammar side of it.\nteacher: Yes, very interesting! Very news-report style, beloved by CPE\nstudent: *by the grammar side of it\nstudent: Oh right. The news\nteacher: Well, the topic here is passives. Police are considering plans = plans are being considered\nstudent: 3) were charged\nteacher: They could fit leg-irons = leg irons could be fitted\nteacher: yes to 'were charged'!\nstudent: , under plans being considered by chief constable\nstudent: This part.\nstudent: Why 'under'?\nteacher: Oh I see! according to plans\nteacher: under plans = good expression\nteacher: like under the circumstances\nstudent: 4) has finally been elected\nteacher: Yes, finally! Haven't we all been waiting for it?\nstudent: Is it OK that they skipped the 'of'?\nstudent: Like in under plans of being\nstudent: sorry 'of'\nteacher: Aha, let's go back for a sec. Police are considering plans = plans are being considered\nstudent: 5) to be printed, is expected, is auditioned\nteacher: Now we get rid of the 'are', because we're using 'being considered' as a description\nteacher: under plans (which plans?) being considered...\nteacher: Yes, that's right!\nstudent: Finally got it\nstudent: Thank you\nstudent: 6) has been held, is deemed\nteacher: Yes, that's right. 'is deemed' is a great expression for formal writing, earns you nice CPE brownie points\nstudent: Will try to use it in my composition haha\nteacher: Ah, I've got to let you go! For the following weeks, do you prefer morning or lunchtime classes?\nstudent: Lunchtime\nteacher: I actually think an imaginary situation is a good choice for the writing because you don't get carried away by personal stuff and can invent as much or as little as you need for the word count :)\nstudent: Sorry again for being late. Let's hope with lunchtime I'll be more punctual\nstudent: I agree!\nteacher: Noted, I'll message you with some slots tomorrow! Don't worry, life has a way!\nstudent: You can think of anything in the world\nstudent: Thank you very much for the lesson!\nteacher: Exactly! Mind you, for some this is precisely the problem))\nteacher: It's my pleasure! Have a lovely day!\nstudent: You too!\nteacher: Bye! :)",
    "teacher: Hi Samantha Smith!\nteacher: Here I am, sorry!\nstudent: Hi!\nstudent: It's ok! I needed some time too\nteacher: Good :)\nstudent: Today I'm with Emily at home\nteacher: How are you today?\nstudent: Fine, thank you\nteacher: Oh I see! Has the nanny cancelled?\nstudent: How are you? How is your neck?\nteacher: Much better, thank you! But now I've got to teach myself to sleep in a better position, which is really hard!\nstudent: No, no, she is here on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. So today the nanny is me ))\nstudent: Do you prefer to sleep on the back?\nteacher: Aah, of course, I'm with you! I'll try to offer you classes on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays then\nteacher: I sleep on my front, but I have to sleep on my side or my back!\nstudent: And you did\nteacher: Did I? Good))\nstudent: But I couldn't do yesterday because I had to take Emily to the doctor\nstudent: Not bring I think\nteacher: Right I see. Take\nteacher: Take Emily to the doctor\nstudent: Sure. Take\nteacher: Ok, just do what you can today then, if you need to stop early, no problem, ok?\nstudent: Ok! Thank you\nstudent: I think the lesson till 11 am will be ok )\nteacher: Ok, lovely\nstudent: We have to go to Nova Poshta with Emily to pick up her new book )\nteacher: Exciting!\nteacher: Do you go to bookshops sometimes or do you order books online?\nstudent: And I would like to do it before her lunch and the nap\nstudent: nap? Am I right?\nteacher: nap\nstudent: Yes! Nap\nteacher: :)\nstudent: I felt like something wrong )))))\nstudent: hahaha\nteacher: :))\nteacher: You were close!\nstudent: But I think nobody would understand me ))\nteacher: They might have questions))\nstudent: sure )\nstudent: So as you see I started to put down Emily to nap again\nstudent: It looks like she needs it\nteacher: Oh right, you stopped for a while, didn't you? Does she still go to bed pretty late at night then?\nstudent: But I don't like it that she started to go to bed later in the evening\nteacher: Yes, it's a difficult choice!\nstudent: When she doesn't have a nap it's ok, but when she has it she goes to bed later (\nteacher: Sure\nstudent: I don't like the schedule like this\nteacher: At least you get some time to yourself during the day. Or the nanny does :)\nstudent: But I feel she needs a nap\nstudent: Yes, you are right, but\nstudent: ok\nteacher: This is so 'cultural' too, weirdly. In the UK, a 3-year-old hardly ever naps, but in Ukraine they mostly do!\nstudent: I don't know the word\nstudent: like I 'razuchilas'\nteacher: you unlearned something?\nstudent: Yes\nstudent: I've unlearned to use her nap to do something )\nstudent: I feel like that )\nteacher: Maybe you just relax? That's important too!\nstudent: Yes, it's strange. I don't think that toddlers are different\nstudent: It looks more like different traditions\nteacher: Yes, exactly!\nstudent: you are right! To relax is the best option )\nteacher: And then children are expected to go to bed at 7 pm, which is nice\nteacher: :)\nstudent: I like it )\nstudent: but for me it's not very convenient either\nteacher: If a toddler is tired, they start to get grumpy\nteacher: Oh, then she doesn't see David?\nstudent: Our nanny works three days per week but from 8 am till 8 pm\nstudent: So if Emily goes to bed at 7 pm I won't see her before it\nteacher: I see the problem yes!\nstudent: Sometimes I come home at 7 pm, but usually it's 7:45-8 pm\nstudent: I mean when the nanny is here\nteacher: Ah, yes, I see!\nstudent: Ok\nstudent: about book\nstudent: *books\nstudent: Usually I order them online\nstudent: We try to avoid shops now\nstudent: Especially big malls\nteacher: Yes, sure. We buy most things online now too, but I try not to buy books from Amazon because, you know, the ex-owner of Amazon is the richest man in the world. Surely, he doesn't need my money\nstudent: haha\nstudent: I see\nteacher: But it's hard because they are cheaper on Amazon!\nteacher: than at 'indie' bookshops\nstudent: We have a big online book shop Yakaboo here in Ukraine\nstudent: They do a very fast and cheap delivery\nteacher: Ah yes, I remember\nstudent: But books are more expensive there\nteacher: than at shops?\nstudent: So I try to buy from smaller online shops\nstudent: It's cheaper but I still need to pay more for the delivery via Nova Poshta\nteacher: I see, interesting! It's the other way round in Ukraine then\nteacher: Oh, have you had a chance to watch the video about cars?\nstudent: But I feel like I help small businesses)\nstudent: sorry\nstudent: businesses\nteacher: Yes, exactly!\nstudent: Yes! I've watched it!\nteacher: Ok, can you tell me in a few words what it is about?\nstudent: It's about the future )\nstudent: There is a plan to use electric cars by 2030\nstudent: it's quite an ambitious plan but still\nteacher: Yes, it's an ambitious plan! Good expression\nstudent: And big car companies aren't sure that it will be easy\nstudent: ok\nteacher: Well, they plan to ban the sales of new petrol / diesel cars, but if you already own one, you can still drive it!\nteacher: Also, there is a huge market of used cars in the UK. People will be able to buy a used petrol car, but not a new one\nstudent: yes!\nteacher: And what are some of the problems that the owners of electric cars might face now?\nstudent: ok\nstudent: they need more charge points\nteacher: Yes, definitely!\nstudent: something else?\nstudent: I remember the woman who was talking about charge points )\nteacher: That's the main thing, really. I read that a new battery has been invented that can be charged within 5 minutes\nstudent: wow\nteacher: Because, you know, if you are on a motorway and run out of battery, you have to find a charge point and charge for several hours\nteacher: Which is not as good as filling the car with petrol!\nteacher: But the technology is here, it just needs to become widespread\nstudent: I know that now it's the most difficult thing about electric cars, to find a charge point and to spend enough time on charging\nteacher: Big car companies ____ sure it will be easy (sure is an adjective)\nstudent: are sure?\nteacher: Yes! Some people might charge it at home or in their garage, but for that they need ___-____ parking\nteacher: Yes, or 'aren't sure' in this case\nstudent: off-street\nstudent: *off-street\nteacher: correct!\nstudent: Ah! sure! They aren't sure!\nteacher: Have you guys got off-street parking?\nstudent: we have a big car park here in our building\nteacher: Oh, a big car park? Underground?\nstudent: I'm not sure that it's exactly off-street parking )\nstudent: Yes! Underground!\nstudent: So is it called a car park?\nteacher: Yes, it's called a car park. Off-street / on-street parking is more of a situation\nstudent: of a situation?\nteacher: But the place is a car park. You can have your own 'parking spot' at a car park\nteacher: Sorry, I'll try to explain better\nstudent: Ah! I see now\nstudent: So we have a parking spot which we rent from the owner\nstudent: it's too expensive to buy\nstudent: too\nteacher: I remember, you said!\nstudent: Ah, right! )\nteacher: On-street parking means parking your vehicle on the street, anywhere on or along the curb of streets, in contrast to parking it in a parking garage. In some streets you can always park your vehicle on the street, but sometimes there are restrictions. Mostly these restrictions are presented on traffic signs. Sometimes you\u2019re only allowed to park on one side of the street, and sometimes you\u2019re not allowed to park your vehicle at all.\nstudent: I see\nteacher: This is a piece from the website about parking rules :)\nstudent: I see, it's not your style of explanation ))))\nteacher: That's right))\nteacher: But you can still say, for example, this house has off-street parking (which means there is a driveway probably)\nteacher: Estate agents especially like to say this\nstudent: No garage but the place for a car\nteacher: I think it's a bit hard to explain because in Ukraine off-street parking is usually a garage or a car park, but here it's often a driveway because many people live in houses\nstudent: I see\nteacher: Yes, check out this picture, for example\nstudent: I remember it from my visit to York\nstudent: Mike's parents had it I think\nstudent: I mean a driveway\nteacher: Yes, many people have it! I don't know if the link works, but if you just google 'a driveway' you can see the images\nstudent: Yes! Thank you\nteacher: I know you've been to London loads, I don't know what the situation is like in the city centre, there are probably car parks\nstudent: I even found 'Why Choose Resin Over Other Driveway Materials?' for your driveway )\nteacher: Yes!! We get a lot of ads for driveways))))\nstudent: )))\nteacher: I think by resin they mean this tennis court sort of cover, do you know what I mean?\nstudent: I see\nteacher: I've got to let you go pick up Emily's new book!\nstudent: They have a picture )\nstudent: Thank you\nstudent: See you tomorrow )\nteacher: And I'll talk to you tomorrow! That's right, have a lovely day!\nstudent: bye xx\nteacher: Bye :)\nstudent: You too! )",
    "student: Hello\nteacher: Hello Samantha Smith!\nteacher: Happy New Year!\nstudent: Thanks!\nteacher: Are you having a nice holiday?\nstudent: In China, the New Year is the most important holiday.\nteacher: Yes, I know!\nstudent: There are still ten days before the Chinese New Year.\nteacher: Oh sorry! I thought it had already started!\nstudent: But I can't go home.\nteacher: How are you going to celebrate in this case?\nteacher: Oh really? Is your hometown still in lockdown?\nstudent: Not in lockdown, but in China, the pandemic control policy is strict.\nstudent: If I go home, I must stay at home.\nteacher: I remember you said there was an outbreak in your town\nteacher: Ah, I see now\nstudent: Yes, a month ago it was serious in my hometown.\nteacher: Oh, I'm so sorry to hear you can't go and see your family!\nstudent: We have lost a lot of freedom during the pandemic.\nstudent: This is the first year that I'm not in my hometown during the Chinese New Year.\nstudent: But it's OK.\nteacher: Yes, it's a similar situation here. We are still in a strict nationwide lockdown. It might be lifting in March\nteacher: Yes, really sad and frustrating! What are you going to do instead? Are you planning to cook any festive food?\nstudent: I don't cook well. So I think I will see my friends.\nstudent: We are free in Beijing.\nteacher: Sounds good! Do you normally exchange presents at New Year?\nstudent: In China during the New Year, we only give gifts to older people, like uncles and aunts.\nstudent: And the elder relatives will give money to children.\nteacher: Oh interesting! So you would give presents to your parents, but they won't give any presents to you?\nteacher: Oh yes, the red envelope, right?\nstudent: Yes.\nteacher: Yes, I remember\nstudent: it's called ya sui qian\nteacher: Sure, yes\nstudent: In China, they think money can keep you from getting older.\nteacher: Money can keep you from getting older?\nstudent: Maybe it means: press your age\nteacher: Hmm, I don't understand, sorry\nstudent: In the old Chinese culture, haha\nteacher: I see, interesting!\nstudent: Also the Chinese New Year came from a myth.\nstudent: Year is an ancient monster.\nstudent: Hello, Miss Rodriguez.\nteacher: I remember when we were in Shanghai, the city got almost empty during the Chinese New Year. I wonder if Beijing is going to be the same! Or maybe people are not allowed to leave this year\nteacher: Hello, I'm here\nteacher: Is everyone banned from travelling this year?\nstudent: Yes. Beijing is the same.\nstudent: Not everyone , but this year a lot of people will stay in Beijing.\nteacher: I see, yes. It was the same with London, people couldn't go see their families\nteacher: We usually go see my in-laws for Christmas but we didn't last Christmas because we were not allowed to travel\nteacher: If we had been allowed to travel, we would have gone to see my parents-in-law.\nteacher: Remember this structure? We talked about last time, third conditional\nstudent: Yes.\nteacher: If had V3, would have V3\nteacher: Do you know what I mean by V3? The third form of the verb. Write-wrote-written (written is the third form)\nstudent: Yes.\nteacher: Yes, and we use it to talk about things that we imagine could have gone differently in the past\nteacher: like 'If I hadn't lived in China, I wouldn't have learned to use chopsticks'\nteacher: I think was the example\nstudent: If we had the vaccine for the pandemic, we would not be in lockdown.\nteacher: If we had the vaccine for the pandemic, we would not be in lockdown, yes!\nteacher: but this about the present, isn't it? So it's second conditional\nteacher: an unreal situation in the present\nstudent: Yes, sorry.\nteacher: And you were (mostly) right with the grammar\nteacher: No, don't apologize, this is very good\nteacher: (Hasn't China got the vaccine now though?)\nteacher: Ok, here's an example. Could you make a third conditional please?\nteacher: If you  (not/be) late, we  (not/miss) the bus.\nstudent: If you had not been late, we would have caught the bus.\nteacher: Ah, nearly! catch-caught-caught\nteacher: we would have caught\nteacher: But you've got the right idea\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: If she  (study) she  (pass) the exam.\nstudent: If she had studied hard, she would have passed the exam.\nteacher: The second part is perfect, but the first... If she __ ___ hard\nstudent: had studied\nteacher: had studied\nteacher: Study is a regular verb, and the three forms are study-studied-studied\nteacher: Ok, one more!\nteacher: We (see) John if we (arrive) earlier.\nstudent: We would have seen John if we had arrived earlier.\nteacher: Nearly! if we had arrived earlier\nteacher: This sentence shows that the 'if...' part doesn't have to be at the beginning :)\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: Ok, let's do another one\nteacher: If they  (go) to bed early, they  (not/wake) up late.\nstudent: If they had gone to bed early, they would not have woken up late.\nteacher: they wouldn't have woken up late, but yes!\nteacher: You got all the verbs right :)\nteacher: Did they wake up late or early then?\nstudent: Recently I always wake up early.\nteacher: Yes, you work long hours, don't you? But in this sentence, do we know if they woke up later or early? 'If they had gone to bed early, they wouldn't have woken up late'\nteacher: Sorry, have I confused you?\nstudent: Sorry, so this sentence is not right?\nteacher: No, no, it's correct!\nteacher: I'm just asking how you understand it\nteacher: They woke up late, didn't they?\nstudent: We don't know if they woke up late.\nstudent: In this sentence, I think I know they woke up late.\nteacher: Yes, exactly!\nteacher: Because someone is probably unhappy about it and is saying, if they had gone to bed early, they wouldn't have woken up late!\nstudent: Oh, I understand what you mean.\nteacher: Yes, good, we understand it in the same way then :)\nteacher: Lovely. I'm going to tell you a short story, and then ask a couple of questions about who caused the problem, and you can make nice third conditional sentences, ok?\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: The story is about a musician called Antonio. He lives in a small fishing village. He wanted to marry his girlfriend Barbara and went to her father to ask him.\nteacher: But her father was a serious fisherman. He said that Antonio had to get a boat and then he could marry Barbara. No boat for fishing, no Barbara\nteacher: Antonio didn't have a boat and he didn't have much money. He went to his friend Chris and asked him to lend him his boat.\nteacher: But Chris said that he couldn't. Chris was a fisherman, he needed his boat for fishing every day.\nteacher: So Antonio and Barbara broke up. Then Antonio met this girl Elizabeth and asked her to marry him.\nteacher: But Elizabeth said he was still in love with Barbara and refused.\nteacher: Antionio was unmarried and unhappy. Whose fault do you think it is?\nstudent: If Antonio had had a boat for fishing or had had the money to buy a boat, he would have married Barbara.\nteacher: Yes, nearly! The verb is 'have', so you need had + the third form of the verb\nteacher: If Antonio had had a boat...\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: Ok, cool! What about Barbara's father?\nteacher: Do you think he did the right thing?\nstudent: If Barbara's father had not asked Antonio to have a boat, Antonio would have married Barbara.\nteacher: Yes, perfect :)\nteacher: What about his friend Chris? Surely Christ should have helped him?\nteacher: sorry, Crhis\nteacher: Chris!\nstudent: If Chris had lent Antonio a boat, Barbara's father would have agreed that Antonio could marry his daughter.\nteacher: Ah, very nice third conditional, yes!\nteacher: What about Barbara?\nstudent: If Barbara had not broken up with Antonio, they would have got married.\nteacher: Ah, it's time! If you'd like to practice some more, feel free to write more sentences, about Barbara and Elizabeth for example, and email them to me to check, ok?\nteacher: Yes, good one!\nstudent: OK\nteacher: Would the same next week suit you? Also on Thursday\nstudent: Yes!\nteacher: Lovely! When the lockdown is finished here, I'll be able to offer you 2 classes a week again, but it'll have to be just one for now\nteacher: Have a nice weekend, I'll speak to you next Thursday!\nstudent: OK.\nstudent: Bye bye\nteacher: Bye :)",
    "student: Hi Mr. Williams!\nstudent: How are you?\nteacher: Morning!\nteacher: Fine, thank you. And how are you?\nstudent: I'm ok, thank you\nstudent: At home, but with the nanny ))\nteacher: Are you hiding in your bedroom? :)\nstudent: yes )\nteacher: Cool :)\nteacher: Have you got any nice plans for the weekend?\nstudent: Yes, we have\nteacher: Ooh, what are you going to do? I'm going to live through you :)\nstudent: We are going to meet with Emma and Sophia (and Emily) in the park\nstudent: haha live through me )) It's nice. Sounds like a movie.\nstudent: Julia doesn't meet other children very often now\nteacher: Yes, the full expresson is 'to live vicariously through someone'\nstudent: And we would like to show her Sophia )) haha\nteacher: For example, some parents live vicariously through their children\nteacher: People in lockdown can live vicariously through their friends who are not in a lockdown :)\nstudent: haha\nteacher: Ok, Julia doesn't meet other children very often\nstudent: so 'meets not often' is not good phrase?\nstudent: I'm still afraid to let her go to the kindergarden\nteacher: Nooo, she doesn't meet ...\nteacher: Yes, I can see why!\nteacher: What are they saying about vaccines in Ukraine?\nstudent: So I signed one more application\nstudent: oh! Don't ask\nteacher: Oh really? That bad?\nstudent: They say that it's a hard process and they try\nstudent: doing all their best\nstudent: and bla bla bla\nstudent: So\nstudent: One of my French friends has published the information about vaccination in the whole world\nstudent: *world\nstudent: It's based on The Economist research\nstudent: So for Ukraine it's 2023\nstudent: the last country in Europe\nteacher: People will only be vaccinated by 2023?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Oh no :((( it's so sad!\nstudent: It's just the magazine research\nstudent: But I think it's quite plausible?\nstudent: Is it the right word? )\nteacher: Yes, this is a very good word!!\nstudent: I've googled it ))\nteacher: \u02c8pl\u0254\u02d0.z\u0259.b\u0259l\nteacher: Yes, 2023 sounds quite plausible, unfortunately\nstudent: yes (\nstudent: I'm quite tired of it\nstudent: from it? )\nteacher: I bet you are!\nteacher: of it\nstudent: I mean that now we don't have the lockdown but I'm still not sure if I can go to the restaurant or let Julia go to the kindergarten etc\nteacher: Yes, and it's hard to imagine this could continue for two more years\nstudent: When it's restricted you know that you have to follow the rules\nstudent: But when you have to choose it's sooo difficult (\nteacher: Yep, I know exactly what you mean!!\nstudent: Do you know Lyudmila Petranovska?\nstudent: She is a Russian therapist\nteacher: Yes, of course! I have a lot of respect for her work\nstudent: ok\nstudent: so\nstudent: I watched her webinar about children's development\nstudent: I'm not sure if I have the right translation )\nstudent: *watched\nteacher: it's the right translation!\nstudent: And she said that for children from 3 to 7 it's better to be in a group of children )\nstudent: And I've started to think about it and what I can to do now ))\nstudent: I hate these thoughts )\nstudent: you would like to do something but you can't\nteacher: Really? I'm surprised she said that\nstudent: Actually you can, but you are afraid because of the Covid risks\nstudent: Really? I'm surprised she said that  - yes! I think you told me it's from 5, isn't it?\nstudent: *isn't it?\nteacher: As you know, I've been studying developmental psychology, and Petranovskaya worked with the institute where I study\nstudent: Ah! Interesting\nstudent: She is like an expert there?\nteacher: She worked with the Russian campus, so I always thought their ideas were aligned\nstudent: aligned - same?\nstudent: I'm sorry Can you give me 2 mins?\nstudent: Just a small pause\nteacher: I don't think there is a definite age! It's nice for a child to have some friends, but the main idea is that they should have enough adults in her life. Julia is a very lucky girl, with her parents, her nanny, her grandparents, aunts, uncles and an older cousin :)\nteacher: Yes, if two or more things are aligned, they are in the same line. Remember we talked about the words aligned / misaligned? I can't remember what the topic was now!\nteacher: Yes, of course\nstudent: I'm here\nstudent: sorry )\nteacher: No problem\nstudent: Remember we talked about the words aligned / misaligned? - actually no ( sorry\nteacher: Sorry, it could have been with another student, I can't remember, one sec\nstudent: but the main idea is that they should have enough adults in her life. Julia is a very lucky girl, with her parents, her nanny, her grandparents, aunts, uncles and an older cousin :)  - oh, thank you! I like the idea and I feel better now ))\nstudent: feel\nteacher: If you put two things in a straight line, you align them /\u0259\u02c8la\u026an/\nstudent: Sorry, it could have been with another student, I can't remember, one sec  - maybe I've forgotten the word ) It could be me )\nteacher: Yoga instructors talk about alignment a lot. For example, your knee should be aligned with your second toe in some poses etc.\nstudent: I see\nteacher: And it can also mean 'agree'\nteacher: The country's leading intellectuals tend to be aligned with the opposition.\nteacher: an example from the dictionary\nteacher: The opposite is misaligned. If the wheels of a car are misaligned, it's not very nice to drive\nstudent: aha! Thank you\nteacher: Yes, speaking of children, I feel very lucky that Sophia is so young. He loves the lockdowns and just 'hanging out with mum and dad'. If he was a teenager, it would be a different story!\nstudent: \u042b\u0433\u043a\u0443\nstudent: Sure\nstudent: I can't imagine what to do with a teenager in the same situation )\nteacher: I know, it would be crazy! By March, Sophia will have been home 9 months out of 12!\nstudent: wow\nstudent: it's better not to think about it )\nteacher: Yes, the first lockdown started in March. Nearly 12 months\nstudent: I mean don't count )\nteacher: It's better not to think about it, yes\nstudent: Yeah! It's about a year since the first lockdown\nteacher: Ok, let's think about something fun! We started talking about bookshops last time\nstudent: Yes!\nteacher: Have you got a favourite bookshop? In Kyiv or abroad?\nstudent: hmm, it's a difficult question\nstudent: We don't have many bookshops here in Kiev\nstudent: there are lots of online bookshops\nstudent: But it's too expensive to rent a place for a shop here in Kyiv\nstudent: So usually the books in 'real' bookshops cost more and people prefer to buy them online\nteacher: Ah yes, it's easier for them to operate online then?\nteacher: Yes, I see!\nstudent: And bookshops are closing\nstudent: is it the right expression? I'm not sure\nteacher: That's a shame! And I suppose, if the rent is so expensive, they haven't got any space to put small cafes in bookshops, for example\nteacher: Yes, it is the right expression!\nstudent: So it's like a vicious circle\nstudent: a vicious circle\nteacher: Yes, another good expression :)\nstudent: I've googled it )\nteacher: Books are too expensive, people don't buy them and bookshops go out of business\nstudent: yes!\nteacher: Do many people read e-books?\nstudent: So we have several chains of bookshops\nstudent: Bukva'\nstudent: Bookling'\nstudent: Booking is more about English language books\nstudent: But I hate the service\nteacher: And most importantly, there is Petrivka :)))\nstudent: They never know what they have in the shop )))\nteacher: Oh, that's silly!\nstudent: And most importantly, there is Petrivka :)))  - Yes! But I haven't been there for 100 years )\nstudent: Can I say like this in English?\nteacher: Yes, you can!\nstudent: Mr. Williams : Oh, that's silly!  - yes! I know better than a shop assistant! I hate it )\nteacher: Yes, I think Petrivka is an equivalent of English independent book sellers\nteacher: I don't know the statistics, but I suspect most people in the UK buy books off Amazon. It's cheap, convenient and there is an almost unlimited choice.\nstudent: I see\nteacher: Then there are big chains like Waterstones (I'm sure you've seen Waterstones). They are nice, and the big ones have cafes and children departments are fun, children can play and read books there. There is a very nice one in Cambridge\nteacher: But just yesterday, I read something disappointing about how staff is treated at Waterstones! So we might buy less from them\nstudent: Wow, I like it. We need the same here\nteacher: We buy from Blackwells, their online service is very good and they are not Amazon!\nteacher: Yes, you'd love it! You should visit a big Waterstones next time you're in the UK\nteacher: And also, there are small independent bookshops (or small chains). Life is hard for them, but they sometimes have amazing books!\nstudent: Maybe it's a good idea for a business here in Kyiv\nteacher: sometimes antiquarian\nteacher: Maybe!!\nstudent: After the Covid era ))\nteacher: Yes, and I know who can do it :)\nstudent: I mean a cafe plus a bookshop plus some space for children\nteacher: Yes, perfect!\nteacher: In China there is a cafe in every bookshop!\nstudent: I like the idea\nteacher: People meet there, read together, hold club meetings etc.\nstudent: Because cafes are veeeery popular here\nteacher: And of course, if there's a cafe, you can invite bands / poets / musicians / writers to play / give talks\nstudent: Not now but before\nstudent: )\nteacher: Yes, Kyiv is full of quirky little cafes!\nstudent: I need to do some research )\nstudent: quirky? )\nteacher: Ok, just a few words, and I'll leave you with another video for homework\nstudent: ok!\nteacher: Yes, if something is quirky, it's unusual in an attractive way\nteacher: a quirky little cafe / bookshop\nstudent: ok! I see! Thank you!\nteacher: She likes to dress in a quirky way\nteacher: etc.\nteacher: a similar word that also means 'old-fashioned' is quaint\nteacher: unusual and old-fashioned\nstudent: ok!\nteacher: a quaint old cottage\nteacher: but quaint is not always positive\nteacher: If you say, 'What a quaint idea!', you don't approve of the idea\nstudent: aha!\nteacher: it's strange, maybe in an old-fashioned or bad way\nteacher: Ok, one more word!\nteacher: tumbleweed\nteacher: It's a plant. When it dies, it breaks off the ground and the wind rolls it around like a ball\nstudent: perekatipole )\nteacher: exactly :)\nteacher: Also, if you post something on the Internet, but there is not response and no likes, it's tumbleweed\nteacher: Like this plant rolls around in an empty space, with no people\nstudent: oh, interesting\nteacher: Or if a shop is empty, the owner (in the video) says, Tumbleweed!\nteacher: Like, this place is so empty\nstudent: ok! I see!\nteacher: And finally, forlorn\nteacher: and adjective that means 'sad and lonely'\nstudent: Thank you!\nteacher: /f\u0259\u02c8l\u0254\u02d0n/\nteacher: It's quite poetic :)\nstudent: )\nteacher: Ok, I'll send you the homework then! I hope you enjoy it, and we will speak again on Monday!\nstudent: Thank you!\nstudent: Have a good weekend!\nteacher: Have a lovely weekend :)\nteacher: Thank you\nstudent: bye bye xxx\nteacher: bye xx",
    "teacher: Hi Emily Smith! Are you here?\nstudent: Hi!\nstudent: How are you?\nstudent: I'm fine\nteacher: Great, thank you! My Internet was down and I couldn't log in, sorry, I hope you didn't wait long\nteacher: We're having a snow day today! And it's even settled!\nstudent: Oh! It's ok\nstudent: don't worry!\nstudent: settled?\nteacher: You know, when snow doesn't melt straightaway\nstudent: You mean that you have real snow on the ground? )\nstudent: We have loots of snow today\nteacher: Yes, we do! Surprisingly\nstudent: and it's falling now\nteacher: Oh really?\nstudent: falling and falling )\nstudent: The traffic is horrible already\nteacher: Ah, we're both having snow days then, but it's obviously not as exotic for you\nstudent: And I can imagine what we will have at the end of the day\nteacher: Oh, sorry to hear that! Yes, we can actually enjoy it because we don't have to go anywhere\nstudent: sorry\nstudent: one moment\nteacher: ok!\nstudent: ok\nstudent: Here I am )\nteacher: Lovely :)\nstudent: So\nstudent: Is Emily happy about the snow?\nstudent: the snow? )\nteacher: Oh yes! extremely!\nstudent: Actually we have a very funny thing\nstudent: For snowballs\nteacher: Yes, we can say 'the snow' in this case because it's not snow in general, it's today's snow\nstudent: It's a special tool for making snowballs\nstudent: it's funny for me because we didn't have such things in our childhood )\nteacher: Haha, nice! No, we didn't!\nstudent: it's today's snow ! I see! thank you!\nteacher: Did you manage to get the sledge from your brother's?\nstudent: Oh! Yes! And we've already used it several times\nstudent: Sophia is happy\nteacher: Nice! The kind of toys Emily definitely doesn't need :)\nstudent: Sometimes it's difficult to pull her on the sledge )\nteacher: I bet!\nstudent: One day we went to Nova Poshta with Sophia and we took the sledge\nstudent: *Nova Poshta\nteacher: I suppose you use a sledge instead of a pram in the winter :)\nstudent: And I noticed that some roads (dorozhki?) 'pochischeni'\nteacher: Some paths, if they are just footpaths\nstudent: So it was like an all-round competition )))\nteacher: Some paths have been cleared\nteacher: Oh I see, in a way you don't want clear paths!\nstudent: We walked for 3 minutes, then I pulled the sledge with Sophia for 1 minute\nstudent: and then another walk\nstudent: etc.\nstudent: ))))\nstudent: It was fun\nteacher: Haha, I see!\nstudent: But after it I felt quite tired )\nteacher: Yes, it sounds like a workout\nstudent: yes!! )\nteacher: Ok, have you had a chance to listen to the story of a quaint little bookshop?\nstudent: Yes! I have )\nstudent: I liked the video\nteacher: I'm glad you liked it :) Can you tell me in a few words what happened?\nstudent: Ok\nstudent: there is a bookshop\nstudent: which sells books, especially old books\nteacher: Yes, that's right\nstudent: And one day nobody visited it. So the owner posted a sad tweet about it\nstudent: And this tweet was spotted by a man who has lots of subscribers on Twitter\nstudent: And the man retwitted it\nstudent: Lots of people saw the tweet and wanted to buy books at the bookshop\nstudent: Some people even donated (to) the bookshop\nstudent: The situation became better and we have a happy end )\nteacher: Yes, indeed!\nteacher: Donated to is correct :)\nteacher: It's a bit confusing with Twitter. A post there is called a 'tweet', and the verb is to tweet\nstudent: ah, sorry\nteacher: you know, like a bird tweets\nteacher: no worries\nstudent: so Twitter, but tweet\nteacher: Yes, this shop got very lucky, didn't it? But not many of them are as lucky, lots of them go... (what's the word for being out of money)?\nstudent: I see!\nteacher: Yes, confusingly! Twitter but to tweet / a tweet\nstudent: Lots of them go bankrupt\nteacher: You know, they kept saying on the news 'President Trump tweeted...', but not anymore, thankfully!\nstudent: unfortunately\nteacher: Yes, exactly! They go bankrupt and go out of business\nstudent: hahaha\nstudent: it's about Trump )\nteacher: It's quite interesting that things got better for this shop after they complained :)) Usually you've got to do a bit of marketing, things like that\nstudent: How is our Mister Alas, actually?\nteacher: Haha, well, same old I think! Alas!\nstudent: haha ) ok )\nteacher: He's pretty proud of the vaccine rollout, so he's talking about that all the time\nstudent: rollout?\nstudent: like the speed of vaccination?\nteacher: Oh, if you have a new product or service and you start offering it to more and more people, this is the rollout of the product / service\nteacher: Here's an example from the dictionary: Since its rollout in fall of 1999, PayPal has gained millions of members.\nstudent: ok\nstudent: it looks like 'vnedrenie', doesn't it?\nteacher: So they are rolling out the vaccine\nteacher: Hmm, I guess so! maybe something else, I'm trying to think\nstudent: I've checked in the Cambridge Dictionary and the context reverso (?)\nteacher: It's like, first vaccines were offered in hospitals, then in GP practices, and now even in gyms and on stadiums, to offer them to more and more people\nstudent: they even have the word rollout in Russian\nteacher: Oh really? Haha, that's funny! I can't imagine it in Russian\nstudent: Like a marketing term I think\nstudent: I can write it for you\nstudent: \u0440\u043e\u043b\u043b\u0430\u0443\u0442 )\nteacher: I see, I suppose it means there isn't an exact equivalent in Russian\nstudent: haha\nteacher: Oh no, this looks awful!!\nteacher: :))\nstudent: hahaha )\nteacher: Ok, back to the bookshop for a moment! If you were an owner of a bookshop like this, what would you do? to save your business\nstudent: Oh, it's a difficult question\nstudent: More information about us on social media I think\nteacher: One sec\nstudent: More pictures\nteacher: Hmm, maybe one of my students got their time wrong and entered the chatroom\nstudent: More information about us\nteacher: not sure what it was\nteacher: Yes, definitely\nteacher: I think a location is really important for a shop like this\nstudent: I would find the information about our old clients and send them some messages that we are open and welcome them\nteacher: For example, York town centre that you probably know very well is full of independent shops like this\nstudent: I don't remember it well but I agree\nstudent: )\nteacher: People go to York, get inspired by all the history and want to go browse antiquarian books for hours\nstudent: well\nstudent: go browse?\nteacher: Otherwise, not everyone has the time to browse!\nstudent: like to search?\nteacher: Oh, that's a good word, browse! When you go to a shop, and you're looking at different things\nteacher: probably without buying very much!\nteacher: Or you can browse through a book / magazine. Look at some pictures, read this and that, but not properly\nteacher: And of course, we browse the Internet! And that's why we've got Internet browsers like Microsoft Explorer, Google Chrome\nteacher: What is it you Apple people have? Safari? :)\nstudent: Yes! Safari is awful )\nteacher: Really? But you can use Google Chrome surely?\nstudent: Yes, I can\nstudent: The problem is that lots of software is made on the Google platform so it works well in Chrome but doesn't work in Safari\nstudent: Actually it works but with some errors )\nstudent: So sometimes I use Google Chrome\nteacher: Ah, I see! I'm actually rebelling against Google a little bit\nstudent: I have to )\nteacher: Do you 'to rebel'?\nstudent: Ok, rebelling? ))\nstudent: No, I don't\nstudent: I mean I don't know the word )\nteacher: Sorry, I've been looking for a transcription\nteacher: /r\u026a\u02c8bel/\nteacher: the stress is on the second syllable\nteacher: it means 'to fight against the government / to disobey rules'\nteacher: If you liked Star Wars, it would be easy to give you an example, but you don't :))\nstudent: ok, let's try )\nteacher: a person who rebels is a rebel (stress on the first syllable)\nteacher: \u02c8reb.\u0259l\nteacher: Teenagers often rebel against their parents!\nstudent: vosstanie?\nteacher: Well, in Star Wars there's an evil empire and heroic rebels :)\nteacher: Yes, vosstanie is a rebellion!\nteacher: And if a rebellion is successful, we call that a revolution :)\nstudent: rebels - povstantsi )\nteacher: like Maidan\nteacher: Yes, indeed!\nstudent: ok!\nstudent: About indeed\nteacher: So I'm rebelling against Google that collects too much personal information\nteacher: I'm using Ecosia as a search engine instead, and it uses the profits from searches for different eco projects, mainly planting trees!\nteacher: But the browser is still Google Chrome\nteacher: Yes, please! What about indeed?\nstudent: I remember how Emily asked a speaker of  Russian not to use indeed because, according to him, nobody can use it correctly if they are not English native speakers )\nteacher: Ha, well, I'm sure that's not true!!\nstudent: I'm using Ecosia as a search engine instead, and it uses the profits from searches for different eco projects, mainly planting trees!  - Wow! I've never heard about it\nstudent: *speaking\nteacher: It's as good as Google I would say\nstudent: nobody can\nteacher: yep, good corrections\nteacher: Oh Emily!\nstudent: Maybe I'll try it!\nteacher: :)\nteacher: Yes, give it a go!\nteacher: Ok, what new words have we had today?\nteacher: to rebel / a rebel / a rebellion\nstudent: How is Emily? Have you heard from him?\nteacher: for example, a teenage rebellion\nteacher: I haven't heard anything from him for a few years now!\nstudent: to rebel / a rebel / a rebellion - yes!\nteacher: Twitter / a tweet / to tweet\nstudent: yes!\nteacher: to browse at a shop / through a book\nstudent: yes! )\nteacher: Oh, and the rollout of a product / service\nstudent: yes! ))\nteacher: Ok, I'm going to leave you with these words then. Enjoy the snow, and hope it won't cause too many problems!\nstudent: Thanks!\nstudent: I liked the lesson!\nteacher: I'm glad :)\nstudent: Have a good afternoon )\nstudent: Bye xx\nteacher: Our next class is Wednesday 10 am, right?\nteacher: Thank you, you too!\nstudent: Yes! )\nteacher: Lovely! Take care :)",
    "student: Hi Emily Johnson!\nteacher: Hi Jessica!\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: Fine thank you :) How about you?\nteacher: Good, thank you! We're having a cold spell, the temperature hasn't been rising above zero even in the daytime\nteacher: And it's been snowing, yay!\nstudent: I have heard about it, yes :) Here it is also cold, but it should get colder at the end of the week...\nteacher: Any snow at all?\nstudent: It sprinkled some snow yesterday, but nothing remained on the ground...\nstudent: apart from that, this year it has snowed at least once a week...I am looking forward to spring!\nteacher: That's a shame. Here it finally settled, I don't think I've actually experienced having snow for more than 2 hours in this country\nteacher: Ah, I see, it's not an oddity for you then. Oh me too, I'm fed up with the winter, but it's nice when it's actually properly cold\nteacher: Rather than damp and grey\nstudent: Haha...that's true..\nstudent: I have been told that winters in Graz are usually damp and grey...but this one is much more snowy and cold...\nteacher: I just thought, I've got to cover my beautiful Italian artichokes as they're giving out -8 at night tomorrow\nteacher: Yes, it's the result of that atmospheric Arctic warming... or stratospheric? What was the term?\nteacher: Anyway, it's a phenomenon that's taking place this year and that means Arctic air is being pushed down south\nteacher: as I understand\nstudent: Yes...I think both are okay: the stratosphere is a part of the armosphere...\nteacher: A sudden stratoshperic warming is the term apparently\nstudent: which is probably the one more involved in this...but yes, with -8 you green garden is at risk...\nteacher: It'll be ok, it's hardy! Except for the artichokes I reckon\nteacher: Ooh, has the lockdown been eased as you expected?\nstudent: Yes..somewhat...now 2 families can meet and some shops are open...\nstudent: but you need to wear an FFP2 mask and, for certain places (e.g. hairdresser), need a negative test\nstudent: so the overall effect isn't that noticeable\nteacher: A negative test for hairdresser's?? Tough!\nteacher: Oh, like a medical grade mask? Is it because of the more transmittable variant of the virus?\nstudent: Yes...the FFP2 are the filtering medical masks, those that doctors use...they should be able to filter the virus, protecting both you and who is around you...\nteacher: Yes, tough but necessary. They are talking about requiring these masks on the tube in London\nstudent: I see...here they are very wary of the UK variant and that's one of the reasons why they imposed this kind of masks...but I don't know how much people follow this: the other day I went to a mechanic for a check and nobody was wearing anything...\nstudent: until they saw me with a mask...\nteacher: Yes, this 'love of freedom' is our downfall in my opinion\nteacher: In this particular case\nteacher: Well, the UK is now wary of the South African variant, which the vaccines might not work so well against\nstudent: Indeed...I believe that people don't realize the problem because the negative effect is too distant from the wrong behaviour...\nstudent: yep, I have also heard of that mutation..anyhow vaccines should at least protect against severe complications of the South African variant...but I really hope they will speed up the vaccination programs\nteacher: Yes, I hope so too! I\nteacher: Ok, I wonder today if you'd be curious to try your hand at a couple of Cambridge English Proficiency tasks. Have you heard of this exam?\nstudent: I have heard of it...and it is one of those things that I would like to do at one point in my life...\nstudent: so I am curious, indeed, to tackle these tasks.\nteacher: Great! This is the highest level exam, formerly known as CPE\nteacher: Unlike IELTS, the certificate hasn't got an expiry date, so this indeed might be a good aim / motivator for students of your level\nteacher: The exam consists of a reading+use of English, writing, speaking and listening parts.\nstudent: I think it would also be a good opportunity for a thorough review of my English...the only thing I am currently missing is the time to study.\nteacher: I suggest having a go at reading and use of English today. Could you check your email, please? I sent you a sample paper\nstudent: Okay, I have opened it\nteacher: Oh yes, I understand completely. I would say, if you were to take Cambridge Proficiency, you'd want to prepare properly. Not because you wouldn't pass otherwise (I think you would), but because you probably want more than a pass\nstudent: Exactly :)\nteacher: Ok, the first task ('Adventure Travel') is a multiple choice (the options are on the following page)\nteacher: There's an example just above the text, can you see it?\nstudent: Yes\nstudent: Okay, now I can see both pages, that will make it easier\nteacher: Lovely! I'm waiting for your answers in this case\nstudent: as we ... in front of television'...I am not sure, my guess is B\nteacher: Yes, slump!\nstudent: Then I would say 'captivated in reality television', that is answer A\nteacher: As in sit down heavily\nstudent: 3 A, corner of the globe...\nteacher: Ok, keep going\nstudent: Yes, I was wondering about 'plunge' which, I think, has also a meaning of 'falling down'\nteacher: Oh no, this is more of a 'jump in' / drop in\nteacher: When cooking donuts, plunge bits of dough into smoking hot oil\nteacher: plunge into the swimming pool\nstudent: I see :) In Italian we sometimes use 'buttarsi sul divano' which would be translated to something like 'to fall down on the sofa' that's why I was in doubt...\nteacher: That was a very American spelling of doughnuts on my part :)\nstudent: Haha\nteacher: Yes, that exactly is 'slump'\nstudent: Number 4 is hard. I would try with A, 'to forsake the beaten path' but I guess this is another case of...\nstudent: I can't remember the name for words that go together!\nteacher: How about you complete this task, and then we'll check? I'm worried about breaking your focus\nteacher: collocations :)\nstudent: 5. B, 6. B (?), 7 A., 8 A.\nstudent: The ? is because I am really not sure...\nstudent: Indeed, collocations was the word thank you :)\nteacher: Yes, that's what I thought. It's correct, actually, number 6\nstudent: I was unsure about using 'wide planet'...it doesn't sound wrong to me...\nteacher: Ok, that's interesting actually. wide / diverse / mixed / different planet. Which ones did you eliminate straightaway?\nstudent: I immediately removed mixed and different\nteacher: Ok, cool\nteacher: I would say, 'vast' would work here, to emphasize the size. But not wide\nteacher: And the focus here is definitely on how diverse it is, in terms of landscape, climate etc. etc.\nstudent: I see...would wide be more suitable for a two-dimensional object?\nstudent: Yes, that is why I finally went for 'diverse', it fits the message of this small paragraph better\nteacher: Hmm, you can say 'it's a wide room' for example. I don't think 'wide' has this metaphoric meaning in English, and yes, I wouldn't use it to describe a sphere\nteacher: Yes, exactly\nstudent: *it fits\nteacher: Ok, can we go back to 2, please? All of these words fit meaning-wise but only one of them goes with the preposition 'in'\nstudent: hmmm...maybe 'grip in'?\nteacher: Noo, engrossed in\nteacher: The rest of them collocate with 'by'!\nstudent: Oh, okay...does 'captivate' collocate also with 'from'?\nteacher: could you give me an example of what you mean?\nstudent: I was thinking of 'I was captivated by her look', but after writing it I believe this is not right...\nteacher: Yes, you need by!\nteacher: As the agent in the passive\nteacher: Her beauty captivated film audiences everywhere.\nteacher: Film audiences everywhere were captivated by her beauty\nteacher: Same as: My neighbour built this house. This house was built by my neighbour\nstudent: I see :) well, mixing up 'from' and 'by' is a typical mistake for an Italian speaker, as they both translate to the same word, 'da'...at least most of the times\nteacher: Ah, I see! That makes sense!\nteacher: I'll keep that in mind\nteacher: Ok, number 4, please!\nteacher: The expression is 'off the beaten track'\nteacher: as in, far from popular places / crowds\nstudent: I was unsure between A and C...\nteacher: Some people are happy to holiday in well-established locations while others prefer to find something off the beaten track\nstudent: You never know what you find, when you go off the beaten track...\nteacher: Exactly! :)\nteacher: Ok, and finally 8\nteacher: it all counts! C\nteacher: Whether you're reading or watching something in English, it all counts (towards your language practice)\nteacher: Unfortunately, pizza sauce doesn't count towards / as one of our five-a-day\nstudent: it fits' is used only referring to clothing?\nteacher: Oh no, not necessarily!\nteacher: Let me think\nstudent: (I also don't know what five-a-day is)\nteacher: a theory can fit\nteacher: Oh, you know how we're advised to eat 5 portions of fruit / vegetables a day?\nstudent: Yes, now it makes sense!\nstudent: Haha, that's a nice one\nteacher: Known in the UK as your 5 a day\nteacher: Actually, I shouldn't have hyphenated it probably, hmm, I'm in doubt now\nteacher: If you\nteacher: Sorry\nteacher: If you think of an explanation for something, but you don't know for sure, you can say, it fits (it looks plausible)\nteacher: or it doesn't fit\nstudent: I see :) Okay, thank you!\nteacher: Ok, I've got to let you go now! same time next week?\nstudent: Okay!\nstudent: Thank you, have a nice day! See you next Tuesday :)\nteacher: Great! Obviously, we'll be in touch in case of any changes\nteacher: Thank you, you too! Yes, speak to you in a week!",
    "teacher: Hi, can you read my message on Skype, please?\nteacher: Hi Samantha Smith, one second\nteacher: Maybe just tell me here?\nstudent: send me the link please\nteacher: Oh, one second\nstudent: that's why I\nstudent: need Skype\nteacher: Ah, my Skype won't start! hold on\nstudent: mine neither\nstudent: strange\nteacher: Are you trying to switch to your iPad?\nteacher: Done! Have you got it?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: great\nstudent: but I typed it by myself)\nteacher: sure\nstudent: okay\nteacher: We made it eventually!\nteacher: How's life with an iPad? :)\nstudent: nice\nteacher: You are on your iPad now, aren't you?\nstudent: no\nstudent: I am on my computer now)\nteacher: Oh I see. Have you tried your iPad for school books yet?\nstudent: of course\nteacher: Is it convenient?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Lovely\nteacher: We've had two snowy days now!\nstudent: nice\nstudent: There is also a lot of snow here\nteacher: Which is really weird for us, we are in a part of the country where the climate is really mild\nteacher: Oh really?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Ok, just for a bit of practice, can you tell me three things about your week? One boring, one fun and one new\nteacher: And I'll tell you about mine!\nstudent: This Saturday my friend invited me to his birthday\nstudent: that's new\nteacher: Cool! What are you going to give him?\nstudent: It was fun that half of the class didn't come last Friday because there is a little virus in our class I think and because of the weather\nstudent: little\nteacher: a little virus :)) nice and cute\nstudent: and it's boring that tomorrow is geography\nteacher: Ooh, geography, yes, I remember it's not your favourite subject!\nteacher: Ok, my boring is definitely not being able to go anywhere because of the lockdown\nteacher: The fun one is the book I'm reading, His Dark Materials, the fantasy one I told you about\nteacher: And the new one is that we're buying a car! We're very excited but can't go anywhere for now\nstudent: nice\nteacher: I'm really looking forward to exploring East Anglia where we live. All the places we weren't able to visit without a car!\nteacher: Anyway, I'd like to talk about bookshops with you today! Do you ever go to bookshops? How do you prefer to buy books, in shops or online? If you do go to bookshops, what is your favourite bookshop like?\nstudent: I go to a library)\nstudent: now I am reading \\A Student and a Black Hand\\\"\"\nteacher: Ooh, a library is a very good option!\nteacher: I haven't heard about this book. Tell me, please!\nstudent: I've just started it, but it is about\nstudent: Yura, he is in 8 grade, and at their school a lot of people get a message on a piece of paper to come to a place that Black Hand would name and leave there some money OR everybody will know your secrets, but accidentaly, Yura finds there a dead body\nteacher: Ooh, sounds like a thriller!\nteacher: and a detective story, right?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Lovely\nteacher: Well, speaking about bookshop, this is the situation in the UK\nteacher: Lots of people buy books online, from huge companies like Amazon. Books can be quite cheap on Amazon, and people can order from the comfort of their own homes\nteacher: Still, some people love going to actual bookshops. Some of them are really nice, with cafes for example\nteacher: Some bookshops also invite authors to give talks, or bands to play, or comedians\nteacher: There are big chains of shops. If one company owns several shops around the country, this is called a chain\nteacher: Can you think of a chain shop in Ukraine? Not necessarily a bookshop. A shop that you can find in Kyiv, in Lviv, in Vinnitsa etc., and they are pretty  much the same\nstudent: Lviv's croissants)\nteacher: Ok, great! A cafe chain, right?\nteacher: Good spelling of 'croissants', well done :)\nstudent: yeah\nteacher: Yes, chains can be quite big companies too\nteacher: Also, there are independent bookshops\nteacher: For example, one person wants to open their own bookshop business. They don't want to be part of a chain. Just their own bookshop\nteacher: These independent (or 'indie') bookshops can be very interesting and even unusual\nteacher: or, as people say in the UK, quirky\nteacher: quirky = unusual in a nice way\nteacher: For example, she was wearing quirky sunglasses\nteacher: Often, chain shops are pretty standard, not quirky\nteacher: Another word for 'unusual', but in an old-fashioned way, is 'quaint'\nteacher: The bookshop we're going to watch a video about is both quirky and quaint :)\nteacher: for example, a quaint old cottage\nteacher: Are you with me, Samantha Smith?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Cool! I'm going to send you a link to the video about an independent bookshop like this. Can you please watch it and say what problem the bookshop was facing?\nstudent: send it here\nstudent: pls\nstudent: hello\nstudent: ?\nteacher: will you be able to copy it?\nstudent: yes, but are you sure it is the correct link?\nstudent: ?\nteacher: Yes, I am!\nteacher: The video is called 'Bookshop in a fairy-tale tweet'\nstudent: it doesn't work(\nteacher: Oh no! Maybe you can use the link from Skype and watch it as your homework\nteacher: What problem do you think the bookshop might be facing?\nstudent: oh\nstudent: worked\nteacher: Haha, ok, have a watch then\nstudent: one day nobody came to the shop\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: Are you typing?\nstudent: no\nstudent: should I?\nstudent: that was the problem\nstudent: they earned nothing\nteacher: No worries, I thought you were! Yes, you're right. This is the problem with this chatroom, we don't know if the other person is saying something else\nteacher: Yes, true! Ok, Samantha Smith, we'll continue next week (same time, right?)\nteacher: Enjoy your friend's birthday and the rest of your week!\nstudent: okie, bye bye!\nteacher: Bye!",
    "student: Hi, Ms. Rodriguez.!\nstudent: I'm sorry for being late\nteacher: Morning!\nteacher: No worries\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: Actually is it the right expression in that case?\nstudent: I'm fine\nstudent: How are you?\nteacher: Good, thank you! It's still snowing!\nstudent: how are you Valentine's Day preparations? )\nteacher: I mean, it's snowing again this morning\nstudent: Valentine's\nteacher: Well, I've ordered everything for a chocolate cake that Ethan is going to decorate with some hearts\nstudent: Wow. It was snowing all last night in Kyiv\nstudent: It was\nstudent: I think today we will have even more snow than yesterday\nteacher: Oh wow! Did you have to dig out your car?\nstudent: Do you have any special decorations for the cake? How are you going to do the hearts? )\nteacher: Oh, we've got some chocolate hearts for cakes\nstudent: Dig out? Otcopat? )\nteacher: That's right!\nteacher: Oh no, because you've got __-___ parking!\nstudent: off-street )\nteacher: That's right))\nstudent: ok\nstudent: so..\nteacher: underground, right?\nstudent: Dig out\nteacher: Yes, the verb is dig (dug-dug)\nstudent: so like to clean from snow?\nteacher: No, you can dig soil, not just snow\nteacher: dig with a spade, for example. Like Ethan's green spade in the picture you sent me yesterday\nteacher: When people garden, they often dig\nteacher: Also, we can dig to find treasure\nstudent: It was difficult for Adam yesterday evening to vyekhat from the on-street parking near his office\nteacher: to leave? drive off\nstudent: To leave the on-street parking\nstudent: He even had to ask his colleagues to help him\nstudent: To push the car I mean\nstudent: *push\nteacher: Oh wow, it's really snowing at the moment! This is so weird and beautiful!\nteacher: I can imagine!\nstudent: he has a spade\nteacher: Very useful!\nstudent: But it didn't help him\nstudent: so it's hard to move in Kyiv now\nteacher: Also, a special wide spade for moving snow is called a shovel\nteacher: It can also be a verb, people shovel snow (to clean their driveway, for example)\nstudent: ok! I see\nstudent: I've googled a spade and a shovel and it's the same images )))\nteacher: Haha, well, I think a shovel is a type of spade\nteacher: During\nteacher: sorry\nteacher: During World War 2, there was a campaign in Britain called Dig for Victory\nteacher: Have you heard about it? People were encouraged to grow food in their gardens, to save the country from starvation\nstudent: oh\nteacher: You know Green Park in London? Not far from Buckingham Palace. If I remember correctly, it became a vegetable garden during the war\nstudent: I think I should have heard about it but I don't know a lot unfortunately\nstudent: Really? Green Park! I know it. It's quite huge!\nteacher: Yes! I think I remember correctly, I'll check it later on\nteacher: But also, most people had a garden, and they were asked to grow potatoes and carrots and turnips instead of flowers\nstudent: I see\nstudent: turnips?\nteacher: You can still get 'Dig for Victory' mugs\nteacher: Yes, it's a root vegetable.\nteacher: I think the best thing would be to google a picture of it!\nteacher: It's not the most exciting vegetable, but it was an important part of meals back in the day (not so much now)\nstudent: I've seen\nstudent: It's repa maybe?\nteacher: It's either repa or red'ka or something like that\nteacher: Yes, probably!\nstudent: Actually\nteacher: Actually, the tale we all know, about an old man who grew a vegetable so big he needed help pulling it out, is called An Enormous Turnip in this country\nstudent: I like it when it's salad turnips\nstudent: You have to try it )\nstudent: It's red inside )\nteacher: Salad turnips? Maybe I do!\nstudent: But outside it could be green or white\nteacher: Interesting!\nstudent: salatnaya redka in Russian\nstudent: Just google it\nteacher: So yes, that's the verb dig (dug-dug) for you!\nstudent: Ok! )\nteacher: I will!\nstudent: it has a very good taste\nstudent: it's not like a usual turnip\nteacher: turNIP\nteacher: I think usual turnips are quite bland\nstudent: turnip!\nteacher: Ok, I've got some words for you from the previous class. Could you tell me, please, which parts of speech they are (noun, verb, adjective etc.). Some of them can be more than one part of speech!\nstudent: ok!\nteacher: Rebel, rebellion, quirky, forlorn, rollout, alignment, browse,  tweet\nstudent: rebel could be a noun or a verb\nstudent: and they have different stresses\nstudent: rEbel is a noun\nstudent: rebEl is a verb\nteacher: Very good :)\nstudent: rebellion is a noun, it's a process )\nteacher: Yes, that's right!\nstudent: quirky is like quaint but different )))))\nstudent: it's an adjective\nteacher: Haha, yes\nstudent: ok\nteacher: quaint is unusual and maybe old-fashioned\nstudent: forlorn is an adjective too\nstudent: lonely\nstudent: alone\nstudent: rollout\nteacher: yes, sad and lonely\nstudent: hm\nstudent: let me think\nstudent: or google ))\nstudent: I remember we were talking about it\nstudent: we were\nstudent: but the meaning\nteacher: Oh, it's the introduction of a new product or service\nteacher: the rollout of vaccines\nteacher: was the example\nstudent: ah!\nstudent: I saw!\nstudent: ok\nteacher: And you said the word had been borrowed in Russian\nstudent: so it's a noun\nteacher: yes)\nteacher: alignment, browse, tweet\nteacher: so that you don't have to scroll up and down\nstudent: let's start from the end )\nteacher: ok!\nstudent: tweet is a noun or a verb\nstudent: But Twitter\nstudent: Browse is a verb\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: yes\nstudent: you can browse at the shop or through a book\nteacher: perfect))\nstudent: aaand\nstudent: alignment\nteacher: Even if you don't remember the meaning, you can tell which part of speech alignment is, can't you?\nstudent: I need your help or the help of google )\nstudent: alignment is a noun\nstudent: or the help of Cambridge Dictionary ))\nteacher: Yes, sure! It's a position of two or more things when they are in a straight line or parallel to each other\nstudent: at first! ))\nstudent: Ah! Yes!\nteacher: Or, it can mean 'an agreement'\nteacher: Their political views are in alignment\nteacher: or something like that\nstudent: I see\nteacher: Ok, cool! I'm going to give you some sentences with gaps, could you put the words in the gaps, please?\nteacher: Rebel (v.), rebellion, quirky, forlorn, rollout, alignment, browse,  tweet\nteacher: 1. If you\u2019re a social media influencer, you have to ______ every day. 2. The company started a big advertising campaign, to help with the rollout of its new product. 3.

Don't look\nteacher: I forgot to remove some words\nstudent: ok!\nstudent: I've closed my eyes )\nteacher: Silly me! one second\nteacher: Ok, you might have to change the form of the words, like add -ing or -ed\nteacher: 1. If you\u2019re a social media influencer, you have to ______ every day. 2. The company started a big advertising campaign, to help with the ____ of its new product. 3.

If you\u2019re a social media influencer, you have to browse every day.\nteacher: Hmm, that's also true!\nstudent: The company started a big advertising campaign, to help with the rollout of its new product.\nteacher: My idea was you have to .... post on Twitter every day...\nteacher: yes to 2!\nstudent: so first is different?\nstudent: tweet\nstudent: ok!\nteacher: That's right!\nstudent: 3. I was browsing through some magazines while waiting for my appointment.\nteacher: yes!\nstudent: so browse is here )\nteacher: yep\nstudent: 4. Their houses are completely different.

I think 'quirky' is really positive\nteacher: what we call in Russian 'original'\nstudent: 5. During her teenage rebellion, she dyed her hair a new colour every three months.\nteacher: yes!\nstudent: I know a woman who does it as an adult ))\nteacher: Quirky!\nstudent: 6. She looked a ____ figure standing at a bus stop.\nstudent: ok\nstudent: ah!\nstudent: forlorn\nteacher: yes!\nstudent: 7. We would be able to control the virus better if people didn\u2019t rebel against lockdown rules.\nteacher: yes!\nstudent: and!\nstudent: 8. You hear that noise because the wheels are out of alignment.\nteacher: Yaay!\nteacher: that's right))\nteacher: Were you a rebellious teenager?\nstudent: no )\nteacher: Neither was I\nstudent: I mean yes but if compared with others - no )\nstudent: Oh! My favorite neither )\nteacher: I think I should have rebelled more, it would have been good for me\nteacher: That's right)\nstudent: Ms. Rodriguez. : I think I should have rebelled more, it would have been good for me\nstudent: maybe yes and maybe no\nteacher: Well, yes, you're right\nstudent: We don't know how we could have changed our life if we had done something in a different way )\nstudent: changed\nteacher: Yes! let's make a nice third conditional out of it))\nstudent: or\nstudent: oh!\nstudent: ok\nstudent: I don't remember )\nteacher: would have V 3, if had V3\nteacher: Our lives ___ ____ been different if we ___ ____ something in a different way\nstudent: We don't know how we would have changed our life or ourselves, if we had done something in a different way\nteacher: Yes, good! but missing a subject in the first part\nteacher: We don't know how ___ would have changed\nstudent: Our lives would have been different if we had done something in a different way\nteacher: yes!\nstudent: ok )\nteacher: Ok, lovely\nstudent: thank you )\nteacher: A very quick thing before we finish. I found some nice 'dig for Victory' photos. Can you please have a look at picture 3? Do you recognize the place?\nstudent: ok\nstudent: let me see\nstudent: Kensington Gardens!\nteacher: Yes!\nstudent: actually I didn't recognize\nstudent: )\nteacher: It says underneath))\nstudent: yes )\nstudent: it's so interesting\nteacher: As you can see, it's not just vegetables, but chickens and geese etc.\nstudent: aha!\nteacher: If you are curious, google some Dig for Victory posters, they are really interesting.\nteacher: Ok, I've got to let you go!

    "teacher: Hi Emily!\nstudent: Hello!\nstudent: How are you?\nteacher: Hi! Good thank you!\nteacher: And you?\nstudent: Fine too\nteacher: How are you dealing with the weather? I heard that even schools closed today\nstudent: I had a little too much wine yesterday and now my overall condition isn't 100 per cent)))\nteacher: Haha, I'll go easy on grammar))\nstudent: I like the weather. It's hard to reach places but it's also fun\nstudent: Yes. Schools are closed as well as kindergardens\nteacher: Has Sophie's nanny made it to yours though/\nteacher: ?\nstudent: I tried to write the composition and stopped halfway... I guess they call it a writer's block haha\nstudent: Oh yes. Emily's nanny is a warrior woman\nteacher: That's it! We can try together later on\nteacher: Wonderful!\nteacher: How\nteacher: sorry\nstudent: They spend hours outside still\nstudent: Even with this weather.\nteacher: How's Liam's bilingual journey coming along? Sarah just told me that he could speak 'in a normal human language and also a bit of Russian' (multiple facepalm emojis)\nstudent: AHahahaha LOL\nteacher: Oh wow! A warrior woman indeed!!\nstudent: Well, I don't think it's coming along smoothly. I can see that she prefers  Russian\nstudent: We have \u041c\u0430\u043b\u044b\u0448\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0438 in 2 languages\nstudent: In English it's Babyriki\nstudent: And whenever I switch it to Russian she is more engaged in it\nteacher: Yes, I've definitely had to adjust my expectations. It's not nearly as simple as I thought with bilingualism\nstudent: As if she understands more\nteacher: I see, yes, makes sense. Babyriki sounds Japanese to me))\nstudent: On a brighter note, she already uses some of her English in real life.\nstudent: She says 'Cold!' when they play with the snow\nteacher: Great!\nstudent: Or when we go to the balcony\nstudent: And she also says 'Done' when she is finished with something. Or (and this is funny) when an episode ends on TV\nstudent: when she finishes*\nteacher: Yep, done with this one :))\nstudent: Exactly)))\nstudent: What does Sarah say in Russian?\nteacher: ruki vverh, pushistyi and podmyshka\nteacher: lol\nstudent: What a selection!\nteacher: He only talks a bit of Russian when on Skype to my parents. He used to say more when he was Liam's age!\nteacher: Ah well, it is what it is! He chats non-stop in the 'normal human language'\nstudent: He's into hushing sounds in Russian\nstudent: Judging from his selection of phrases\nstudent: Normal human language haha\nstudent: It might one day be that for sure\nteacher: So I do realize that getting his Russian to a usable level would take a lot of work, all in the context of very little motivation from him. Sigh. Maybe one day as you say\nstudent: Do you follow One-parent-One-language approach with him?\nteacher: Nope, which was probably my downfall\nteacher: Mr. Michael Thompson doesn't understand much Russian, so it always felt a bit exclusive to speak it\nstudent: Maybe that's why. No need in Russian\nteacher: Anyway, before we go on to some CPE stuff, can we please try to shift next week's class? I know I only messaged you yesterday with the time, sorry, but I didn't take into account an appointment I have\nstudent: Sure\nstudent: No worries\nteacher: Would 11.30 am on Wednesday work for you at all?\nstudent: I think it's possible\nteacher: Yes? Thank you very much and apologies again!\nstudent: Ok. Let me write it down\nteacher: Thanks\nstudent: Ok. Done\nstudent: Thank you\nteacher: Lovely, thanks!\nstudent: Let's do some tests maybe?\nteacher: Would you like to post your essay here? We'll have a look and see how it could be finished\nstudent: I have the book\nstudent: Oh no\nstudent: I hate it\nstudent: You know I started hand writing it and continued in my note book\nstudent: I can take pictures and send it to you. However, I think it's really hard to read\nteacher: Oh, I thought that might be the case. Ok then! I'm just worried it'll start to haunt you in your sleep))\nstudent: At least you'll know it exists haha\nstudent: You know the problem I have with the composition is that I know what to write at this point\nteacher: No, I trust you. You  can type it for the next time and we'll finish it 'in real time' if you want, that might be easier than leaving you face-to-face with it\nstudent: But when I write I don't like the language I use at all and I know that for CPE it's too basic and I'm discouraged\nteacher: Ah, ok, I am with you! Yes, it's a skill!\nstudent: Ok. Will do my best)\nstudent: Indeed\nstudent: It's like a muscle that was never trained\nteacher: I remember when I was preparing for CPE, I knew that, in writing and speaking, I needed to squeeze in, for example, a mixed conditional, an inversion and an emphatic structure, and some tricky clauses with linkers\nteacher: I had this kind of a mental checklist.\nteacher: You know what, let's practise. Remember 'it is deemed' from the last class?\nstudent: Could we possibly work on some examples of these?\nteacher: Mona Lisa is deemed one of the finest works of art\nteacher: #ERROR!\nstudent: You can give me this checklist and for the next time I'll try to find you examples of each\nteacher: Yes, definitely, we are on it!\nstudent: Oh yes! I remember 'deemed'\nteacher: Cool, nice C2 word. Ok, I'm going to give you the writing task and you write the first two sentences using 'it's deemed', ok? Just to practise putting thoughts onto the skeleton of C2 grammar and vocab))\nstudent: Cool\nstudent: Let's try this\nteacher: A travel magazine has asked readers to submit articles on their favourite public building, a town hall or a museum, for example. Write an article about your favourite buiolding explaining why it's your favourite building and assessing its significance for the wider community\nteacher: Ok, could you give me the first couple of sentences, please? I'll give you 5 min\nstudent: Ok\nstudent: National Art Museum of Ukraine is deemed one of the biggest in the country.\nteacher: Snap! I would write about that building too :))\nstudent: Oh really/\nstudent: It has this certain vibe\nteacher: It's probably 'the National Art Museum', right?\nteacher: Yes, probably my favourite building in Kyiv!\nstudent: Right\nstudent: It was built in 1899\nteacher: Ok, next one! Let's go with this structure: Both X and Y, ..... or Neither X nor Y, ....\nteacher: For example: Both delicioius and comforting, my lunch today consisted of a bowl of dumplings\nteacher: or: Neither healthy nor particularly nutritious, my lunch today consisted of a bowl of dumplings\nteacher: I'm not sure what this structure is called. I'll research it while you write))\nstudent: Should it be about the museum?\nteacher: about the museum, yes!\nstudent: OK!\nteacher: sorry! ))\nstudent: Both extravagant and minimalistic, the museum continues to attract visitors with different art preferences from Ukraine and beyond.\nstudent: haha probably doesn't make much sense\nteacher: Wonderful! Makes perfect sense!\nteacher: Lovely!\nteacher: Ok, an emphatic structure. Something like... it was at this museum that... what I love most about it is...\nstudent: What I love most about it is the ambience and the feeling of lightness you get when you walk its halls.\nteacher: Ah, another excellent sentence!\nstudent: #ERROR!\nteacher: Ok, how about an inversion? Not only is it ...., but it is also...\nstudent: Ok\nstudent: Rarely have I seen such intricate sculpture work.\nteacher: Ooh, excellent!\nstudent: I think this is excellent writing practice\nteacher: Ok, lovely! I've copied all your sentences in a separate file. Next time, we can put together a nice introduction and maybe even write the whole thing. You've now written about 70 words, which is about a fourth of what you need\nteacher: So 1/4 of the way there! Just need to arrange and link the sentences\nstudent: Wow\nstudent: That's how writing compositions should be\nstudent: Thank you!\nteacher: A structure is important too, we'll start with a plan next time\nteacher: how much you love it and how important it is for the community))\nstudent: Sure\nteacher: Ok, lovely! I'll let you go, speak to you on Wednesday then!\nstudent: I love it very much. It is very important for the community --  won't suffice? )))\nteacher: Nooooo :))))\nteacher: Your ode to Khanenko's))\nstudent: )))\nstudent: Ok then! Thank you for the lesson\nstudent: See you on Wednesday!\nteacher: My pleasure, take care!\nstudent: You too\nstudent: Bye!",
    "student: Hello, Emily Thompson.\nstudent: Sorry, I'm a little late.\nteacher: Hi Emily!\nteacher: No worries, I appreciate you making time for this project during the festive period\nteacher: Has the holiday begun yet?\nstudent: Yes!\nteacher: Oh, Happy New Year then!\nstudent: Tomorrow is the Chinese New Year.\nstudent: Thanks!\nteacher: At my son's school the topic this week has been Chinese New Year.\nteacher: Well, we're homeschooling because of the lockdown so it's not exactly at school, but school tells us every day what we should be working on with him\nstudent: Wow! Chinese New Year is also popular in The UK.\nteacher: Yes, of course! It's such a beautiful holiday, and there are many Chinese people living or studying here\nteacher: or living and studying :)\nstudent: Yes. The UK has the best colleges in the world.\nstudent: colleges\nteacher: They are pretty good, yes!\nteacher: Are you off work then? Are you enjoying having some time off?\nstudent: Yes. I'm on holiday.\nstudent: Because this holiday is so important in China.\nteacher: Yes, of course! Have you got any plans for your holiday? Or are you just taking it easy?\nstudent: I don\u2019t have any plans, but learning English is the most important work I need to do on my vacation.\nstudent: I have to take an English test as part of an application for the PhD project.\nteacher: Oh I see! Can I help in any way? What's the test like?\nstudent: A little like the Chinese liu ji.\nteacher: I'm not familiar with that, sorry. Will you have to write an essay? or speak? or do a grammar test?\nstudent: Yes. There is a grammar test consisting of multiple choice questions, an essay, reading and translation.\nteacher: Ooh, I see, sounds difficult! What would you like to do today? Any bit of grammar that I can help you with? or writing?\nstudent: Can you teach me something about grammar?\nteacher: Yes, sure! What kind of grammar do you need most for the test? Maybe tenses?\nstudent: Sounds great.\nteacher: Ok, great! Let's quickly revise what we've done before.\nstudent: OK!\nteacher: We talked about Present Simple vs. Present Continuous\nstudent: Yes.\nteacher: I work for the University of Cambridge (present simple). I'm talking to my student Emily at the moment (present continuous)\nteacher: Present Simple = things that are generally true and things that we do regularly\nteacher: Present Continuous = things that are happening at the moment\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: Hold on, I'll find an exercise\nteacher: Ok, could you fill in the gaps with a negative form of present continuous, please?\nteacher: You don't understand because you     listening to me!\nteacher: sorry\nteacher: You don't understand because you _______ listening to me!\nstudent: sorry, what words do I need to fill in.\nteacher: Oh, sorry. The negative form of present continuous. 'you aren't listening to me!'\nteacher: Does it make sense?\nstudent: Yes.\nteacher: Richard and Cecile had a big argument and now they  ____   talking to each other.\nstudent: are\nteacher: and the negative form?\nstudent: are not\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: Ok, could you turn these sentences into negatives? Present simple this time\nteacher: He works as a doctor\nteacher: No, he....\nstudent: He doesn't work as a doctor.\nteacher: Yes, good!\nteacher: We like ice cream\nstudent: We don't like ice cream.\nteacher: Yes, sure! And now can you choose, present simple or present continuous?\nstudent: Yes.\nteacher: I ___ (work) at the moment.\nstudent: am working\nteacher: Yes!\nteacher: (he/come) to London often?\nstudent: He comes to London often.\nteacher: Ok, could you make a question, please?\nstudent: Does he come to London often?\nteacher: Yes, great\nteacher: They  (not/come) to the party tomorrow.\nstudent: will not come\nteacher: Aha, I see. Remember we talked about Present Continuous for future plans?\nteacher: Present Continuous or 'be going to'\nstudent: Yes.\nteacher: They aren't coming to the party tomorrow (it's their plan)\nstudent: So come is the same as go?\nteacher: For example, tomorrow I'm making dinner for my family and talking to my parents on Skype. What are your plans\nteacher: ?\nteacher: Come and go are not exactly the same but very similar in this case\nstudent: I'm going to make dinner for my family and talk to my parents on Skype tomorrow.\nstudent: tomorrow\nteacher: Yes, you're right. We can use 'I'm making' (present continuous) or 'I'm going to make'\nteacher: for plans\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: For the future, we use Present Continuous and 'be going to' for plans and 'will' for something we've just decided to do\nteacher: For example, the sun is shining outside. I think, when I finish work, I'll go outside.\nteacher: I've just decided to do it, so I use 'will'\nstudent: OK. I know this part.\nteacher: Yes, great\nteacher: As you can see, I'm not using a future form after 'when'\nteacher: When I finish work, I'll do this and that...\nteacher: when I finish work (Present Simple)\nteacher: I'll ask my husband when he comes home. (He will come home in the future, but I still use Present Simple after 'when')\nteacher: And the same with 'if'\nteacher: If he asks, I'll tell him\nteacher: If he works hard, he'll earn a bonus\nteacher: things like that. Do you remember this rule?\nstudent: OK.\nstudent: Yes.\nteacher: Ok, great!\nteacher: And another present tense is Present Perfect\nteacher: When do we use Present Perfect?\nstudent: When we say something has already been done?\nteacher: Yes, when we talk about something that has been done / something that has happened\nteacher: but we don't say exactly when, so it's not a past tense\nteacher: for example, I haven't finished work yet / I have already finished work\nteacher: And also, when a situation started some time ago and still continues\nteacher: For example, I have loved reading since I was a little girl.\nteacher: I started loving reading when I was a little girl and I still love it now!\nstudent: OK.\nteacher: I haven't seen him for three weeks.\nteacher: things like that\nteacher: Ok, I'm going to send you some sentences with gaps and you make present perfect, ok?\nstudent: OK\nteacher: Sophie and I (know)     each other since we were at school together.\nstudent: have known\nteacher: yes, lovely\nteacher: I (play)     tennis since I was eight years old.\nstudent: have played ?\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: Alain (be)     in hospital three times this year.\nstudent: has been\nteacher: yes, good\nteacher: I (want)     to be an actor for as long as I can remember.\nstudent: have wanted\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: Since he finished university, my brother (work)     in five different countries.\nstudent: has worked\nteacher: Yes, good!\nteacher: In the test, watch out for indications of time in a sentence. If it's a period that is not finished yet (today, this year, since I was young, for the past 8 years), it is probably present perfect! (or present perfect continuous)\nteacher: What indications of time can you expect with present simple?\nstudent: present simple maybe has no indications of time?\nteacher: Yes, there are some! For example, every day / week / year / month, usually, always, regularly, often, sometimes\nteacher: I always brush my teeth before I go to bed. - things like that\nteacher: What can you expect with present continuous?\nstudent: Now\nteacher: Yes, absolutely. Now, at the moment etc.\nstudent: or still doing something that's not finished\nteacher: When is your PhD exam? Soon?\nteacher: Yes, that's right!\nstudent: next month\nteacher: Ok! I'll prepare some more grammar material for you for the next time then and we can have a class at the same time next Thursday, ok?\nstudent: OK.\nstudent: Thanks a lot.\nteacher: My pleasure!\nteacher: Ok, enjoy your holiday! Very happy New Year to you!\nstudent: Thanks.\nteacher: Bye :(\nteacher: sorry, I meant :)\nstudent: Bye bye",

The time when people are restricted in what they should eat. And after the Lent, it's Easter\nteacher: I don't know when Maslyanitsa is in Ukraine this year! It's a slightly different calendar, isn't it?\nteacher: So tonights I'm making some cr\u00eapes, I'm looking forward to it\nteacher: *tonight\nstudent: nice\nteacher: Do you know a 'cr\u00eape'?\nstudent: no\nteacher: It's a big thin pancake which you can fill with something yummy\nteacher: Usually pancakes are small and thick, but cr\u00eapes are big and thin\nstudent: I want pancakes now(\nteacher: Sorry, that's my fault!\nstudent: hehe\nstudent: never mind\nteacher: Can you guess which language the word 'cr\u00eape' comes from?\nstudent: Is crepe like blinchik?\nstudent: French?\nteacher: Yes, that's right!\nteacher: Yes, like blinchik)\nteacher: Ok, let's go back to the video from the last time! Do you remember what it was about?\nteacher: Hint: a bookshop\nstudent: yes\nteacher: What happened?\nstudent: nobody came there one day\nteacher: Yes, that's right\nstudent: they posted on Twitter\nstudent: Twitter\nteacher: yes\nstudent: and it became popular and the next day a lot of people came there again\nteacher: Yes, because it was shared by the writer Neil Gaiman\nteacher: Ok, can you remember the two words from the video that both mean 'weird'? They both start with 'qu'\nstudent: quaint\nteacher: Good!\nstudent: quirky\nteacher: Well done!\nteacher: Quaint means 'strange and old-fashioned' and quirky means 'strange and nice'\nteacher: Could you go back to the video (link in Skype), watch it and tell me whether you spotted anything quirky about the bookshop?\nstudent: it is second-hand\nteacher: Ok, sure\nteacher: Is it unusual?\nstudent: yes\nstudent: I've never seen a second-hand bookshop\nteacher: I suppose they are quite rare in Kyiv, yes! And they are becoming quite rare in the UK too because so much business is happening online\nteacher: Anything else?\nstudent: no\nteacher: Ok! Do you remember our business words? If a company covers the consts and makes some extra money, they make a ____\nstudent: profit\nteacher: Yes! And if the company doesn't cover the costs, they make a ____\nstudent: uh\nteacher: make a loss, right?\nteacher: And if they only cover the costs but don't make a profit, they break ____\nstudent: through\nteacher: even!\nteacher: to break even = to cover the costs but not earn any extra money\nteacher: How's your business, by the way\nteacher: ?\nstudent: okay\nteacher: still running?\nstudent: yeah\nteacher: Good! Are you selling your bead jewellery at school?\nstudent: yes\nstudent: also I have a new classmate\nteacher: Exciting! What are they like\nteacher: ?\nstudent: her name is Sophia Chen and she also sells earrings\nteacher: Ooh, you've got competition!\nstudent: I bought one pair\nteacher: Are they nice?\nteacher: the earrings\nstudent: yeah\nteacher: Cool!

And you weren't making any profit?\nstudent: I think I would make it a bit more creative and also I could create an online shop\nteacher: Ok, interesting! In what way would you make it more creative?\nstudent: the atmosphere would be very cosy, maybe I could hold different events\nstudent: maybe some not loud and nice music\nteacher: Ah, yes, good idea!\nteacher: How do you promote your business? Through Instagram?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Oh, what was the word in the video, for a post on Twitter?\nteacher: a tw..t\nstudent: tweet\nteacher: Yes!

It's about day 10 now\nteacher: They are not feeling too bad?\nstudent: Sophia is completely ok, she didn't even have a high temperature\nstudent: Alex has a temperature like 37.2-37.2\nstudent: not A, just temperature?\nstudent: the temperature?\nteacher: Hmm, I'm having a think\nstudent: And he has a bit of a cough but he is ok\nteacher: He has a temperature of about 37.2\nteacher: Ok, glad to hear it's a mild illness for them!\nstudent: Ah! And neither of them has their sense of smell and taste\nstudent: the? )\nteacher: Yes, they don't have their sense of smell and taste\nstudent: Emma is ok but she is at home self-isolating\nstudent: at? )\nteacher: she is self-isolating at home\nteacher: as a verb\nstudent: ah\nteacher: or 'in self-isolation'\nstudent: In Ukrainian and Russian we use it as a noun\nstudent: ok! I see\nteacher: Yes, you can use it as a noun as well in English\nstudent: ok! I see. Thank you!\nstudent: How is your car? )\nstudent: Have you used it yet? )\nteacher: Well, we drove to a beautiful wood on Sunday, but the wood was locked! We can't go anywhere!\nteacher: Which is the whole idea of a lockdown, but it's becoming a bit depressing\nstudent: the wood is locked? How is it possible?\nteacher: Yes, can you imagine? There's a gate and a lock on the gate, and you can't park\nstudent: I think to walk in a wood is quite safe\nstudent: I can't imagine\nteacher: Yes, but all places like this are closed, and people are not supposed to drive for more than 5 miles to go for a walk\nteacher: So we're very limited in where we can go\nstudent: We had a lockdown last spring but we could go to woods\nteacher: Yes, it's different, isn't it?\nstudent: do you have another option within 5 miles from your home?\nteacher: One option, but it's not very interesting, we could always go there by bike.\nteacher: I've prepared a new video for you for today, and some new words.\nteacher: The video is about an experiment that was done at a nursery\nstudent: ok! )\nteacher: Do you know 'a nursery'? a place where children from 6 months old to 5 are looked after by teachers while their parents work\nstudent: kind of a kindergarten?\nteacher: Yes, that's right!\nstudent: kindergarten?\nteacher: It's called a nursery in the UK\nteacher: You know, the same as a child's bedroom\nteacher: When you read the text about the Queen, it said that children were at a nursery in Buckingham palace, meaning their room\nstudent: child's bedroom -  I haven't heard about it\nstudent: ahhh\nstudent: I see )))\nstudent: I thought a child's bedroom was another name for a kindergarten )))))\nteacher: Yes, the experiment was to take away all toys and give children different materials such as magnets and tools to play with\nteacher: Oh no, sorry, I confused you. A nursery!\nteacher: How do you think this experiment went?\nstudent: It's ok, it's just kind of my understanding ))))))\nstudent: I think the children loved the tools and the magnets )\nteacher: Ok! You'll watch later on and find out :) a few more words first!\nteacher: When something (a new product or programme) is tested for a period of time, this is called a trial\nstudent: Am I not right? )\nteacher: tra\u026a\u0259l\nstudent: I see!\nstudent: a trial lesson )\nteacher: You are, generally)\nteacher: Oh yes, of course, you know that!\nteacher: Before a vaccine is approved, it has to go through a trial\nteacher: Sorry, another coronavirus example\nteacher: And what does it mean if a person is on trial? You might remember from your background in law\nstudent: it means\nstudent: that the person is like investigated in court\nteacher: That's right)\nteacher: Ok, next word!\nteacher: the ability to do something quickly and skilfully with your hands\nstudent: I'm ready for it ))\nteacher: dexterity\nteacher: /dek\u02c8ster.\u0259.ti/\nstudent: ok\nteacher: for example, surgical dexterity\nstudent: lovkost?\nstudent: I'm surprised\nteacher: Yes, I think so!\nstudent: I see!\nteacher: He caught the ball with great dexterity.\nteacher: an example from the dictionary\nteacher: Why are you surprised?\nstudent: I don't know\nstudent: )\nteacher: :))\nstudent: I just didn't know the word before\nteacher: People say that knitting and crafts develops dexterity\nteacher: and Lego))\nteacher: the adjective is 'dexterous\nstudent: I love all this stuff )\nstudent: the adjective is 'dexterous  - ok!\nteacher: If a person can use both hands equally well, they are 'ambidexterous'\nstudent: oh! Ok )\nstudent: I see\nteacher: A person needs to be quite dexterous to eat with chopsticks, for example\nstudent: I even don't know what we call it in Ukrainian or Russian ))\nteacher: or play a musical instrument!\nteacher: I think it's borrowed, \u0430\u043c\u0431\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440 or something\nteacher: But I might be wrong!\nstudent: Oh! Yes! I think I know the word in Russian )\nstudent: You are right\nteacher: Ah, that's interesting. Apparently, 'ambi' in Latin means 'both' and 'dexter' means 'right'. So if you are ambidexterous, it's like you have two right hands\nstudent: it's the same in Russian\nstudent: Ah, that's interesting. Apparently, 'ambi' in Latin means 'both' and 'dexter' means 'right'. So if you are ambidexterous, it's like you have two right hands  - haha! Wow! I like information like this )\nteacher: Yes, very cool, isn't it? I enjoy it too!\nteacher: This is discrimination against left-handed people, as usual\nstudent: Cool! I like it!\nstudent: yep ))\nstudent: I'm sorry\nstudent: I need to go (\nteacher: Ok, of course! I'll send you the link for homework\nteacher: Have a lovely day!\nstudent: Thank you very much! Have a great day! XX\nteacher: Thank you, you too :)\nstudent: bye!! )\nteacher: Bye!",
    "student: Hello Mr. Thompson!\nteacher: Hi Elena Smith!\nstudent: sorry for being late\nteacher: That's ok, I'm just trying to decide what we have time for today\nteacher: Another stressful morning?\nstudent: Yes. Starting from 5 am\nstudent: Ella didn't sleep well\nteacher: Oh goodness! That's extreme!\nstudent: I've got a question for you\nteacher: Yes, go ahead\nstudent: Did you breastfeed Emma?\nteacher: Yes, until he was 2,5\nstudent: If so, could you share your experience of weaning him.\nstudent: I hope I'm not prying\nteacher: No, not at all! Well, the most important thing we did when he was about 18 months old was we weaned him at night\nteacher: Because I was exhausted from night feeds, probably like you are!\nstudent: Yes!\nstudent: Sometimes I'm just losing it\nteacher: We were dead against the 'crying it out' method though.\nstudent: Me too\nteacher: Yes, I don't blame you. The hardest thing!\nstudent: How did you do it?\nteacher: What we did was, instead of me, Mark would sleep with him. The first time Emma woke up at night, Mark would cuddle him and offer a drink of water and let him cry. He still cried, but he wasn't on his own!\nteacher: Same for the secon waking if Mark could manage it\nstudent: Were you in a different room?\nteacher: And then we would swap. Very soon, he stopped waking up so much\nteacher: Yes!\nteacher: We had two bedrooms\nstudent: Did he call you?\nteacher: Yes :( It's hard, but you've got to trust that the Dad will comfort them.\nstudent: And where did Emma sleep? In his cot?\nteacher: If you guys decide to do it, it might be worth for Carlos to take some time off, because, if he's not used to being the nighttime parent, he will be tired!\nstudent: I mean he didn't have a chance to climb down and come to your room\nteacher: We had two big beds, in each bedroom. He would be on the big bed with his Dad\nstudent: I think I'll discuss it with Carlos\nteacher: Hmm, he never did!\nstudent: It's just that I'm pretty sure that's what Ella is going to do\nstudent: She sleeps in her cot but one side of it is attached to our bed and there's no barrier\nstudent: She sometimes rolls on our bed\nteacher: It calls for a lot of love and patience from the Dad, but they can do it!\nteacher: Ah, yes, I know what you mean. Is there anywhere you could go? to sleep separately?\nstudent: Yes, in the living room. The door is no good however between the living room and the bedroom\nstudent: Maybe if we fix the door and use it\nstudent: Do you think it might be better to install the fourth wall into the cot?\nstudent: And comfort her there\nteacher: Hmm, I don't know! The purpose for us was not for Emma to stay in the cot (he didn't even have a cot) but not to nurse at night, so he just cuddled up to Mark on the big bed\nstudent: Hmm. I guess we could try it. Although I think she will just walk out of the room crying and looking for me\nstudent: And how long did it take you?\nteacher: Not necessarily! It's worth a try\nstudent: The whole weaning at nighttime process\nteacher: Not long, maybe a few nights or so\nstudent: Thank you for sharing!\nstudent: I'll definitely discuss it with Carlos\nstudent: I also believe that fathers can work miracles\nteacher: That's ok. To be honest, Emma has slept with Mark ever since :) And I have some peace!\nteacher: Yes, time for Carlos to be a hero, as they say in cartoons\nstudent: OMG the perfect scenario\nstudent: )))\nteacher: but I totally understand your desperation. Feel free to text me in Messenger!\nstudent: Thank you! I might!\nteacher: Haha, yes, we get an occasional raised eyebrow when we tell people this is the case, but it's worked for us. And there have never been any 'monsters under the bed' because Daddy's protecting him\nstudent: Raised eyebrow why? Sounds very sound to me\nstudent: Sounds*\nteacher: Well, you know, people like to have ideas about what other families should and shouldn't do)))\nteacher: I'm just thinking what we'll have time for today.\nstudent: Oh yes!\nteacher: You know what, let's practise some speaking questions! Same idea, pack them with some cool language\nteacher: Wait a sec, I'll retrieve my sample speaking paper\nstudent: Once you have a baby everyone wants to give? their two cents\nstudent: *two\nstudent: OK. Or we can always do the tests.. grammar and vocabulary\nteacher: Haha, yes, we say two pennies here, naturally))\nteacher: Ok! I thought you might be too tired for grammar))\nteacher: One sec\nteacher: key word transformation in this case\nteacher: key word: cut\nteacher: You are not a bad lawyer Martin, but I don't think it is a very suitable job for you.\nteacher: I just don't think you _____________ a lawyer.\nteacher: Use 3-8 words, contractions such as you're count as 2 words\nteacher: Oh sorry, I never answered that! The idiom is 'to put in your two pennies (worth)'\nstudent: Oh thanks\nstudent: I knew it was something to do with money haha\nteacher: I'm sure it's two cents in the US!\nstudent: I just don't think you are cut out to be a lawyer\nstudent: or maybe some kind of a phrasal verb with cut\nstudent: cut down?\nteacher: Nearly! cut out to be\nteacher: Poor Martin\nstudent: I see. Noted\nteacher: this sentence cracks me up for some reason\nstudent: Poor fellow\nstudent: It's the name I guess\nteacher: And the situation!\nstudent: Matrin is always  an underdog\nstudent: Indeed\nteacher: Kind of! Martin's cut out to be an underdog))\nstudent: ))))) Lol\nteacher: )))) ok, next one!\nteacher: I don't have the foggiest idea whether he will be coming or not.\nteacher: key word: whatsoever\nteacher: I have _____________ he will be coming or not.\nstudent: I have no idea whatsoever whether he will....\nteacher: Yes!\nstudent: yay!\nteacher: He failed the exam as he didn't work as fast as the rest of the class.\nteacher: His failure was blamed on his inability _____________ rest of the class.\nteacher: key word: pace\nstudent: on his inability to keep up the pace with the...\nteacher: Yes, very good! or 'to work at the same pace as'\nstudent: or just keep pace with?\nstudent: Oh, right\nteacher: Oh yes, that's a possibility too, sure!\nteacher: Everyone is criticising the government for its poor unemployment record\nteacher: The government _____________ over its unemployment record.\nteacher: key word: come\nstudent: hmm\nstudent: The government has come to be criticized ?\nteacher: the expression is 'to come under (a lot of) criticism'!\nstudent: I know this expression. Why didn't I think of it..\nteacher: Because you got up at 5 am!\nstudent: That's why! Right\nstudent: )))))\nteacher: Right, I've got to let you go, my coach is turning into a pumpkin\nstudent: Thank you for the lesson and the conversation!\nstudent: See you next week!\nteacher: You're very welcome, my pleasure! I'll send you some slots for next week\nstudent: Thanks! Bye!\nteacher: Bye!",
    "student: Hi, Ms. Thompson!\nteacher: Morning!\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: Fine, thank you\nteacher: One second, I'll go upstairs\nstudent: Quite a busy day for Friday\nstudent: )\nstudent: How are you?\nteacher: What have you got on today?\nstudent: Our chat, then yoga, then I have to work with some school stuff, then I'll go to a face massage and then a lesson\nteacher: Yes, nice and busy!\nstudent: then I have to finish watching a webinar about some marketing stuff\nteacher: Do you mean the people who work for the school or some work you need to do for the school? the school staff\nteacher: Ah, now I see! it's stuff. some marketing stuff\nteacher: And staff = people who work in the company\nteacher: a staff meeting; staff room\nstudent: because they have limited access till 22/02 and I'm not sure that I'll have enough time on the weekend\nstudent: Ah! Sure! So in both sentences I meant stuff\nteacher: They are pronounced quite differently too, I would recommend listening to the pronunciation in the dictionary. stuff vs. staff\nteacher: Yes, I got you)\nteacher: Sounds interesting, the webinar on marketing!\nstudent: I would recommend listening to the pronunciation in the dictionary. stuff vs. staff  - I'll do it!\nstudent: ok It's about lovemarks )\nteacher: Lovemarks??\nstudent: The brands which love their clients\nteacher: Interesting!\nstudent: Do you maybe know the girl who founded a big chain of places where you can rent a wardrobe here in Ukraine\nteacher: Oh, where you can hire some clothes? I remember vaguely, something starting with O...\nstudent: Then she founded other services too: beauty, photo services, the shops with some nice stuff )\nstudent: Yes! To hire some clothes )\nstudent: The name is Oh my look )\nteacher: Yes! I remember now!\nstudent: so now she has a big international chain of beauty bars\nteacher: Well done her!\nstudent: Actually I knew her when we were teenagers ) But we have not communicated since those times )\nteacher: You haven't communicated ___ those times\nstudent: Now she decided to do an online intensive course about lovemarks and then she will do a big 2,5 month course about the brand\nstudent: You haven't communicated since those times\nteacher: since!)) or 'since that time'\nstudent: Oh! since!\nstudent: Since that time! of course!\nteacher: Wow, she's really branched out\nteacher: I've looked it up, apparently, lovemarks are supposed to replace the idea of brands. I've never heard about this stuff!\nstudent: branched out? )\nstudent: It means that she has lots of branches of her business?\nteacher: branch out = good business word; to start to do something different from what you usually do\nteacher: For example, if you now opened an ALMA bakery for students to go to after classes, that would be branching out\nteacher: Yes, it comes from the idea of branches of a business\nstudent: I see\nstudent: the webinar was about two weeks ago and I didn't watch the third part when I had access\nteacher: Oh, I see, you need to do it while Oliver's with her nanny, makes sense!\nstudent: and now they've extended access so I have to watch it\nteacher: Nice!\nstudent: How can I say \u0443\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0442\u044c \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442\u044c?\nteacher: Ok, have you had a chance to watch the video about a nursery?\nstudent: exactly \u0443\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0442\u044c?\nteacher: Oh sorry, hold on a second\nstudent: Yes! I've watched it\nteacher: I would say 'manage to watch'\nteacher: manage to do something (not necessarily the idea of time)\nteacher: or 'I need to watch it while I still have access'\nstudent: Aha! Thank you!\nteacher: generally, uspet' is 'be on time', e.g. I was on time for a Zoom call with my colleague\nteacher: but it's different here, isn't it?\nstudent: Yes! It's different!\nteacher: Ok, the nursery! Could you tell me in a few words what happened there?\nstudent: So it was a trial )\nstudent: They replaced toys in the nursery with some everyday stuff: magnets, metal objects etc. Just everyday things )\nteacher: stuff! :)\nstudent: stuff\nteacher: :) yes, sure, go on!\nstudent: ok! So the trial showed that it's even better for imagination and children's dexterity to play with this stuff )\nteacher: Yes! Did the children like it?\nstudent: It's better than toys also because stuff like that prevents children from forming gender stereotypes\nteacher: yes, from forming gender stereotypes, like female princesses vs. male superheroes, right?\nstudent: so in the group of 2-year-olds the children were completely happy to play with the new 'toys'\nstudent: without the?\nteacher: the new toys? the new toys is absolutely fine because they are the toys we've been talking about\nstudent: forming gender stereotypes, yes! Can I use just gender?\nteacher: Hmm, no, it doesn't really work. Let me see what the context was\nstudent: Ok! But three-year-old people ) at first were surprised that the adults decided to change their toys )\nteacher: Gender is something that can be reinforced through toys.\nteacher: as in, Behaviour associated with men / women can be reinforced through toys\nteacher: but I don't think it can work with 'prevent from'\nstudent: gender \u2013 behaviour, characteristics and roles societies associate with men or women\nstudent: they have it after the video\nteacher: Yes, true\nstudent: Ah, I see\nteacher: Hmm, I'm having a think now. What do you think about toys and gender?\nstudent: I don't like stuff like Barbie for that reason\nteacher: Ok! Why not?)\nstudent: lots of princesses and other female characters are too 'feminine'\nteacher: Yes, the word here is 'feminine'\nteacher: \u02c8fem.\u026a.n\u026an\nstudent: Their eyes are too big, their breasts are too big - I hate it\nteacher: #ERROR!\nstudent: Ah, ok!\nteacher: Yes, 'female' is about the sex, male vs. female\nteacher: feminine is about looks / behaviour\nteacher: feminine vs. masculine\nstudent: But I'm not sure about the idea that we have to deprive our children of all their usual toys such as dolls or figurines and give them just kitchen stuff or something like that\nteacher: I think today's cartoons are trying hard to change the stereotypes, but there is still a long way to go!\nstudent: deprive of\nteacher: Yes, I'm with you here! Good use of the verb 'deprive', it goes with 'of'\nteacher: Yes, good correction :))\nstudent: ))\nstudent: I love toys actually! )\nteacher: Me too!\nteacher: And I noticed, when Adam plays with his Lego figurines, for example, he will give them so many roles, it almost doesn't matter what they look like\nstudent: But dolls and figures are not my favorites, I like lego and puzzles and books with stickers and activities )\nteacher: Yes, there's more to do with them!\nstudent: Do you have problems with their hair?\nteacher: the Lego people's?\nstudent: Our Elsa loses her hair all the time )))))\nteacher: Oh no, poor Elsa! We swap their hair and hats all the time, it's so funny!\nstudent: yes! Yesterday our Anna and Elsa swapped their hair )\nteacher: I actually think, in terms of gender stereotypes, it would do more for children if they saw grown-ups in different 'non-traditional' roles. For example, if they had a male teacher at the nursery (but I bet they don't)\nstudent: I even 'didn't recognize' them )\\\nstudent: Yes! I bet you know the theory that they learn not from our words but from our behavior\nteacher: Haha, yes, that's our favourite game. Quick grammar quiz! Anna's hair ___ red and Elsa's hair ___ blond\nteacher: Yes! I'm sure toys have less effect than actual grown-up role models\nstudent: So it will work better if the daddy washes \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0443, for example\nstudent: And the mommy hangs a picture\nteacher: Yes, if daddy does the dishes!\nteacher: Exactly))\nstudent: do the dishes - \u043c\u044b\u0442\u044c \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0443 so?\nteacher: That's right!\nteacher: or 'wash up'\nstudent: the daddy and the mommy is right? )\nteacher: For example, he always washes up after dinner\nteacher: Yes, correct!\nteacher: That's why the machine is called a dishwasher\nstudent: Ah! I see\nteacher: a dishwasher (dishes) and a washing machine (clothes)\nstudent: ok! Thank you!\nteacher: Look, the grammar quiz is following you. Anna's hair ___ red and Elsa's hair ___ blond\nstudent: ok\nstudent: )\nstudent: Anna's hair is red and Elsa's hair is blond\nstudent: I'm not sure\nteacher: Yes, that's a very typical Russian thing. Hair is singular in English! like in Ukrainian\nstudent: Hair is an uncountable noun\nteacher: Anna's hair is red etc.\nstudent: Ok! So Anna's hair is red and Elsa's hair is blond\nteacher: I've just washed my hair. --- I've just washed it\nstudent: Actually professional staff usually use \u0432\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0441 in Russian\nstudent: it's singular too\nstudent: But it is more like professional slang\nteacher: Yes, like that! Am I right that it's singular in Ukrainian?\nstudent: You are completely right! \u0412\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0441\u0441\u044f - \u0432\u043e\u043d\u043e\nteacher: Yay, I remembered! So it's like in Ukrainian\nteacher: Oh, did I tell you that schools will probably re-open on the 8th of March?\nstudent: it's a good example! )\nstudent: I'm so happy for you!\nteacher: Boris is going to talk to the people on Monday\nteacher: Haha, thank you!\nteacher: But!\nteacher: Hairdressers will only re-open later. So children will go to school with diy haircuts)))\nteacher: including Adam\nstudent: )))\nteacher: I would say 'mummy haircuts' but that's gender stereotyping :)))\nteacher: I've now got professional scissors and I was quite pleased with how I did his hair last time, but now it's growing out and I can see all the mistakes\nstudent: I know that in Austria hairdressers were closed so my friend Sophia become a 'hairdresser' for her husband for several months )\nteacher: I haven't had a trim since October! It's getting way too long\nstudent: Ok\nstudent: one more thing about gender stereotypes\nstudent: But I'm happy that I don't have to do it for Oliver )\nteacher: Yes, I bet!\nstudent: But you know, I have Jennifer )\nteacher: Ok, lovely. I'll let you go, great work today! Hope you'll have a productive\nstudent: So in any case I'm a happy person )\nteacher: a productive Friday and a relaxing weekend!\nstudent: Thank you! I love our chats! Have a great weekend )\nteacher: Oh, yes, your Jennifer is a pro! How is she, and your brother, by the way?\nstudent: They are ok, thank you!\nteacher: Are they feeling better?\nstudent: she is completely ok, he is not worse and even quite better\nstudent: thank you!\nteacher: Oh good! Good to hear!\nteacher: Ok, take care! Bye! :)",
    "student: Hello!\nteacher: Hi Sophia!\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: Sorry about the last time...I will have to send you some Italian wine to apologize...\nstudent: I am fine thank you\nstudent: How about you?\nteacher: Haha, don't worry, I've always got other work I need to get on with\nteacher: Good, thank you! We've now got 'a roadmap out of the lockdown', a very slow and cautious exit but still light at the end of the tunnel\nstudent: Yes, I have heard about it. It looks like the vaccination plan is going well in the UK! Here we are still waiting for such a roadmap...\nteacher: Yes, I really hope yours is not far behind!\nstudent: but I believe the government wants things to go back to normal as soon as possible...the problem is doing it in a safe way.\nteacher: Yes, definitely. In the very best case scenario, if the preliminary steps like the re-opening of schools go well, we will be fully unlocked on June 21. Still a while ahead!\nteacher: But children are going back to schools on March 8, with their DIY haircuts\nstudent: I hope we won't be too far behind...anyhow it is going to take a while...\nteacher: Yes, indeed! How are you otherwise? Have you maybe had any interesting encounters with English? I know once a person starts doing more in terms of brushing up on their language, interesting language observations tend to crop up\nstudent: And I also hope they will be quick to reduce travelling restrictions inside the EU: it's been months since the last time I was in Italy!\nteacher: Yes, it must be so frustrating! The EU suddenly has internal borders... We thought we could see my in-laws at Easter, but apparently it's not until mid-May that we'll be allowed to visit, despite the fact they've had their jabs\nstudent: I am good..the weather is better so we started going out...what I noticed about my English is that when I speak it I tend to make more mistakes than what you see here, I guess because I have less time to think.\nstudent: And then, reading, I have noticed a lot of little details that I used to overlook, while now I feel compelled to look them up.\nstudent: Which is good, there are a lot of common terms which I don't use because I never had the time to really look at the word and how it is used :)\nteacher: Aha, interesting (and makes sense!) I actually thought it was the other way around, the chat is quite cruel in that it reveals all spelling errors and grammar mistakes that wouldn't be as noticeable if a person was talking, but it might be different for you!\nstudent: I can type extremely fast (90 words per minute), so I have some time to read and edit ;)\nstudent: The other day I went for a hike with some friends, I was struggling a bit because I was carrying one of my children and we were going quite fast...and I noticed how my language was breaking so badly\nteacher: Haha, good for you! I hate noticing my typoes when I'm annotating afterwards. I tend to omit whole words\nstudent: Both grammar-wise and pronunciation-wise...\nteacher: Yes! I can imagine, and the same with sleep deprivation and other stresses and strains\nstudent: Haha...well, that's also true...but I must say that it is going a bit better now that the children are a bit older and that the weather is improving...\nstudent: they are also starting to play together, which helps a lot\nteacher: Wonderful! We're having a mini-heatwave, it's going to be +18 tomorrow!\nteacher: Oh I bet, yes!\nstudent: Here it is already +16, considering two weeks ago we were reaching -12 I am happy...but also a bit worried about the climate...\nteacher: When you went hiking, did you go somewhere where there aren't many people? Off the beaten ....?\nteacher: Yes, they are saying this extremely cold winter is actually the result of the Arctic warming. Scary stuff!\nstudent: off the beaten track? No, it was a well know track which brings you to a restaurant...\nstudent: which was closed...but I guess that was okay to start hiking again this year\nteacher: Yes, off the beaten track :)\nstudent: (would you use 'break the ice' in that expression? Meaning it had been a while since the last time we went hiking?)\nteacher: Ha, we're not even allowed those! Unless it's within 5 miles from home (whinge whinge whinge)\nstudent: Restaurants here are closed too, until the end of the month I think\nteacher: I wouldn't, actually. You break the ice between some people. Like, if your friends and you had been on the rocks, the hike could have broken the ice\nstudent: I see...in Italian we have an expression with the same literal meaning, to break the ice, but which we use in general whenever we initiate something that wasn't there (or hadn't been there for a while)...\nteacher: Or things like 'it might be good to start a presentation with a joke, to break the ice'\nstudent: even though it is mostly used with people...\nteacher: Hmm, I'm thinking what it could be in English... I know what you're trying to say. It'll come to me, hopefully!\nstudent: About breaking the ice, one of the dumbest pick up lines I have heard is going to a girl/boy and ask him/her: 'Do you know how much a penguin weighs?' 'No' 'Enough to break the ice'...\nstudent: I know it is dumb, but I find it extremely funny...\nteacher: Haha, I'll tell my husband, he'll love it!\nteacher: Can you spot a mistake in the question about the penguin?\nstudent: I was unsure about whether the verb at the end should be 'weight' or 'weigh'\nteacher: the verb is weigh, you're right. Weight is the noun, but there's also a grammar mistake...\nstudent: Oh my, I can't find it!\nteacher: How much does a penguin weigh? ---- Do you know how much ....\nstudent: Hmmm, maybe I shouldn't use the 'does' and instead use weigh in 3rd person?\nstudent: a penguin weighs\nstudent: weighs\nteacher: a penguin weighs!\nteacher: Yes, of course, it's a reported question\nteacher: Is it one of those that you know intuitively but aren't sure about the rules?\nstudent: I see...so 'How much does a penguin weigh?' becomes 'Do you know how much a penguin weighs?'\nteacher: Yes, that's right!\nstudent: I would say so...and, in this particular case, I was extremely unsure because of weigh, weight and how it is pronounced\nteacher: Ah, maybe that confused you. I'll make a note to prep some material on reported speech for you for the next time, I'm sure you know and use most of it, but it might be useful to brush up\nstudent: Absolutely, thank you!\nteacher: Do you read phonemic symbols? /we\u026a/ for weigh\nteacher: And /we\u026at/ for weight\nteacher: Weight is like the number eight with /w/ at the start\nteacher: And weigh is like weight without the /t/\nteacher: Weigh rhymes with may and play\nteacher: Weight rhymes with 8 :)\nstudent: I have never learned how to read them properly...even though I have used them a bit and so I know some of them...\nteacher: They can be useful, but these days good dictionaries (like Cambridge English Dictionary online) have recordings you can listen to\nteacher: One sec, I'll find the phonemic alphabet for you\nteacher: Here it is. A bit nerdy but I like it :) You can read any word as long as you can see a phonemic transcription\nstudent: Thank you! I guess I will study it then! It will also be useful for my work, actually...\nteacher: In Ukraine children are taught it at the ripe age of 7 :)\nteacher: Ok, good!\nstudent: one of my interests is grammar and spelling corrections, so I need to generate 'realistic' mistakes...\nstudent: Really? In Italian we don't need them, I guess, since each character has its sound...\nteacher: Yes, it's what your AI is focussing on, right?\nstudent: plus some combinations of letters...\nstudent: One of the projects I work on does that, yes.\nteacher: Oh, I mean for English. Grammar and phonetic transcriptions, we're hardcore\nteacher: This is the work of a linguist and English teacher who streamlined the phonemic alphabet for English\nstudent: Cool! I will read it then :)\nteacher: As he points out, the symbols are international. Other languages have other sounds (and other symbols), but in theory, you should be able to transcribe any word in any language using the full version of the phonetic alphabet\nteacher: like the Periodic Table\nstudent: I think it is funny that one of the aliases of Frodo Baggings, in The Lord of the Rings, is 'Mr. Underhill'\nteacher: Really? hobbits did live under hills :))) Which one? I only remember first names\nstudent: Frodo Baggins, the one carrying the ring, has to hide his name at the beginning of his voyage...and so Gandalf suggests that he should be Mr. Underhill\nteacher: Aah, I'm with you! I thought you meant 'allies'\nstudent: oh, I see...\nteacher: Makes sense now :)\nteacher: Ok, I think we've got time for another Cambridge Proficiency exercise!\nteacher: Have you got the pdf handy?\nstudent: Yes, one second\nstudent: Ready :) Which excercise shall we do?\nteacher: Could you go to part 2, please? 'mobile communication'\nstudent: Okay...\nteacher: You haven't got any options this time, like in the first one, the multiple choice one\nteacher: Which word goes in each gap? One word per gap, please\nstudent: okay!\nstudent: 9) why\nstudent: 10) After\nstudent: 11) between\nstudent: 12) time\nstudent: 13) on\nstudent: 14) .... (I'll do it later) 15) as 16) place\nstudent: hmm 14....more\nteacher: Yes, perfect!! I'll let you ponder 14\nteacher: Yes!! absolutely! congratulations :)\nteacher: a nice fast task :)\nstudent: Oh, did I do everything correctly? Thank you!\nteacher: This one was obviously written pre-pandemic...\nteacher: Yes, you did!\nstudent: Haha...indeed...\nstudent: Should I try the other one?\nstudent: power naps?\nteacher: Ok, in this case let's tackle the next one (my favourite). You need to make new words out of the words on the right, to fill the gaps. It's important to be careful about the form of the words too (plurals, third person endings, etc.)\nteacher: And the meaning (negative prefixes, maybe suffixes meaning the lack of...)\nstudent: Okay...let's try...\nteacher: Yes please!\nstudent: 17) alertness 18) executives\nstudent: 19) maximize\nstudent: 20) disorientation\nstudent: 21) comparatively\nstudent: 22) designed\nstudent: 23) accompany (I'm unsure about the spelling)\nstudent: 24) desperation ...I am really unsure about this one...\nstudent: Can I keep the words, without changing them?\nteacher: Nooo! You've got to change them :) and desperation is correct!\nteacher: Can you check the spelling of 21, please?\nstudent: comparatively\nstudent: that was a typo...\nteacher: Yes, correct! I thought so\nteacher: Only one is wrong! 22\nstudent: Hmm...really? predesigned? I don't know...\nteacher: Ah, no. designated\nteacher: if you decide to wake up at 1 pm, 1 pm is your designated time\nstudent: Oh...now I see...okay...\nteacher: The front seats on a bus a designated for people with disabilities\nteacher: etc.\nteacher: Ok, but it's a great result, congratulations!\nstudent: Thank you :)\nteacher: I'll let you go now. Same time next week?\nstudent: Yes, I'll write it down again on the paper calendar ;)\nstudent: Thank you for the lesson! Have a nice afternoon!\nstudent: and a nice week\nteacher: Haha, yes, an analog medium\nteacher: Thanks, you too! Speak to you then!",
    "student: hi\nstudent: sorry for being late\nteacher: Hi Emma Smith!\nteacher: No worries, all ok with you?\nstudent: yeah\nteacher: Good! How are you? Is spring coming to Kyiv yet?\nstudent: I am fine, and yes spring is coming\nstudent: a bit warmer now\nteacher: Nice, isn't it? It's warmer here too, and birds are singing!\nstudent: and snow is turning into water\nstudent: yes, they are!\nteacher: Ha, yes, water and slush\nteacher: The snow that's started to melt is called slush, like a drink\nstudent: my boots were wet yesterday\nteacher: Yes, Kyiv winters are hard on footwear, I remember that!\nteacher: Are you about to have a school holiday soon? Or have you just had one? There is a holiday in February, right?\nstudent: hi again\nteacher: Hi Emma Smith!\nstudent: I am so sorry that I left, I was on my way home and my phone battery said goodbye\nstudent: now I am okay\nteacher: Oh no! Are you home now?\nstudent: and the next holiday will be at the end of March\nstudent: yeah I am home\nteacher: Ok, let's say for the future, if you're not home yet, just text me on Skype to say that you'll be late, ok? It doesn't sound safe to me to be chatting on the go / on public transport\nstudent: I am okay, no problem\nstudent: if something happens I will tell you\nteacher: I know, but still, no chatting on the go, ok?\nstudent: okay\nteacher: Cool!\nteacher: Do you remember the word from earlier? When snow melts it turns into....\nteacher: before it becomes water\nstudent: slush\nteacher: Yes, well done :)\nteacher: I don't like slush\nstudent: my footwear is wet again\nstudent: it is wet only because of the one same place\nteacher: Oh no! You probably don't like this weather either?\nstudent: yeah\nteacher: I want to talk today about ways to agree\nstudent: but I don't really hate it because it is an atmosphere of spring\nstudent: okay\nteacher: In English, there are different ways to agree depending on whether the statement is affirmative (+) or negative (-)\nteacher: Ah, yes, I know what you mean!\nteacher: For example, A says,\nteacher: I love spring!' And B agrees, 'So do I!' or 'Me too'\nteacher: You probably know 'me too', don't you?\nstudent: I do\nteacher: I love spring' is an affirmative statement (it hasn't got 'don't' in it)\nteacher: But if A says, 'I don't like slush', B agrees, 'Neither do I!' or 'Me neither!'\nteacher: we can't use 'me too' to agree with a negative statement\nteacher: Have you heard 'me neither' before?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Ok, cool, it's familiar then!\nteacher: As you've probably noticed, with 'So do I' and 'Neither do I' we use 'do', the auxiliary verb that works in the original sentence\nteacher: And it changes depending on a sentence!\nteacher: I used to like lollipops.  -So did I!\nteacher: I didn't go to this party. - Neither did I\nteacher: See what happens with the verb?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Ok, can you guess the verb please?\nteacher: I am at home right now. - So ___ I\nstudent: am\nteacher: Yes)\nteacher: Fred is very funny. - So __ George\nstudent: is?\nteacher: Yes :) It's not only about 'I'\nteacher: I have never been to South America. - Neither ____ I\nstudent: have\nteacher: Well done!\nteacher: I'd love to go somewhere I've never been before!   - So ___ I\nstudent: do\nteacher: Hmm, have another think. What's the auxiliary verb in 'I'd love to'?\nstudent: would?\nstudent: will\nteacher: Yes, well done! So would I\nstudent: yeah\nstudent: okay\nteacher: I'd love to = I would love to\nstudent: makes sense\nteacher: Now, obviously, 'me too' and 'me neither' is a simpler option because you don't have to use the auxiliary at all\nteacher: Let's practise both options! I'm going to give you some statements that I think you might agree with and you agree (but you can always disagree if they are not true for you!)\nteacher: I feel more hopeful when spring is in the air!\nstudent: so do I\nteacher: :)\nteacher: I don't like horror films!\nstudent: I am not so sure about it hehe\nteacher: Do you mean you're not sure about the grammar or you don't agree with me completely?\nstudent: agree\nteacher: Got you, let's try another one\nstudent: like I watched some horror films but I am not sure\nteacher: I don't think HP films are as good as the books.\nteacher: Fair enough!\nstudent: Neither do I\nteacher: Yaay, good!\nteacher: And what's the simple option?\nteacher: Neither do I = ?\nstudent: me neither\nteacher: Well done, Emma Smith :)\nteacher: Ok, I'll let you go, we can practise a bit more next week! Have a lovely week, speak to you next Tuesday!\nstudent: okay, bye bye!\nteacher: Bye!",
    "student: Hi, Ms. Katherine Nguyen!\nteacher: Morning!\nteacher: How are you doing?\nstudent: Fine, thank you\nstudent: The weather is awful. It's about +1 in the day and - 1 at night\nstudent: Lots of water on the street because the snow is melting\nteacher: Oh yes, another student from Kyiv told me that all snow is turning into slush and it's very wet\nstudent: how are you?\nstudent: slush? )\nteacher: Ok, thank you! Boris gave us 'a roadmap out of lockdown'\nteacher: Yes, it's melting snow mixed with mud and water\nteacher: Like a drink\nstudent: do you have another student from Kyiv? I thought I'm the only one )))\nstudent: It's a joke\nstudent: )\nteacher: I have three altogether!\nstudent: a roadmap out of lockdown'?\nteacher: Yes, a plan of how restrictions are going to be lifted, one by one\nstudent: alas! I don't know the expression ))\nteacher: The first one is happening on March 8, schools are re-opening\nteacher: Haha, yes, alas))\nstudent: aha\nstudent: fine!\nstudent: and then?\nteacher: Then March 29, we will be allowed to travel out of local areas (but it's better not to they say, haha)\nteacher: Then mid-April, non-essential shops and hairdressers open\nstudent: Ms. Katherine Nguyen : Then March 29, we will be allowed to travel out of local areas (but it's better not to they say, haha)\nteacher: Then mid-May, you can go somewhere and stay overnight, for example at a hotel or with family\nstudent: sorry, why is it better not to they say?\nteacher: Before mid-May, people from different households are not allowed to mix indoors\nteacher: Well, you're allowed to travel, but better stay at home...\nteacher: Finally, if everything goes well, on June 21 all the remaining restrictions will be lifted!\nstudent: Ah! I see\nstudent: You mean that lots of people will start travelling even if it's not necessary?\nteacher: It's a long journey, but there is light at the end of the tunnel!\nstudent: necessary\nteacher: Hmm, as I understand, police won't stop people if they go somewhere, but people are still encouraged to be cautious\nstudent: I see\nstudent: Sorry\nteacher: But even after June there are still going to be restrictions on international travel and there will be social distancing\nteacher: What's it like in Kyiv at the moment? In terms of infections?\nstudent: I forgot to wear my contact lens\nstudent: One moment\nstudent: )\nteacher: Ok, no prob!\nstudent: ok\nstudent: here I am )\nteacher: Ok, great!\nstudent: with the lens and the glasses )\nstudent: sorry\nteacher: So what's it like in Ukraine? Is vaccination taking place at all?\nstudent: ok\nteacher: no worries!\nstudent: I think now we have a stable situation here in Kyiv\nteacher: Ok, sounds good!\nstudent: I mean some number of people have Covid, but the number is ok\nteacher: It seems like lots of your friends and some family have had it\nstudent: I know that usually my friends are afraid for their parents\nstudent: But young people usually are not afraid to catch the disease\nstudent: Ok! I would say 50/50\nteacher: Right, which probably means they are not very careful with social distancing and rules, right?\nstudent: And it's interesting because the half who hasn't had it has a very intense lifestyle\nstudent: Ms. Katherine Nguyen : Right, which probably means they are not very careful with social distancing and rules, right?  - I don't think so\nstudent: Even the opposite\nteacher: Oh, I just meant, if people are not worried about covid, they are less likely to social distance. I wasn't trying to say that your friends were careless!\nstudent: Aha! I mean that for me there isn't logic. Some of my friends have to work at the office and they meet lots of people because of their work, but they still haven't had Covid\nstudent: But there are others who work from home and have minimal contacts and they have had Covid\nteacher: I see! The irony! I guess just one contact may be enough, if it's with an infected person\nstudent: \u041d\u0443\u044b!\nstudent: Yes!\nstudent: And what do you think about the opinion that children can't infect anyone?\nteacher: They say primary school children (under 11) are less likely to spread the disease than older children and adults\nstudent: My mother-in-law told me\nteacher: I mean, they've done studies on this now because it's so important to know, here in the UK\nstudent: *mother-in-law\nteacher: Yes, scientists here are of the same opinion it seems\nstudent: But I have a friend from Switzerland, she is a therapist and she works at a nursery\nteacher: That's why we're not too worried about Caleb going back to school. I ____ be more worried if David _____ back to work (but he isn't going back yet).\nteacher: What goes in the gaps?\nstudent: And she thinks that kids just don't have symptoms, but they can spread the disease to adults\nstudent: That's why we're not too worried about Caleb going back to school. I would be more worried if David went back to work (but he isn't going back yet).\nstudent: I didn't check the rule )\nteacher: I would be more worried = yes\nteacher: if David ______ (past simple)\nstudent: It's a second conditional\nteacher: Yes, it is!\nstudent: if David went (past simple)\nstudent: went back?\nteacher: Yes, went back! Well done:)\nstudent: have back to work' doesn't make sense?\nteacher: No, it doesn't really\nteacher: go back to work\nteacher: Oh, is your friend from Switzerland a therapist or a doctor?\nteacher: You know how in English a therapist is a psychotherapist?\nstudent: Yes! She is a therapist\nstudent: Not a doctor )\nteacher: Ah, ok! sure! I just didn't expect there to be a therapist at a nursery!\nstudent: Ok! I mean she is an adult therapist and she works at the nursery consulting parents\nteacher: Nice that they have such a service, sounds really good!\nstudent: It looks like she observes the kids and then she consults their parents\nstudent: Something like this\nteacher: Do you know the word for a 'general' doctor? Who doesn't specialise in one particular area and who people go to see first, before a specialist?\nstudent: She has qualifications in different areas of therapy I think.\nstudent: family doctor\nstudent: ?\nteacher: Nice, makes sense. It's just a 'false friend' for many speakers of Russian, that's why I decided to make sure ))\nteacher: Ah, yes, it's called a family doctor in Ukraine now, isn't it? It actually depends on a country\nstudent: and a physician?\nteacher: Yes, a physician in the US!\nteacher: And a GP in the UK\nstudent: Yes! In Ukraine we have family doctors now\nteacher: GP = general practitioner\nstudent: Ah! I see! Yes\nstudent: I remember now\nteacher: Yes, of course, I've heard! And it's one doctor for children and adults, isn't it?\nstudent: Alexandra told me\nstudent: )\nteacher: Yes, and a place where you can find them is called 'a GP surgery'\nstudent: Ok, I'm not sure\nteacher: Even though it's got nothing to do with a surgery. To have a surgery, people would go to a hospital\nstudent: You see, we have had a contract with a private clinic since Sophia was born\nstudent: And they have the staff just for kids\nteacher: (good present perfect :)\nstudent: )))\nteacher: Ok, pediatricians?\nstudent: Yes, pediatricians!\nstudent: As for us usually if we need a general advice we ask my mother-in-law\nteacher: Haha, yes, of course!\nteacher: Yes, I'm thinking now, it must have been hard to switch to family doctors in Ukraine, since all doctors are either pediatricians or adult doctors\nstudent: And if we need some special examination we go to special clinics or doctors\nstudent: Usually on recommendation from a friend or family\nteacher: Here, a GP is expected to know about babies, children and adults. And if there is something they don't know, they can refer to a pediatrician, for example\nstudent: Aha, I see\nteacher: Yes, if a GP can't help, they refer a patient to a specialist\nteacher: The verb is 'to refer someone to someone' (to refer a child to a pediatrician)\nteacher: And the noun is\nstudent: Unfortunately, I have a very poor knowledge of our system of family doctors\nteacher: a referral\nteacher: Yes, it's so new, this system, isn't it?\nstudent: I think we've had it for several years\nteacher: Ooh, give me a present perfect, please :)\nstudent: \u0446\u0443 \u0440\u0444\u043c\u0443 \u0440\u0444\u0432 )\nstudent: we have had )\nteacher: yes!\nstudent: But lots of people still don't have a contract with a family doctor like me or Jacob for example\nteacher: I see! Yes, I wonder if it's not enough time to re-train doctors from specialising in children / adults to a more general approach\nstudent: I think it's because in Ukraine people don't trust the state medical system\nteacher: Yes, unfortunately\nteacher: Ok, a quick grammar moment!\nstudent: It's a huge problem here\nteacher: I wonder if it's not enough time to re-train doctors.\nstudent: ok!\nteacher: If we remove 'I wonder' and make a question, what would the question be? ___ ____ ____ _____ time to re-train doctors?\nstudent: Is it not enough time to re-train doctors?\nteacher: Yes! well-done!\nteacher: I don't know what the situation is like.\nteacher: If we lose 'I don't know', what will the question be?\nstudent: ok\nstudent: one more question\nteacher: go ahead!\nstudent: do I need if after I wonder?\nteacher: Ah, we'll go back to it in a second, ok?\nstudent: ok!\nstudent: ok\nstudent: the question is\nstudent: what is the situation like?\nteacher: Nearly! What ___ the situation like?\nstudent: What is the situation like?\nteacher: Yes!\nteacher: One more\nteacher: I don't know when he will be home. Again, lose 'I don't know'\nstudent: When will he be home?\nstudent: hm\nstudent: I'm not sure\nteacher: Yes, correct!\nteacher: I don't know if he will like this movie\nteacher: same idea)\nstudent: Will he like the movie?\nteacher: Yes, well done!\nteacher: So when do we use 'if'?\nteacher: Will he like the movie? vs. When will he be home?\nstudent: with the movie )\nstudent: when we don't have a special question word?\nteacher: Correct!\nstudent: I see )\nstudent: now )\nteacher: You know what, we'll have a proper look at it on Friday, ok?\nstudent: It's a good idea )\nteacher: Lovely!\nstudent: So see you on Friday )\nteacher: I'll speak to you then, have a good day! :)\nstudent: Have a good day )\nstudent: thank you\nteacher: Thank you, bye!))\nstudent: bye xx",
    "teacher: Morning!\nstudent: How are you?\nstudent: Sorry for being late\nteacher: All good, thank you!\nteacher: And you?\nstudent: Fine, thank you!\nteacher: No worries. Hopefully, in a week's time we can go back to lunchtime classes\nstudent: Busy Friday as usual )\nteacher: Are you continuing with your marketing course?\nstudent: I finished that one and now I'm watching another one from a famous Ukrainian marketing ___ (who?)\nteacher: guru? :)\nteacher: expert?\nstudent: It's called 'the papa brand'\nteacher: It's called...\nstudent: haha! ) Let's take 'expert' )\nstudent: Oh no, of course!\nstudent: It's called\nstudent: I don't like the name actually )\nteacher: a marketing guru is actually a nice collocation, it works\nteacher: Yes, it's weird! Why is called that?\nstudent: He mentioned that he didn't mean just men, but I still don't think that it's the best name for a course )\nstudent: He talks a lot about how it is important when the owner works with marketing stuff in the company\nteacher: Haha, oh goodness. It's like everything for parents is called 'mummy and baby' or something like that, and then they say, we don't mean just mothers! Well, call it something more inclusive then!\nstudent: A papa is an owner\nstudent: And a company is like a baby\nteacher: Ok, I see, rather than just hires a marketing manager?\nstudent: Well, call it something more inclusive then!  - Agree!\nteacher: Ok, back to 'it's called' for a second. It's a bit weird for speakers of Russian!\nstudent: Ok, he thinks that you can hire someone, but as an owner you don't have to think that it's an area just for your marketing director or someone like that\nteacher: The company is called X. Question: What is it called?\nteacher: not 'how' like in Russian\nstudent: ok! I see\nteacher: And the same idea if you don't know a word in English,for example, you can ask, What it it called? or What do you call?\nteacher: What is the ability to move quickly and skilfully called in English?\nstudent: sorry\nstudent: 5 min\nteacher: What do you call a person who can use both hands equally well?\nstudent: Oh\nstudent: Sorry sorry\nteacher: Everything ok?\nstudent: It was a call from a potential client from the Embassy of Korea\nstudent: I had to answer\nteacher: Ooh, important!\nstudent: I'm very sorry\nteacher: Don't worry about it!\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: Are they interested?\nstudent: She would like to take a course to pass TORFL\nstudent: TRKI 2 or 3\nteacher: to take a course?\nstudent: But actually I hear that TRKI 3 is not for her )\nstudent: to take a course\nstudent: of course!\nteacher: Sure!\nstudent: Ok! What do you call a person who can use both hands equally well?\nstudent: ambidexter )\nteacher: Is it the exam you showed me? With really old-fashioned texts for reading? like Turgenev etc.\nstudent: Petrov is an ambidexter ))\nstudent: Mr. Johnson : Is it the exam you showed me? With really old-fashioned texts for reading? like Turgenev etc.  - Yes!!!! ))\nstudent: It's an awful test with strange materials and questions )\nteacher: Haha, yes, such a good joke! It's an adjective in English, actually. Ambidextrous\nstudent: Don't you have a noun?\nteacher: Well, yes, but it means something else!\nteacher: It means someone who takes bribes from both sides\nstudent: Ah! Wow! Interesting )\nteacher: Do you know 'a bribe'?\nstudent: Ok, I see\nteacher: Well, it can mean someone who is ambidextrous\nstudent: It's not fair to call Petrov ambidexter ))\nteacher: Maybe Petrov didn't deserve it! :)))\nstudent: yes )))\nteacher: But especially a lawyer who takes fees from both sides\nteacher: Anyway, let's go back to our indirect questions while we still have some time!\nstudent: It's very interesting ) I mean the meaning of the word )\nteacher: I know, it is, isn't it?\nstudent: ok! I'm ready!\nteacher: Ok, could you turn these two questions into sentences that start with 'I don't know...'\nteacher: What time does the show start?\nteacher: Is the show on Sunday?\nstudent: I don't know what time the snow starts\nteacher: Yes!\nstudent: I don't know if the snow is on Sunday\nteacher: Yaay! Well done :)\nteacher: If there's no question word, we use 'if', but we can also use 'whether'\nteacher: I don't know whether the show is on Sunday\nteacher: #ERROR!\nteacher: But you obviously remember that we need the grammar of an affirmative sentence, not a question\nteacher: like in reported speech\nstudent: Ok! I see!\nteacher: Strictly speaking, reported speech is things like 'He said that...' but we use the same rule much more often in 'I don't know...' and 'I wonder...' sentences\nteacher: Also, we use the same rule to ask indirect questions\nteacher: When we don't know the person very well, or we want to be extra polite, we start a question with 'Could you tell me...' or 'Do you know...'\nteacher: For example, a client might write to you and ask, 'Could you tell me whether you school can help me prepare for this exam?'\nteacher: What they mean is, 'Can you school help me prepare for this exam?', but they are being extra polite\nstudent: I see!\nteacher: It's also useful when asking for help / talking to receptionists / flight attendants / sales people/ bank managers etc. etc.\nteacher: But of course, even if you don't know a person very well, you won't say, 'Could you tell me how you are?' or things like that :)\nstudent: ok\nstudent: so\nteacher: Ok, let's practise a bit! I'm going to give you a question, and you turn it into an indirect question, starting with 'Could you tell me...' or 'Do you know...'\nstudent: I have to be polite all the time you mean? )))\nstudent: It's a joke )\nstudent: I'm ready!\nteacher: Nooo)))) But you know how speakers of English find speakers of Slavic languages too direct? I think it's because in Russian, for example, we express politeness with 'vy', but it's lost when translated into English\nteacher: So it's worth learning about English ways to express politeness\nteacher: For example, in Russian we would say, 'Skazhite, pozhaluysta, gde vokzal'\nstudent: Agree!\nteacher: Which is polite because of '-te'\nstudent: And we use intonation. But not a different structure\nteacher: but people translate it into English as 'Tell me please where the station is'\nstudent: *not\nteacher: Oops, not so polite!\nteacher: Yes!\nteacher: Ok, let's start with this one! Where is the railway station? Could you tell me...\nstudent: Could you tell me where the railway station is?\nstudent: Could you tell me, please, where the railway station is?\nteacher: Nearly! Can you check the word order in the second part?\nstudent: Do I need please here?\nstudent: Oh, sorry\nstudent: where the railway station is?\nteacher: Yes, you can use please when you actually talk, but we can skip it in the chat to save time\nteacher: Yes!\nteacher: Has Lucy been to Mexico?\nteacher: Do you know...\nstudent: Do you know whether Lucy has been to Mexico?\nstudent: just TO Mexico here?\nteacher: Yes! one last!\nstudent: I know it's a different subject )\nteacher: Yes, I'll make a note to talk about it next time))\nteacher: Did Amanda call John yesterday?\nstudent: Thank you )\nstudent: Do you know if Amanda called John yesterday?\nteacher: Correct! Well done!\nteacher: Ok, I'll let you get on with your busy Friday! Good luck!\nstudent: Thank you!!!\nstudent: Have a good weekend xx\nstudent: bye!\nteacher: Thanks, you too! Bye! :)",
    "student: Hello!\nteacher: Hiya!\nstudent: How do you do?\nteacher: Good to have you here, and thanks again for agreeing to change the time!\nstudent: No problem\nstudent: Nice to see you\nteacher: All good, thank you! It's the last week of the really strict lockdown, it's going to be *just* strict starting from the 8th\nstudent: Quick question before I forget. What will be the English equivalent of '\u0418\u0434\u0438 \u043a\u043e \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0443\u043a\u0438'?\nteacher: Let me think!\nstudent: Good news! Are schools going to work?\nteacher: I think it depends on whether we mean being on someone's lap or being in someone's arms, both of which are  'na ruki' in Russian, aren't they?\nteacher: So I would say 'Come sit on my lap' or 'Come, I'll pick you up / come have a cuddle'\nteacher: Yes, schools are re-opening!\nstudent: Right. I'll pick you up was what I meant in Russian\nstudent: I knew the lap one\nstudent: And what would you say is '\u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0443\u043a\u0430\u0445 \u0443 \u043f\u0430\u043f\u044b' ?\nteacher: I suppose 'on the lap' is 'na kolenyakh'. Or do we say 'na ruki' too? I can't remember!!\nteacher: I would say, her Dad's holding her\nstudent: I think we say '\u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0443\u043a\u0438' for on the lap\nteacher: Yeah, we do, don't we? Weird...\nstudent: I see. So there isn't really a word for upper \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0443\u043a\u0430\u0445.\nstudent: We use it so very often I notice\nteacher: Haha, upper na rukakh :)) well, you can say 'in his arms', but it doesn't actually convey the idea of being held\nteacher: without feet touching the ground\nstudent: Right\nstudent: \u0421\u0438\u0434\u0435\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0443\u043a\u0430\u0445\nstudent: A tough one\nstudent: You sit in my arms\nteacher: Yes, it definitely is! Poor students of Russian! It makes very little sense\nteacher: Oops, sorry, the chatroom crashed\nstudent: The chat crashed\nstudent: yep\nteacher: yep\nstudent: That's fine\nstudent: haha\nteacher: I know))\nstudent: Half of what I type doesn't go through\nteacher: So again, I think 'in someone's arms' is just this idea of an embrace\nteacher: Oh really? Is it any better now?\nstudent: I see\nstudent: Better!\nteacher: Like, when we dance, I hold you in my arms bla bla bla (as a song cliche)\nteacher: So you can definitely hold a child in your arms, but, if I was describing a picture of a child who is 'na rukakh', I would say, the mother / father is holding them\nstudent: Right\nstudent: Thank you for clarifying\nteacher: No worries at all\nteacher: Good news! Are the schools going to work? - can you spot an extra word?\nstudent: the?\nteacher: Yes! pesky articles\nteacher: Because you mean schools in general, all schools, right?\nstudent: Right. A silly mistake)\nteacher: No, not silly, articles are a really difficult subject\nstudent: Yes, too many rules and exceptions\nteacher: Speaking of which, I've got a choice for you today. Would you like to look at 'the or no article' in the 'orange' book or finish off the writing?\nstudent: The orange book please\nstudent: I have it with me\nteacher: Lovely! one sec\nteacher: p. 130. Could you read the first section and tell me if there's anything new / interesting there?\nstudent: one sec\nstudent: Logic is not always a reliable guide -- pretty much sums up the whole 'Articles' grammar section\nteacher: I know, this is the best sentence :))\nteacher: Still, the idea that helps me is to think of 'the' as a short form of this/that/these/those\nstudent: Ok. Read it, refreshed it in my memory\nteacher: Basically, if you can replace an article with this / that / these / those, you probably need a 'the'. As opposed to 'any' (a / no article)\nteacher: Ok! Section 2?\nstudent: one sec\nstudent: what is piety?\nteacher: It's being very religious\nteacher: strong belief in a religion that is shown in the way someone lives\nteacher: says Cambridge English Dictionary\nteacher: not just having faith, but having a lifestyle that demonstrates it\nteacher: the adjective is pious\nstudent: Does it come close to the Russian \u043f\u0438\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0442 I wonder\nteacher: Yep, that's where \u043f\u0438\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0442 comes from :) but itn\nstudent: Great. Thanks!\nstudent: Ok. I read Section 2\nteacher: in Russian it means respect / deference rather than being very religious I think\nstudent: Right. A little different in meaning\nteacher: Ok, cool! Section 3 is very good, I love the examples\nstudent: I like the one with 'on the brain;\nteacher: Hmm, maybe you've got different examples!\nteacher: Which one is it?\nstudent: Emily watches some crazy cartoons with very catchy tunes\nstudent: I've got this annoying tune on the brain'\nteacher: I haven't got this one :( that's a shame, it means our books are slightly different!\nstudent: In the 'Parts of the Body' section\nstudent: That's fine. Actually, they only add a couple of examples and call it a new edition\nteacher: Wow! I haven't got this section!\nstudent: Section 3?\nstudent: Mine is 2008\nteacher: My section 3 is just 'General or specific - adding the'\nstudent: What year is your copy?\nstudent: I've got Section 3 -- Classifying\nteacher: Ah, mine is 2000, that'll be it\nteacher: Ah, I see, I think there's a separate unit of classifying\nteacher: Are you still on page 130?\nstudent: Do you have Section 4?\nstudent: p.134\nteacher: nope, I've got a picture of a grown-up son who crashed dad's car\nstudent: Oh I have it too\nstudent: It's in Section 1\nteacher: Oh goodness, I know what happened! When I said 'section', I didn't actually mean the whole page, I meant one paragraph. Sorry, entirely my fault! I just made you read three pages of rules :(((\nstudent: haha)) No worries. I enjoyed it!\nteacher: Good! Sorry about that...\nteacher: Let's go back to practice, page 131 please\nstudent: OK\nstudent: Which task?\nteacher: I thought it was taking you a little longer than I expected to read a paragraph...\nstudent: haha\nteacher: the killer exercise 1 please\nstudent: Ok\nstudent: 10 fun\nstudent: 1) fun\nteacher: wait a sec\nteacher: Sorry, page 130! it's 131 in the pdf, but you have the hard copy of the book, don't you?\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: Sorry, my bad again! page 130 ex. 1\nstudent: What's the task about?\nteacher: The one that starts with 'there are countless varieties...'\nteacher: Write in the where necessary'\nstudent: Can't seem to find it\nteacher: Ok, sure, one sec\nteacher: There are countless varieties of English in use in English-speaking world.\nteacher: Is the missing anywhere in this sentence?\nstudent: the English-speaking world\nteacher: Yes!\nteacher: Concepts of language vary from country to country and from generation to generation; English you hear nowadays is no way recognisable as language spoken by last generation, let alone in time of Shakespear.\nteacher: *in no way recognisable\nstudent: Only 1 the is missing?\nteacher: No, more than one!\nstudent: The concepts, the English, the language spoken, the last generation\nstudent: in the time\nteacher: Yes, except for the concepts\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: I think 'of language' is not defining enough\nteacher: because in the singular we could say 'a concept of language'\nteacher: so no article in the plural\nteacher: Ok, I've got to let you go. Thanks for bearing with me through 3 pages of unintended grammar assault! :)\nstudent: It was quite a refresher\nstudent: Thank you for explaining some grammar to me!\nteacher: :) Ok, thanks, I'll message you later!\nteacher: Take care!\nstudent: Thank you! Bye!\nstudent: You too",
    "student: Hello!\nteacher: Hi Emily Brown!\nteacher: How's it going?\nstudent: Everything good thank you :) How about you?\nteacher: Good, thank you! The lockdown's been getting to me this week though...\nstudent: Oh, I am sorry about that...do you know how long it will last?\nteacher: Well, schools are re-opening next Monday, which is some normality I suppose. And I'll be able to see other people at pick-up and drop-off!\nteacher: We bought a new car a few weeks ago, but we aren't allowed to go anywhere until March 29\nteacher: Which is going to be the second phase of unlocking\nstudent: Well, school is a start..to think that now we are counting on the opportunity to see other parents when bringing children to school...\nteacher: I know, goodness! Just to see other human beings!\nstudent: I see...here things are more relaxed now, but you need to do a quick test for almost everything...for istance, if I want to go to the office, I have to test every second day.\nteacher: I'm very lucky to be locked down with a family, of course. I can't imagine what it's like for single people!\nstudent: I agree on that one..sometimes I wish for some silence but, to be honest, I believe people living alone have it much harder...\nteacher: Hmm, interesting! The country must be well stocked up on instant tests\nteacher: Have you been going to the office?\nteacher: Yes, you seem way ahead in terms of being out of lockdown! They haven't even offered a timeframe on the return to offices here\nstudent: Yes, they are aiming at doing 3 million per week or so, in a country with something like 8.5 million inhabitants.\nteacher: Is that all? I thought Austria had a bigger population!\nteacher: There are about 66 million in the UK\nstudent: So far I haven't been: it has opened starting from today, but I couldn't get the test done...my wife had the AstraZeneca vaccine and suffered from a bad fever as a side effect...\nstudent: so the last three days were intense ;)\nteacher: Oh I see, sorry to hear that!! Hope she'll feel better very soon!\nstudent: Today she is better, in fact she is currently out with the children...some silence, finally ;)\nstudent: Yes, Austria is small..especially when you think that Wien and its surroundings count 2.5 million inhabitants...\nteacher: Interesting! English people spell it 'Vienna'\nstudent: You are right, Italian people do too...and also Austrian actually...\nstudent: I don't know why I went for the German spelling...\nteacher: Anyway, the vaccine is a milestone even if it comes at a cost, congratulations to your wife!\nstudent: Thanks :)\nteacher: The Austrians spell it differently from the Germans? I didn't know that either\nstudent: One thing that I can't really understand is that in Italy they consider University staff as high priority, so a lot of my ex-colleagues have been vaccinated...even though they are working remotely most of the time and barely see anyone\nstudent: The official German is Wien, I believe...but Austrian tend to have also 'their' version of some words...\nstudent: And I have heard them say Vienna..\nteacher: Ah, they've adopted the occupation-based approach then. It's strictly age-based in the UK, the only exception being people with medical conditions that make them more vulnerable\nstudent: Yes, but currently they are vaccinating people over 80, medical staff...and then, before school teachers (who see their pupils at school) they went for university staff...\nteacher: I've been thinking about you saying 'silence', as in a break from the kids. I would use 'quiet' instead. Or 'peace and quiet'\nstudent: I don't really understand the ratio...but then, there is little I can do, I only hope that things will speed up :)\nstudent: Oh, okay...I guess silence is more of a literary word?\nteacher: Oh, now that I'm thinking about it, they vaccinated medical professionals in the first group as well. But school teachers, police etc. don't get a priority, a decision that meets with a lot of criticism\nteacher: Silence and quiet (as a noun) are very close, but silence is about the act of not uttering a sound while quiet is about the enjoyable perception of the lack of loud noises\nteacher: If it makes any sense\nstudent: It does..I had never appreciated the difference, thank you for the description!\nstudent: So it would be 'I remained silent/in silence' vs 'The house is quiet'\nteacher: I just feel it would be more 'English' to say, ah, some peace and quiet at last! (kids are in bed or something like that)\nteacher: Yes, exactly!\nteacher: Your examples are spot-on\nstudent: That was just a simple example...but thank you!\nteacher: Great, shall we go to the last exercise in the Use of English part of the test? And then I've prepared a bit of linguistic deliciousness for you :)\nstudent: Yes! Let me find the file\nteacher: Please, it's page 6 in the pdf\nstudent: Part 4, found it!\nteacher: Lovely! Key word tranformation, probably the trickiest 'use of English' task.\nteacher: which is reflected in the fact that each sentence gets two points, not one, like in the previous tasks\nteacher: I mean when it's being marked\nstudent: I see...let's try\nstudent: 25. no telling\nstudent: 25. no telling how long\nteacher: You can use 3-8 words for the gap, and the challenge is to keep the meaning as close to the original as possible\nstudent: nope...I have to think a bit longer for these indeed...\nstudent: 25. no telling how long it\nteacher: Yes, correct! the last option\nstudent: 26. is little demand for\nteacher: yes, good!\nstudent: 27. impressed by how good great a (I am not 100% sure about the preprositions 'by' here)\nstudent: 28. resignation came as a surprise to\nstudent: (29 later)\nstudent: 30. the height of his power\nteacher: Hold on, 27. The preposition is good! Also with / at are possible. But 'good' doesn't quite convey the meaning, the answer is 'skilled' or 'skillful'\nstudent: Interesting...actually I also work on the problem of paraphrase\nteacher: 28 = correct\nstudent: and replacing 'skill' with 'good' is the sort of mistake I expect from my models...I should have read the sentence twice! Thank you for pointing it out\nstudent: 29. was not a tree whatsoever in\nstudent: I am really not sure about 29, I am wondering if I should keep the word 'vegetation'\nteacher: Yes, this task is different from others, in that paraphrasing is actually discouraged\nteacher: Exactly, good idea!\nteacher: there was no vegetation whatsoever in/ there was nothing whatsoever growing in\nteacher: because there could have been a bush / flower, not necessarily a tree\nteacher: And the same issue in 30. How would you change your answer to keep the meaning as close to the original as possible?\nstudent: I see...I was thinking that 'a tree whatsoever' would convey the meaning of 'a tree or anything similar'...but maybe my understanding of the word whatsoever isn't correct.\nstudent: At the height of his success,\nstudent: Where I am not sure how you spell 'success'...anyway\nteacher: Oh no, whatsoever just means 'absolutely none', it's a way of amplifying 'no'. He has no money/ friends whatsoever.\nteacher: Yes, at the height of his success!\nstudent: OKay :) it was difficult indeed...and, at least from this first attempt, I'd say keeping the meaning 'as close as possible' is part of the problem.\nstudent: is the most difficult part of the problem.\nteacher: Oh, exactly, and you got all the expressions they are looking for right, I think\nteacher: It's about learning the logic of the task\nteacher: In writing and speaking, the situation is reverse. You are expected to paraphrase, especially at this level of proficiency\nteacher: For example, if the examiner asks you, 'Do you prefer to spend time on your own or with friends?' in a speaking test,\nstudent: Which means I should definitely prepare for the exam, it shouldn't be too difficult.\nteacher: it would be a bit of a waste of opportunity to start saying, 'I prefer to spend my time with friends...' because you've just repeated the question and haven't shown off your English\nteacher: When you could have said, 'I'm quite gregarious, and I'm most in my element among people'\nstudent: I see...\nteacher: But in key word transformation, only the necessary paraphrasing!\nstudent: Okay! It is so difficult for me to talk about my free time\nstudent: I mean, in the current situation...\nteacher: Haha, yes, I can imagine! It's just an example\nstudent: I enjoy both company and solitude, even though I would normally tend towards the latter. I enjoy studying and learning.\nstudent: But now I have children and I am under a light lockdown, so I am always with my children...\nteacher: But again, the skill for the speaking task is to talk at length in a way that shows off your language on any topic. The good news is, you don't ever have to be truthful, just whatever gives your English a chance to shine!\nteacher: For example, I wouldn't really describe myself as gregarious, but it was the first C2 word that came to my mind, and I went with it\nstudent: Haha, I know...this reminds me of Hugh Laurie, when he auditioned for Dr House he lied about where he was staying, because he felt like 'Chicago' was too difficult to say with an American accent (I believe it was Chicago)\nstudent: I see...well, if Latin words are a plus, it shouldn't be difficult for me...\nteacher: Oh really? Love it! (and love Hugh Laurie, one of my favourite actors)\nstudent: Yes...it was one of his interviews, but finding it now would be like looking for a needle in a haystack\nteacher: Ah, speaking of words!\nteacher: the promised linguistic treat\nteacher: Have you ever heard of Tom Swift books / jokes?\nteacher: Yes, a needle in a haystack, true!\nstudent: no I haven't heard of him...\nteacher: I've never read the books, but they are apparently sci-fi for teenagers or something like that\nteacher: But! they gave birth to a whole series of jokes that mimick the style of the book\nteacher: The jokes are based on puns (do you know this one?)\nstudent: No, I don't know it sorry...\nteacher: a play on the fact that a particular word has more than one meaning\nteacher: I'll give you an example\nteacher: What's black and white and red (= read) all over? - a newspaper\nstudent: Oh, now I see! Sorry...\nteacher: This is a pun based on the fact that 'red' and 'read' have the same pronunciation\nstudent: I thought you were asking about the series of jokes, I assumed this was also published as a book or something...\nstudent: Okay, I actually knew that a 'pun' was some sort of a joke, but I didn't know it involved the meaning of the word in particular.\nteacher: Oh sorry, I confused you! No, I was just trying to say that 'Tom said' jokes are based on some wordplay\nteacher: Ok, let's have a look at a couple of jokes, I wonder if you know both meaning of words...\nstudent: Okay!\nteacher: \u2022 'I'd like to stop by the mausoleum,' Tom said cryptically.\nteacher: Here, the play is on the fact that a crypt is a burial place, like a mausoleum, but cryptically means 'with an air of mystery'\nteacher: Does it make sense?\nstudent: haha...okay, cryptically refers both to the manner of speaking, as if hiding something, and refers to crypts? The old cemetery\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Yes!! I needn't have explained it to you :)\nteacher: another one\nteacher: \u2022 'Pass me the shellfish,' said Tom crabbily.\nstudent: Hmm...this time you need to explain to me...or better, I am pretty sure that crabbily refers also to crabs\nstudent: but I don't know the other meaning of the word\nteacher: Well, yes, it comes from 'crab', but it means grumpy and bad-tempered!\nstudent: I see\nteacher: Good non-Latin word)) The boss is well crabby today or something like that\nstudent: Haha...okay, I will remember this one!\nteacher: Ok, one last!\nteacher: Aaand the chatroom decided to crash!\nstudent: I see\nstudent: indeed that's the case\nteacher: Ah, I'll have to let you go. Would you like to do the reading tasks in the same pdf?\nteacher: If you have the time\nteacher: I mean as homework\nstudent: Okay, I will try to do them!\nstudent: Yes, now I have a call\nteacher: Great! Ok, sorry, talk to you next week!\nstudent: Yes, thank you! Have a nice day!",
    "student: Sorry, it's my name as usual )\nstudent: Hi\nstudent: )\nteacher: Hi Megan Smith!\nteacher: It's ok :)\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: Fine, but quite (razbitaya) )\nteacher: Oh, are you feeling exhausted? Sorry to hear that!\nstudent: I don't know if it's the weather changes or I just have to sleep more at night )\nstudent: How are you? )\nteacher: The beginning of spring is never easy in my experience, we have so little energy left!\nteacher: I'm quite tired too, actually, and fed up with the lockdown. I don't even bake anymore!\nstudent: I mean I'm OK, but I don't feel 100%\nteacher: You know 'fed up with'?\nstudent: I see! It's so hard to be at home all the time and try to work when all the family is there\nstudent: Yes! I know 'fed up', like I'm full of it )\nteacher: Yes, like 'I've had enough of it'\nteacher: Yes, indeed! And we can't even go anywhere in our lovely car until March 29\nstudent: Oh, no!\nteacher: I noticed I seem to be starting every lesson with complaints about the lockdown... I'll try to be more positive in the future!\nstudent: I'm sorry about it\nstudent: haha\nteacher: Thank you))\nstudent: I'm ready to be your therapist during the lesson ))\nteacher: How's your new marketing campaign? I noticed Sophia Chen comment in some Russian-learning group with some ALMA tips\nstudent: At least you complain in perfect English )))\nteacher: Aww, thank you, I appreciate it!\nteacher: Not always))\nstudent: Ok, we decided just to try posting on Facebook and we will see if it works\nstudent: we are not sure 100%\nteacher: Yes, it's hard to know for sure, but it sounds like a good place to start\nstudent: And at the same time we will have a 2,5-months marketing course and we will change our strategy I think\nteacher: Ok, I see! with the lovemark lady? or with 'papa'?\nstudent: also we are preparing several forms for the existing students and the students who gave up Russian or Ukrainian\nstudent: We will analyze the data and then change our strategy too\nstudent: The house with the lady )\nteacher: Ok, sure. Do you mean feedback forms?\nstudent: And now I'm watching the 'papa course' too )\nstudent: papa course' too )\nstudent: Exactly! Feedback forms )\nteacher: I see! You're properly getting your teeth into it, I'm sure it'll pay off!\nstudent: Ok, 'rasshifruy')))\nstudent: Ah, Ok! I see\nstudent: But all these expressions are new to me )\nteacher: Yes, I thought you'd understand even if you don't know every word )) which is a very useful skill\nteacher: What do you think it means to get your teeth into something?\nstudent: Like to decide to work intensively with this stuff )\nteacher: Yes, exactly!\nteacher: and pay off? Like, I'm sure your efforts will pay off!\nstudent: Yes!\nteacher: Yes, it's quite intuitive :)\nstudent: It means that if I pay attention to this topic, I will have good results later\nteacher: Yes, that's right!\nteacher: e.g. All the running he was doing paid off when he took part in a marathon\nteacher: The marketing campaign started to pay off\nteacher: things like that\nstudent: I see!\nstudent: thank you\nteacher: Ok, but you wanted to focus on the 'old' words, didn't you?\nteacher: Thanks for your list, you're a very hard-working student!\nstudent: haha, I'm not sure )\nteacher: Oh, what's the weather like in Kyiv? Is it still snowy or has it now turned into .....?\nstudent: ok\nstudent: it has now turned into slush\nstudent: slush\nstudent: sorry\nteacher: Haha, I like the first spelling)))\nstudent: hahaha )\nteacher: That's right! Do you know 'slush' the drink? people also say 'slushy'\nteacher: Lots of crushed ice and a sweet drink (horrible stuff)\nstudent: No, I don't )\nteacher: Or, if you're a grown-up, lots of crushed ice, some grapefruit juice (for example) and a shot of vodka\nteacher: That's ok, you're not missing out!\nstudent: It looks like a Margarita cocktail\nteacher: Hmmm, I suppose that crushed ice on top of a Margarita is a bit like slush, yes!\nstudent: Doesn't it?\nstudent: actually I'm not a cocktail person )\nstudent: I'm not a guru ))\nteacher: Here in the UK it's a kid's drink, actually, there are lots of slushy machines\nteacher: Maybe I should make some flavoured ice for slushies in the summer... Hmmm\nstudent: flavoured ice?\nteacher: Yes, if you freeze some juice for example, or maybe some strawberry puree or some watermelon\nteacher: Ah, this made me think of summer!\nstudent: haha\nstudent: Actually summer is not my favorite season ) it's too hot here\nteacher: Ooh, I live for summer! Mind you, it doesn't get too hot in England (for me). It might be 30+ for a few days (called a 'heatwave' here), but that's it\nteacher: What's your favourite season?\nstudent: Maybe spring and autumn\nstudent: I mean the first half of autumn )\nteacher: Haha, yes, I imagine! It's summer for me, with all the fruit and berries.\nstudent: Because usually the second one looks like winter here )\nteacher: Yes, pretty much!\nstudent: I like the weather. Not too cold and not too hot )\nstudent: But I like the fruit, vegetables and berries in the summer as you do )\nteacher: And Kyiv is beautiful both in the spring and in the autumn!\nteacher: Ok, here are some words from your list!\nteacher: Branch out Staff Upside / downside Quaint To browse Affordable / unaffordable Get rid of\nteacher: Do you remember them all?\nteacher: Sorry, there should be commas between them\nstudent: hm\nteacher: branch out, staff, upside, downside, quaint, to browse, affordable / unaffordable, to get rid of\nstudent: are they from my list?? )\nteacher: Yes :))\nstudent: Ah\nstudent: yes!\nteacher: Ok, which one means something positive about a situation?\nstudent: now I remember )\nstudent: upside? 0\nteacher: Yes!\nteacher: What about 'to add a new service to your business'?\nstudent: branch out )\nteacher: Yes, brAnch out\nstudent: yes!!\nteacher: What about 'throw away / not have something you don't want'?\nstudent: to get rid of?\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: Can you give me a definition for one of them, please? And I'll guess the word!\nstudent: ok\nstudent: People who work in the company )\nteacher: staff!\nteacher: Cool! another one?\nstudent: Ok\nstudent: if you can have the thing. the thing is ______ for you )\nteacher: affordable?\nstudent: yes!\nteacher: Yes! if you have enought money to buy it\nstudent: aha!\nteacher: Which one means 'strange and old-fashioned'?\nstudent: quaint\nteacher: Yaay, well done!\nteacher: And if we browse at a shop / browse through a magazine, it means?\nstudent: )\nstudent: just browse?\nteacher: It means you're looking at different things, maybe without buying anything\nteacher: And browse through a book / magazine = go through it quickly, without reading properly\nteacher: Oh, and of course we browse the Internet\nstudent: I see now. It was about the definition )\nteacher: much more often than browse in a shop / through a book))\nteacher: Yes, sorry, I confused you a bit!\nteacher: Ok, let's play a game! I will ask you a question using one of the words, and you reply using another one, ok?\nteacher: branch out, staff, upside, downside, quaint, to browse, affordable / unaffordable, to get rid of\nteacher: Here are the words again\nteacher: Did you get rid of a lot of stuff when you were moving to your new flat?\nstudent: ok\nstudent: I think we didn't throw away lots of stuff\nteacher: Ok, can you try to use another one of our words to answer? For example, yes, we got rid of some old clothes, that's an upside to moving to a new place! or something like that\nstudent: Ah!\nstudent: Ok, I see now\nstudent: We paid a lot to decorate our new flat so it wasn't affordable to buy a new stuff as well, so we did't get rid of a lot\nteacher: Lovely, makes sense!\nstudent: * so it wasn't affordable\nteacher: Could you ask me something, using one of the words?\nstudent: ok )\nstudent: What are the downsides of lockdown?\nstudent: sorry\nstudent: ))\nstudent: But I feel you need to complain )\nteacher: Haha, ok!\nteacher: Not being able to have a proper haircut! I love going to hairdresser's, just sitting their waiting for my turn, browsing through some magazines\nstudent: Ah! I see!\nteacher: Ok, I think we've got time for one more\nteacher: Do you think ALMA might branch out one day?\nstudent: did you manage it? I remember that you have decided to do it yourself?\nteacher: No, the solution so far is a ponytail! but I hate it\nstudent: I'm not sure ALMA might branch out one day, maybe we just have to become bigger and concentrate on online education, because I think it's our upside\nstudent: is it right?\nstudent: like 'silnaya storona'?\nteacher: Hmm, it's more of an advantage of a situation\nteacher: you mean it's ALMA's strength\nteacher: Ok, I've got to let you go now! Great work today, thank you!\nteacher: I'll message you about the time for the next week, ok?\nstudent: OK! see you! Thank you!\nteacher: My pleasure :) Bye!",
    "student: Hi Ms. Rachel Thompson!\nstudent: How are you?\nteacher: Hi Emily!\nteacher: I'm good, thank you! Working in peace and quiet, and none of the careful dance of who gets to work while the other's looking after our son with my husband :)\nteacher: So a marked improvement\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: Haha, good thank you :) I am also working in peace and quiet: the children are finally with the childminder.\nstudent: And maybe I will even go back to the office this week! For one day...but that is also something I am looking forward to.\nteacher: Yaaay! :) The constant duality of parenthood: loving the kids to bits but being glad of a quiet moment\nstudent: Indeed, but I believe that the current measures do make this duality more apparent...\nteacher: We're now looking forward to the next stage of lockdown easing (March 29) when we should be allowed to go on day trips and see people outdoors. However, the PM has cautioned people that the schedule might be changed because schools will drive the infection rate up\nteacher: Yes, it's not been easy in the last 12 months!\nstudent: Yes, especially for someone living in a foreign country...\nstudent: At least some of my friends could be helped by their parents, while we don't know when we will be able to go back to Italy for a visit...it probably won't be possible at Easter...\nteacher: I guess that Easter barbecue with your family you'd been looking forward to might not happen now?\nteacher: I see, I'm so sorry to hear that! We're the same here, not allowed to go see my in-laws at Easter either\nteacher: at Easter, by the way. Like at Christmas\nteacher: But if there's a word 'day', then the preposition is 'on'. On Christmas Day, on Good Friday (FriDAY)\nstudent: Oh..I didn't know that...okay...\nstudent: On Christmas Day we couldn't visit our families, so we were really looking forward to doing it at Easter...\nteacher: Do you know when you might be able to travel? In the summer?\nstudent: Yes, to be honest I hope for May: good weather and vaccines should make it possible without passing almost a month in quarantine (that's the main problem, currently...and maybe we would do it, if we didn't have children)\nteacher: we would do it, if we ___ ____ children\nteacher: Yes, fingers crossed for May for you! And for us as well, May 17 is what the government said, unless they change it. They said they are guided by data, not dates...\nstudent: if we didn't have children?\nteacher: Yes! And there's another way to correct it\nstudent: if we had no children\nteacher: if we didn't have children / if we hadn't ___ children\nstudent: hmm...if we hadn't had children...\nteacher: hadn't got, as the past form of of 'we've got children'\nteacher: mind you, I think\nteacher: sorry, I think 'if we didn't have children' sounds much better\nstudent: Okay...that's why it didn't come to my mind: the 'got' isn't used a lot in the American series I usually watch\nteacher: Yes, it's much more British!\nteacher: Oh, have you had the time to do some of the reading tasks?\nstudent: Oh my...I am sorry, I totally forgot about that...last week was a bit tough with the children always at home...\nteacher: No worries! You know what, let's continue with some vocabulary work and maybe you'll have time this week\nteacher: But it's ok if you don't! I didn't realize your kids were at home all week last week\nteacher: And by vocabulary work, I mean unpacking 'Tom said' joked :)\nstudent: Okay! Last week the childminder's daugher was in quarantine so we couldn't let the children go...\nstudent: but this week it is fine (so far), so I will have time for those exercises :) Let's see what Tom said\nteacher: Aah, I see!\nteacher: Lovely! Do you remember the word from last time? meaning 'grumpy and irritated' and sounding like a type of shellfish\nstudent: crabby\nteacher: Yes :)\nstudent: Hearing screams 24/7 makes me crabby\nstudent: Which is exactly what happens with the children are always at home...\nteacher: Haha, yes, I can imagine! Are your boys not sleeping through the night yet? I guess they aren't, they are very young!\nstudent: Well, usually they wake up only one or two times...but this is still a lot as it means I have to get up at least two to four times per night...\nteacher: Oh yes, one or two times each. Exhausting!\nstudent: Indeed ;) anyway, what did Tom say?\nteacher: I'd like my money back, and then some,' said Tom with interest.\nteacher: Just let me know if it's funny and what two meanings of 'interest' are we looking at here :)\nstudent: This is funny, yes :) interest, meaning both interest on a capital and interest as in interested into the answer\nteacher: Yes! exactly\nstudent: The use of 'and then some' here is just like a shorthand for 'and then some more', right?\nteacher: Yes, it's quite common actually, let me think of an example\nteacher: In informal speaking, it means 'much more'\nteacher: He made good money out of his new book, and then some.\nteacher: He ate a huge portion of pasta and then some\nstudent: I see...this is one of those expressions that I have only heard, but never really studied...\nteacher: Yes, a really natural everyday expression\nstudent: Saying: 'I had just a beer, and then some...'...could be a funny way to say I drank a lot\nstudent: right?\nteacher: Now, our next word is quite bookish, in contrast\nteacher: Yes, like, last night I had a few beers and then some - would imply quite a lot of beer!\nteacher: Ok, next one!\nteacher: If you want me, I shall be in the attic,' Tom said, loftily\nstudent: I don't fully understand this one...I am unsure, I think that 'a loft' is another word for attic\nstudent: *another word\nstudent: but I have no clue as to the other meaning\nteacher: Yes, correct!\nteacher: If a person's attitude is lofty, it's arrogant. Like the person thinks they are better than others\nstudent: Oh, I see...I would have never guessed it had this meaning\nteacher: a lofty attitude, lofty tone\nteacher: It's the same idea of being high up, like a loft, higher than others in this case\nteacher: But also, a lofty idea / mission is of a high moral standard\nteacher: A lofty mission of fighting ineqality in the world\nteacher: That's a positive meaning\nstudent: As a child I always had good marks with little studying, which made my attitude rather lofty towards other students.\nstudent: that's a negative meaning...hmmm...\nteacher: Yes, absolutely correct!\nstudent: I see, 'A lofty mission of fighting inequality' refers more to the 'high ideals' of the mission, right?\nstudent: sorry\nteacher: Yes, exactly, the high ideals! again, 'high' being an important part of the meaning\nstudent: I now saw your description of that second meaning...okay, thanks :)\nstudent: *I just saw\nteacher: A common collocation is 'a lofty goal'\nstudent: I gues 'I now saw' would be incorrect, right?\nteacher: I set myself a lofty goal of never yelling at my child (at failed miserably)\nteacher: I now saw is incorrect, how can you fix it?\nteacher: *and, not at\nstudent: I now see\nstudent: I guess that would be my proposed correction\nteacher: Yes, possible. I've now seen would be more natural\nstudent: I see...a fluency edit, as I would call it on my job\nstudent: (Meaning 'I've now seen' feels more fluent than 'I now see')\nteacher: or I've just seen... Mind you, in American English it's 'I just saw', it might be more familiar to you\nteacher: Ok, that makes sense! You can say things like 'I thought X was a true friend, but I now see that he isn't' or something like that\nteacher: but for something that's happened just now, I would go for present perfect, I've just seen\nteacher: There's even a Beatles song, 'I've just seen a face...' :)\nstudent: Oh, I don't know it...I will have to listen to it then!\nteacher: The early Beatles, super cheerful :)\nteacher: Ok, I think we've got time for one more!\nteacher: I forgot what I needed at the store,' Tom said listlessly.\nstudent: Haha, this is funny! To be honest 'listlessly' is a new word for me...but I am pretty sure it means 'without a list' and then I could only guess the other meaning...\nteacher: Haha, yes, they are playing on 'without a (shopping) list' here, but listless actually means 'having no energy and enthusiasm and unwilling to do anything needing effort'\nteacher: He's seemed listless and a little depressed ever since he got his exam results.\nteacher: this is from Cambridge English Dictionary (online), which I always recommend to my students :)\nstudent: I see...I should start using it...I usually just google the terms, and therefore use a different dictionary every time\nteacher: Oh, I really recommend it, they have recordings of both British and American pronunciation, good definitions and good examples!\nteacher: And also, a lot of words have a CEFR label. For example, if you're preparing for CPE writing / speaking, you are interested in C2 words\nstudent: There are lists of words which should be learned? Wow, I didn't know about this!\nteacher: No, not lists as far as I know, but some of the words are marked C2, for example\nteacher: For example, check out the word 'relish' if you have a moment after class\nstudent: okay, I will do it!\nteacher: Ok, I've got to let you go! And we'll be back to the lofty goal of perfecting English at the same time next week, right?\nstudent: Yes!\nteacher: You've got your reading pdf, if you have time for it\nstudent: Thank you! See you next week...and have a nice day!!\nteacher: Have a lovely week, bye!",
    "student: Hi, Mr. Thompson!\nstudent: How is life?\nteacher: Hiya! All good, thank you!\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: I'm ok, thank you! )\nstudent: Is Jacob at school now? )\nteacher: Have you had a nice yoga session?\nteacher: Yes, he is! We can now work in peace and quiet! But I do miss him...\nstudent: Today I haven't had it. Usually I have pilates on Monday and yoga on Friday\nteacher: What about Wednesday?\nstudent: And sometimes I have strength training on Wednesday\nstudent: But today I've missed it )\nstudent: I see. I miss Liam all the time\nteacher: Oh I see! Fair enough\nstudent: Today I have had a face massage\nstudent: I try to do it every week and I can see the result\nteacher: It's difficult, isn't it? On the one hand, you want some time to get some work done; on the other hand, you miss your little one\nstudent: It pays off for me )\nteacher: It pays off for you! Yes!\nstudent: Agree, it's difficult, but we still need time for ourselves\nstudent: Ah! It pays off for me )\nstudent: And even more about children. I feel like I become a crazy mom when I spend all the time with Liam\nstudent: I don't like feeling like that\nstudent: So I think it's vital for me to work and to do something just for me\nteacher: Yes, you can, of course, say, pay someone. I paid a massage therapist for a massage, for example\nteacher: But efforts / regular face massages pay off\nteacher: or pay off for me\nstudent: I see\nstudent: thank you!\nteacher: Yes, it's so important! Vital is a very good word here :)\nstudent: thank you ))\nteacher: Well, well, do you know what the UK has been buzzing about in the last couple of weeks?\nstudent: Oh!\nstudent: Yes of course!\nstudent: I would like to ask you what you think about the situation\nstudent: would\nteacher: Oh do you? You're very well informed :)\nteacher: You mean the Meghan and Harry situation?\nstudent: Do you mean the interview with Meghan and Harry?\nstudent: Yes )\nteacher: Yes, sure) Have you seen it? I haven't, it's not on youtube yet (and I'm not sure I want to spend 2 hours on it)\nstudent: Actually I think it's not just about the UK. I think that all the world is watching (on?) this story\nstudent: No, I haven't watched it\nteacher: Neither have I\nstudent: And actually I'm not sure that I have enough patience to watch\nteacher: Me neither!\nstudent: Yeeees! ))\nstudent: Ok! So Neither have I )\nteacher: that's right :))\nstudent: I'm also not sure that I really want to watch it )\nteacher: Well, they say the UK is split into two. Older people are sorry for the Queen and 'senior royals' and younger people are sorry for Harry and Meghan\nstudent: I'm not sure that I have my own opinion here\nstudent: )\nteacher: But I'm not terribly surprised. The royals are not the easiest family to marry into, especially for someone who is used to being an independent woman like Meghan was\nteacher: Yes, it's hard to say, isn't it!\nteacher: I'm actually much more shocked by something else\nstudent: I'm sorry for Meghan if she feels so bad about the story, but I don't know if she is (truthful)?\nteacher: Yes, you can say if she is truthful / honest / if she is telling the truth\nstudent: so I don't know what the right position here is)\nteacher: Remember we were talking about how bills go through parliament and become laws? a while ago?\nstudent: You've written that you are much more shocked by something else ? What is it?\nteacher: Yes, I'm getting there :)\nstudent: Of course, I remember\nteacher: And then the Queen approves the law (it's called the royal assent). In theory, she has veto powers but she never uses it, it's a formality\nstudent: What does 'I'm getting there' mean? )\nteacher: I'm getting to the point of telling you what I'm shocked about))\nstudent: Ok )\nstudent: Yes I remember about the Queen's veto\nteacher: Well, it turns out, the Queen has much more power than we ever knew! Apparently, she looks at bills before they go to the Parliament and she has changed / thrown away some of them, especially the ones that are not good for her. For example, if a bill means people will find out about how rich she is or there is a danger that she will lose some of her land / powers\nteacher: She vetoes some bills before they even get to the Parliament!\nstudent: Really?\nteacher: This was a new investigation, and this practice is completely undemocratic, of course, and means that the Queen has much more power than anybody thought\nteacher: Yes, the investigation was done by one of the leading newspapers, the Guardian\nstudent: Yes, people think that she is just 'milaya starushka' )))\nteacher: She apparently looked through more than 1000 bills before they got to the Parliament\nteacher: Exactly! But she is a very powerful woman, protecting her wealth and her power\nstudent: during which period?\nteacher: I should have said 'has looked', during her rule\nteacher: She has looked through more than 1000 bills since she became the Queen\nteacher: That's good grammar now :)\nstudent: ))\nteacher: How shocking is that?!\nstudent: Shocking shocking!\nstudent: she is not milaya starushka\nteacher: Exactly! :)\nteacher: Not at all!\nteacher: Ok, but have you seen the interview that Prince Harry gave to James Corden, a couple of weeks ago?\nstudent: was that investigation published on the Guardian website?\nstudent: Or there is a video?\nteacher: James Corden is an actor, musician and TV presenter from the UK, but he moved to Los Angeles a while ago\nteacher: It's a series of articles, I'll send you links if you're curious\nteacher: On the Guardian website, yes!\nstudent: No, I haven't seen it\nstudent: What is it about?\nteacher: Ah, good! Because this is going to be your homework. This is the most fun royal interview I've ever seen! I'm sure you'll enjoy it\nteacher: And I'm going to give you some vocabulary for it in a minute\nteacher: When Harry and Meghan stepped down as royals, they moved to Canada, and then they moved to LA\nstudent: Ok! )\nteacher: I don't want to spoil it for you!\nstudent: I see )\nteacher: Ok, are you ready for some new words? Maybe not all of them new)\nstudent: I'm ready! )\nteacher: Ok, the first one is 'fare': a bus fare, a train fare (the money you pay to ride on public transport)\nteacher: When I first moved to Kyiv, a bus fare was about 2 hryvnas, and when I was leaving, it was about 5 :)\nstudent: )\nteacher: What's the underground fare these days?\nstudent: I think the underground fare is 8 uah now\nteacher: Oh my goodness! I think it used to be 1 uah\nteacher: But still, it's much cheaper than London transport fares :)\nstudent: I'n not sure because now I don't have to use the metro and I try to avoid it because it's crowded\nteacher: I can imagine!\nteacher: Ok, next one!\nstudent: It's cheaper you are right )\nteacher: If you imagine a crown (like the one the Queen wears), it's very heavy because it's made of metal and is decorated with.....\nteacher: shiny beautiful very expensive stones\nteacher: called 'gems'\nteacher: /d\u0292em/\nstudent: Aha! I see\nteacher: Ok, and if you're a tourist in London, you can go to some famous places, like Trafalgar Square, Hyde Park etc. etc., but also, you can find some less famous and less crowded places that are still very interesting\nteacher: Places like these are called 'hidden gems'\nteacher: They are very interesting, but not many people know about them!\nstudent: Ok! A very good explanation actually\nstudent: good\nteacher: Ok, cool, I'm going to be moving on quite fast, so that we have the time for all the words. Next one!\nteacher: an obstacle course\nteacher: it's a race in which runners have to climb over things, jump, hit a target etc. etc.\nteacher: not just run\nstudent: I see\nteacher: maybe the best way is to google a picture of an obstacle course\nteacher: But you can imagine it, right? There are obstacle courses for dogs too, for example, not just for people\nstudent: It's understandable 100%\nstudent: )\nteacher: Ok, next one! As you know, Harry is a prince, but his official title is the Duke of Sussex\nteacher: and Meghan is....?? (the female version of duke)\nteacher: the duchess\nteacher: the Duchess of Sussex\nstudent: I see\nteacher: By the way, Harry calls her 'Meg' in the interview (just to help with understanding when you're listening). And their little son is Archie\nteacher: Not a very common royal name at all :)\nstudent: hahaha\nstudent: How old is he actually?\nstudent: 1 year old?\nteacher: 1,5 I think\nstudent: 1.0\nteacher: Yes, something like that\nstudent: Aha, thank you\nteacher: Ok, next one!\nteacher: If someone find the love of their life, this person is 'the one' for them\nteacher: James Corden asks Harry, 'When did you realize that Meghan was the one?'\nstudent: aha, ok )))\nteacher: the one' as in 'the one and only', 'the best one'\nteacher: Yes, it's quite intuitive\nteacher: Ok, and if two people meet and like each other straightaway, we can say that they 'hit it off'\nteacher: It's not necessarily about a romantic relationship. I think you and me hit it off when we first met 8 (??) years ago :)\nteacher: At least I knew I liked you straightaway\nstudent: is it just about love?\nteacher: No, not only!\nstudent: Ah, Ok. I see now\nstudent: )\nteacher: Ok, next one!\nstudent: We completely hit it off ))\nteacher: Today is the new word attack, we will practice and chat more on Friday, ok?\nteacher: Yes, we did))\nstudent: ok )\nstudent: I'm ready )\nteacher: Ok! Do you know 'fiction'? and 'fictional'?\nstudent: Like a genre?\nteacher: Like books / films. If a book is fiction, it's written about imaginary characters and situations\nstudent: Yes, I know )\nteacher: But if it's non-fiction, it's about history, science etc. What actually happened / what is actually true\nteacher: Ok, cool!\nstudent: I see\nteacher: And also, a book / film can be based on a true story\nteacher: or maybe 'loosely based on' a true story\nstudent: Boris prefers to write non-fiction books )\nstudent: Boris\nteacher: It's not very accurate, but it's loosely based on the truth\nteacher: Yes, the Churchill book is non-fiction I guess. If he tried to be accurate about history\nstudent: ok, so loosely based it's like based on the truth but not 100%\nstudent: I see\nteacher: yes, it's maybe 70% :)\nstudent: haha ) Ok ))\nteacher: Ok, in the interview Harry talks about 'public service'. The life of a royal is given to public service. Public service means things that are done for the people of the country, such as hospitals, libraries, schools, charities etc.\nteacher: Trying to improve the life of people\nteacher: without making money out of it\nstudent: I see\nteacher: Ok, an easy one\nteacher: hysterical = very funny\nstudent: ))\nstudent: not the same in Ukrainian or Russian )\nteacher: well, this is not always the meaning, but in the way Harry uses it\nteacher: No, not the same at all!\nteacher: It's so funny that you become hysterical and can't stop laughing. Something like that))\nteacher: Ok, one last word! a waffle!\nteacher: Do you know 'waffles'?\nstudent: The thing to eat? )\nteacher: /\u02c8w\u0252f.\u0259l/\nteacher: Yes, yummy waffles, like Belgian waffles\nstudent: Even more\nstudent: I like it\nstudent: it\nteacher: You can make them in a waffle maker, put some yogurt and berries on\nstudent: not just know )\nteacher: I love waffles :)\nteacher: Me too!\nstudent: So do I\nstudent: ?\nstudent: )\nteacher: Ok, cool! And you know 'casting', right? Choosing actors to play different roles in movies / shows\nstudent: I know!\nteacher: I think it's the same in Russian / Ukrainian, isn't it?\nteacher: Yes, cool, lovely!\nstudent: Same!\nteacher: Ok, I'm sending you the link. The only thing I'm going to say, the subtitles are not good quality at all (probably auto-generated), so I would strongly recommend to listen without them\nteacher: And also, if you re-read the new words before you listen, that should help\nstudent: ok )\nstudent: I will\nstudent: thank you!\nteacher: Oh, you know what, I'll send you the link in Messenger, that'll be easier.\nteacher: Ok, cool! And we can talk about it on Friday! Hope you enjoy it :)\nstudent: Have a good day xxx\nstudent: thank you\nstudent: bye )\nteacher: But if you haven't got the time to do it, just let me know, it's ok\nteacher: Bye! :)",
    "student: Hello Mrs. Rodriguez!\nteacher: Hi Taylor Smith!\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: I'm fine, a little sick but it's really fine.\nstudent: And you?\nteacher: Oh really? Hope you'll feel better soon!\nteacher: All good, thank you! We're having a horrible storm here\nstudent: Thanks! I hope so too. My stuffy nose really pisses me off\nstudent: ))\nstudent: Oh no, a storm? Strong winds?\nteacher: Ah! I hate sniffles!\nteacher: Yes, a really strong wind and episodes of torrential rain. Terrible horrible reall bad not-good-at-all kind of weather\nteacher: But we still seem to have Olivia's trampoline in the garden\nteacher: As in, it hasn't flown away\nteacher: yet\nstudent: Not a good day for Mary Poppins )))\nteacher: No! not at all :)))\nstudent: I've recently googled what kind of an umbrella she had\nteacher: Ok, shall we start with a bit of articles and then I promise something fun\nteacher: not that articles are not fun, but you know what I mean :)\nteacher: Oh yeah, what kind?\nstudent: And found it's prototype on Amazon worth 200-300 dollars\nstudent: haha\nstudent: deal!\nteacher: Ah, it won't be talking though\nteacher: Her umbrella talked, didn't it?\nstudent: She had a regular how would you say.. \u0442\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c\nteacher: a walking umbrella or a cane umbrella, apparently\nstudent: of dark blue color with a handle in the shape of a green parrot\nstudent: Yes, a cane umbrella! Thank you\nteacher: Yes! Very stylish\nstudent: I was looking for a present for my nanny\nteacher: for Sophia's nanny?\nteacher: Ooh, that would be a good present!\nstudent: Having found out the price, I went with a regular foldable non-Poppins-related one\nstudent: ))\nteacher: Yep, I can imagine :)\nteacher: Sorry, do you spell her name with a 'y'? Sophia?\nstudent: Yes. For Sophia's nanny for the 8th of March\nstudent: No worries\nteacher: I keep spelling it Serena -> Sarena, don't I? It's because I've got a friend whose daughter is called Serena -> Sarena\nstudent: When we chose the name, we knew that it'll be misspelled from time to time\nstudent: in Russian too\nteacher: Sorry about that!\nteacher: How do you spell it in Ukrainian?\nstudent: People write Sophia and Serena -> Sarena\nstudent: She's Sophia in her passport\nteacher: Right, I see! It makes sense\nstudent: And do you know how beautiful the Ukrainian transliteration system is?\nteacher: It's a very nice name, I really like it :)\nteacher: Tell me! I've not had a good experience with it\nstudent: They transliterated it into Serena -> Sarena\nteacher: Yeah, interesting...\nstudent: \u0415\u0443\u043a\u043a\u0448\u0438\u0434\u0443\nstudent: Terrible\nstudent: I hate the new (revised - so they say) system\nteacher: They were trying to transliterate my name as Ms. Johsnon\nstudent: Oh my\nstudent: My head is spinning\nteacher: And they were insisting that's what it would be because their computer said so\nstudent: I fought really bad for the 'G' in my surname\nstudent: They initially gave me Jaxon - Jayxen\nteacher: Yes! But your surname doesn't suddenly change just because they've got a new system. Ridiculous!\nstudent: which by no means represents how the surname should sound\nstudent: But we tricked the system then, me and James Smith\nteacher: I fought them too, successfully. The fights we could have really done without!\nstudent: I appealed and brought them an American visa with the right spelling and we attached a copy of a letter of invitation for a program (all made-up)\nstudent: an old American visa\nstudent: it had expired\nstudent: So we said that this program was going to commence soon and I'd travel and I needed my surname to be exactly like in my old visa\nteacher: Oh yes, I had to do a similar thing! I think I might have used my Cambridge exams certificates, by the way\nstudent: I'd travel *\nteacher: Haha, well done you!\nstudent: Nice thinking!\nstudent: This is the only way with them\nstudent: Thankfully, Sophia is not Jaxon - Jayxen\nstudent: because her parents aren't and it should be identical\nteacher: Haha, at least they had the sense to copy the parents' surname. They wouldn't copy my husband's! not without a lot of persuasion\nstudent: How could they!\nstudent: It's so stupid I can't even... rrrrghhhhhh\nteacher: Silly bureaucrats!\nstudent: Indeed\nstudent: Red tape is evil\nteacher: Ok, articles! :)) I know you can't wait\nstudent: Yes!\nstudent: The best topic of the English language\nstudent: yum!\nstudent: #ERROR!\nteacher: Oh, undoubtedly :)) but like I say, there is a reward at the end (not article-related)\nteacher: Ok, could you insert articles where necessary in these sentences?\nteacher: Actually, only the definite article\nteacher: definite / zero article\nteacher: Government is now insisting that mathematics is taught with methods reminiscent of 1950s.\nstudent: A reward mmmm OK\nstudent: Sounds exciting\nteacher: Yes, yes!\nstudent: The gov-t the methods the 50s\nteacher: the gov-t; the 50s\nteacher: but 'methods'\nteacher: I think an adjective (reminiscent) is not defining enough\nteacher: the methods that were used in the 50s\nstudent: reminiscent isn't the same as the 'of-phrase'\nteacher: the methods of the 50s\nteacher: No!\nstudent: I see. Not defining enough\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: I know, it's not easy! next one\nteacher: Government is only possible if majority accept law of land.\nstudent: (0) gov-t the majority the law of\nteacher: Yes! the law of the land, actually\nteacher: as in, the law of this land (this country)\nstudent: This land is youuuur land This land is myyy land\nteacher: Exactly))))\nteacher: When Julie walked into room, you could have cut atmosphere with a knife.\nstudent: the room, the atmo\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: Music of today deserves a different name from music of Beethoven, Back and other comparable geniuses.\nteacher: sorry! Bach, not Back :)))\nstudent: The music the music of\nteacher: Yes! grumpy old sentence :)\nteacher: People living inside Arctic Circle have a very different view of year from those living in, say, Belgium.\nstudent: BachBack is that animal that forecasts weather in Western Ukraine ))\nteacher: Really?

That one\nteacher: the Arctic, the year - yes, but 0 people\nteacher: People living inside the Arctic Circle (in general)\nstudent: Right\nteacher: again, not defining enough!\nteacher: Many people in public sector of work are just looking for sun, sand and relaxation when they go on holiday, and why not?\nstudent: the public sector, the sun\nteacher: the public sector - yes, but it's actually 'sun'. Because the meaning is 'sunshine' rather than, you know, the sun itself\nteacher: the centre of our solar system))\nstudent: Didn't know that rule about sun=sunshine\nstudent: Ok!\nteacher: Hold on a sec, I think the book says something about it\nteacher: Ah, no, I couldn't find anything\nstudent: That's fine\nteacher: But the logic is, if you're looking for the sun, just wait until the morning and look up\nstudent: I'll remember it from your words\nteacher: But if you're looking for some sun, you might have to travel outside the UK :)\nstudent: ahahahah\nstudent: so funny\nteacher: It definitely feels like it at the moment :))\nstudent: I'll remember it for sure now\nstudent: Right.. with the storm\nteacher: But I'm being unfair, British summer can be glorious\nstudent: We all need to move to Tenerife)\nteacher: sometimes, several days a year\nteacher: Ooooh, yes yes yes. +25 all year round\nstudent: perfetto\nstudent: or better still perfecto\nteacher: Ok, well done for persevering through the articles! the promised reward\nstudent: Yes!

Tom sad 'adverb'\nteacher: The adverb has a double meaning\nteacher: You will see in a moment\nteacher: \u2022 'I'd like to stop by the mausoleum,' Tom said cryptically.\nstudent: haha\nteacher: Yes, you've got it. cryptic as in secretive and a crypt as in a burial place\nteacher: Ok, more jokes! And you tell me what the double meaning is, ok?\nstudent: Yes! A good one\nstudent: OK!\nteacher: \u2022 'Pass me the shellfish,' said Tom crabbily.\nstudent: One is a crab as a sea creature\nstudent: The other one -- dunno\nteacher: crabby = grumpy and irritated\nteacher: He was sleep-derpived and crabby\nstudent: Got it\nteacher: something like this\nteacher: Good colloquial word!\nteacher: Ok, next one!\nteacher: I forgot what I needed at the store,' Tom said listlessly.\nstudent: He was without a list\nteacher: yes :)))\nstudent: without energy\nteacher: Yaaay! correct\nstudent: googled I =)\nteacher: I'm going to add to the old example. He was sleep-deprived, crabby and listless :)\nteacher: Nice C2 word\nteacher: Ok, my favourite!\nteacher: \u2022 'I'd like my money back, and then some,' said Tom with interest.\nstudent: This makes me realise how my vocab sucks)))\nstudent: Ok this one I can figure out without googling\nteacher: Nooo, I picked the tricky ones, your vocab doesn't suck!\nstudent: interest as %\nteacher: Yes, I find it so funny)))\nteacher: Have you got time for one more?\nstudent: and interest as a desire to explore\nstudent: something like that\nteacher: Yes, definitely!\nstudent: yes, I've got time\nstudent: shoot\nteacher: \u2022 'I'm throwing this soup on the ground!' said Tom with wanton disregard.\nstudent: hmmm\nstudent: a tough one\nstudent: disregard as in something connected with trash\nteacher: You know wonton soup? As in Chinese soup with dumplings\nstudent: Yes!\nteacher: Yes, and 'wanton disregard' is a legal term for reckless thoughtless behaviour\nteacher: something like 'khalatnost' I think\nstudent: haha\nteacher: Yes, I know, it's a good one :))\nstudent: It is\nteacher: Yes, so we've got crabby, listless, and wanton disregard\nteacher: thanks to Tom :)\nstudent: Thank you Tom!\nstudent: And thank you Mrs. Rodriguez\nteacher: Ok, shall we try Monday at 3 pm next week?\nteacher: It's my pleasure :)\nstudent: Let's try!\nteacher: Lovely!

Sorry about that!\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: It's ok, don't worry\nstudent: I'm ok. I've had a yoga lesson\nstudent: It is snowing again in Kyiv (\nteacher: Was it nice?\nteacher: Oh really?\nteacher: Are getting a bit fed up with the winter?\nstudent: It was nice, thank you. I feel more relaxed after it and at the same time I feel stronger )\nstudent: oops\nstudent: stronger )\nstudent: I'm completely fed up with the winter! ))\nteacher: Yaay, I'm on my laptop now!\nstudent: Hi ))\nteacher: I can imagine!\nteacher: It's not nice here either. Cold and very windy!\nteacher: Sooo, how did you like the interview?\nstudent: it's windy here too\nstudent: I really liked it\nstudent: I was confused about the house\nstudent: Because I didn't know that sitcom about the prince )\nstudent: But I googled it )\nteacher: Oh, from the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air?\nstudent: Yes )\nteacher: Yes, it's an old American sitcom, you're absolutely right!\nteacher: with Will Smith I think\nstudent: I read about it in Wikipedia\nstudent: not THE Wiki?\nteacher: Yes, the Wikipedia, that's right :)\nstudent: Yes, you are right. With Will Smith\nstudent: The Wikipedia, but just Twitter or Facebook?\nstudent: Instagram, TikTok, Clubhouse? ))\nteacher: Let me check, I've started to doubt it\nteacher: Yes, I think it's just 'Wikipedia', sorry!\nteacher: You know your social media better than I do!\nstudent: Thank you\nstudent: But I felt like I need THE before Wikipedia too\nstudent: Maybe it's a false feeling )\nteacher: Yes, I know what you mean.\nteacher: like 'the Encyclopedia Britannica'\nteacher: or 'the Big Soviet Encyclopedia'\nstudent: Yes! Maybe it's because of 'pedia' )\nteacher: My favourite bit of the interview was when they were having a cup of tea on the bus :) and they spilled it (I now have Olivia's sense of humour)\nstudent: Are you here?\nteacher: hello\nstudent: Ah, ok\nstudent: It looks like the chat isn't working well today\nstudent: HI )\nteacher: hello hello\nteacher: hi\nstudent: kuku\nteacher: hello\nteacher: hi\nteacher: Oh my goodness, it's working!!!!\nteacher: Fingers crossed!!\nstudent: Yes )\nteacher: We're on)) Let's just hope it keeps working\nstudent: )\nteacher: Ok, how about we look back at our words, and you can try to remember who said them in the interview and what it was about, ok?\nstudent: Ok, Let's try )\nteacher: We've got 'hidden gems' and 'a (bus) fare'\nstudent: Ok it was about LA\nstudent: James Corden was talking about it\nteacher: Yes, James was going to show Harry the hidden gems of LA :)\nstudent: oh!\nstudent: I'm here now\nteacher: oh yes, me too\nteacher: So sorry about all this!\nstudent: Don't be sorry, it's not you fault\nteacher: thank you) and thanks for your patience\nstudent: no probs\nteacher: Ok! What about 'the one' and 'hit it off'?\nstudent: Actually I liked the interview but I think that Harry's behavior was sooo like it had to be )\nteacher: What do you mean?\nstudent: It was Harry who said the expressions. When they were talking about their dates with Meghan\nstudent: I mean he knows that he is public person and he behaves like that kind of person )\nteacher: Yes! And he said dating someone from the royal family is 'back to front', didn't he? in the wrong order\nteacher: Ha, well, he has to now!\nstudent: Yes. At first they just meet each other at home and then if everything ok they can go together to public places\nteacher: Yes, exactly\nstudent: like a cinema or a restaurant\nstudent: restaurant\nteacher: And they hit it off straightaway\nteacher: Yes, good correction!\nteacher: Ok, what about 'fiction' and something being 'loosely based on the truth'?\nstudent: They were talking about the Crown and Harry used the phrases\nteacher: Yes, absolutely!\nstudent: and he mixed up the names of actors, didn't he?\nstudent: not she, but he )\nteacher: Oh yes! James asked, who would he choose to play him\nteacher: And he said 'Damian Lewis' (it must be because he is ginger too)\nstudent: yes. Actually actors is not my strong point but I googled it ))\nteacher: Damian Lewis is much older than Prince Harry))\nteacher: Oh no, can you correct my grammar mistake? 'James asked who would he choose to play him'\nstudent: strong side?\nteacher: strong side, yes!\nteacher: You mean 'strong point' there, actually\nstudent: James asked who would he choose to play him'\nstudent: Ok, would chosen?\nstudent: I'm not sure\nteacher: Yes, I made a mistake in this sentence! Can you see it? The tense is right, but the word order is not\nstudent: Is it about an unreal thing?\nteacher: No, the forms of the verbs are correct!\nstudent: Ah! The order\nstudent: Ah! The order. Let me think\nstudent: him to play?\nteacher: James asked who he would choose to play him\nstudent: I'm not sure really )\nstudent: who he?\nteacher: we need the word order of an affirmative sentence after 'James asked'\nstudent: oho\nstudent: It looks strange )\nteacher: Yes, the direct question is 'Who would you choose...?'\nteacher: but when we report it, it's 'James asked who he would choose...'\nteacher: Yes, and James said he would play Prince William :)))\nteacher: which is 'not great casting, but it is casting' :)\nstudent: Yes, it was a nice joke )\nteacher: Yes, I enjoyed that too!\nstudent: yes, Harry's answer )\nteacher: Yes))\nteacher: Ok, what about waffles?\nstudent: I like the dialogue )\nteacher: Yes, so good!\nstudent: ok, the Queen sent them a waffle machine for Christmas\nteacher: Yes! So cute)))\nstudent: And they use it all the time because waffles are Archie's favorite dish\nteacher: Even though we now know she is not just a sweet old lady :)\nteacher: Yes, exactly!\nstudent: But maybe the Queen doesn't hate Meghan if she even sent them a waffle machine?\nstudent: haha\nteacher: Well, Harry says they have a good relationship with his grandmother!\nteacher: I think she doesn't\nstudent: Oh, actually\nstudent: Doesn't it seem strange to you\nstudent: that they appeared in two American shows at the same time?\nstudent: It looks like a PR action )\nstudent: I mean Harry and Meghan\nstudent: It looks like they have a plan )\nteacher: Yes, of course. Harry said that the Palace cut them off financially, so they have to be earning money themselves now\nstudent: Ah, ok )\nstudent: ok\nstudent: maybe\nteacher: And you know, they can't let people forget about them\nteacher: Ok, finally! an obstacle course\nstudent: it was about their last adventure\nteacher: Yes)\nstudent: This military thing\nstudent: It looks like James is sporty enough\nstudent: )\nteacher: Poor James was struggling a bit, wasn't he?\nteacher: But Harry's in a very good shape, actually\nstudent: Yes )\nteacher: But James Corden can sing very well :)\nteacher: Ok, thank you very much for sticking with it despite our technical difficulties today!\nstudent: Thank you!\nteacher: Have a lovely weekend!\nstudent: Have a good weekend XX\nstudent: bye\nteacher: Bye xx",

Is the program working for you?\nstudent: to be honest we didn't really want to sit together, we are sitting like this only becuse of her and our class teacher, but our class teacher knew what she was doing, she knew we could laugh\nstudent: The math teacher said that I would answer in the next lesson and MAYBE she would correct it\nteacher: Wow, I see! So you all hate your math teacher? She is new, isn't she?\nstudent: I was really sad about it, then she said smth to my class teacher and I heard a piece of what she said, 'maybe she is going to lie, don't believe her'\nstudent: yes she is new\nstudent: omg\nstudent: phew\nteacher: Oh no, the chatroom's gone crazy! It's been weird all day today\nstudent: so I asked my teacher for help, because she mustn't give me a mark for laughing\nteacher: Yes, it's not about your math ability!\nstudent: she literally said not to smile to one of our boys\nstudent: even if he was wearing a mask all the time\nteacher: Yes, I see.

Augustus Gloop! The great big greedy nincompoop! How long could we allow this beast To gorge and guzzle, feed and feast On everything he wanted to? Great Scott! It simply wouldn't do! However long this pig might live, We're positive he'd never give Even the smallest bit of fun Or happiness to anyone.\nstudent: hm\nstudent: I can't even guess\nteacher: It's a book that you know and love! You said so :.

I'll give you a couple more words, and you can guess what it is about\nteacher: 1. to rot .verb. If something like a piece of fruit or maybe something made of wood rots, it goes black and soft and is ruined\nteacher: The reason we put food in the fridge is so that it doesn't rot .go bad.\nteacher: the adjective is 'rotten'\nteacher: She bought a bag of apples, but three of them were rotten\nteacher: Ok?\nstudent: ok\nteacher: Ok, and one more word\nteacher: to clutter up\nteacher: If you clutter something up, you fill it with lots of things and it looks untidy\nteacher: His old house was all cluttered with old newspapers and rubbish\nstudent: ok\nteacher: Ok, a piece of another song from the Oompa-Loompas. Can you guess what it is about? What has this effect on children?\nteacher: IT ROTS THE SENSES IN THE HEAD! IT KILLS IMAGINATION DEAD! IT CLOGS AND CLUTTERS UP THE MIND! IT MAKES A CHILD SO DULL AND BLIND HE CAN NO LONGER UNDERSTAND A FANTASY, A FAIRYLAND! HIS BRAIN BECOMES AS SOFT AS CHEESE! HIS POWERS OF THINKING RUST AND FREEZE!

The most important thing we\u2019ve learned, So far as children are concerned, Is never, NEVER, NEVER let Them near your television set \u2014 Or better still, just don\u2019t install The idiotic thing at all. In almost every house we\u2019ve been, We\u2019ve watched them gaping at the screen.\nteacher: It sounds like Roald Dahl really didn't like TV :.\nstudent: yeah\nteacher: It's good that he didn't know about mobile phones :.\nteacher: And then, in the rest of the poem, the Oompa-Loompas talk about how books are much better than TV\nteacher: So of course, I'm curious to know if you agree with Oompa-Loompas and Roald Dahl :.\nstudent: I disagree\nteacher: Tell me more, please!\nstudent: of course TV can be bad for your eyes, but not the brain! and also, books are not always good for your eyes too!\nstudent: so it is stupid\nteacher: Yes, the best for your eyes is being outdoors and never reading off paper or screens :.\nteacher: But what about the brain?\nstudent: books also are not the best for your brain, because the author can make you think what's on his mind, for example, Roald Dahl and TV\nteacher: Haha, yes! They can influence you. I suppose, if you read a lot, then there are lots of ideas to choose from, so that you're not just influenced by the one\nstudent: yeah\nteacher: But I agree with you, I think both books and TV are here to be enjoyed and learn from. It's good to have a choice!\nteacher: Ok, thank you Sarah, I'll let you go enjoy your Friday afternoon!\nteacher: I hope you liked a bit of Roald Dahl in English :.\nstudent: okie\nstudent: thank you, bye bye!\nteacher: Bye :.",

Too much cabin fever at the moment!\nteacher: Good but fleeting :.\nstudent: Riight.. Feels like a solitary confinement except it's not solitary\nstudent: but with a child and an occasional child haha\nteacher: Yes, and without seeing much of anyone else, I feel we've turned into this three-body hybrid system, with interconnected states of mind\nteacher: Yes, exactly...\nteacher: Ah well, I suppose we're progressing as a country. This time last year people were fighting for a roll of toilet paper\nstudent: When is it going to clear up?\nteacher: and hitting each other with shopping trolleys to get to the last bag of pasta :...\nstudent: Omg\nteacher: We'll be allowed day trips on March 29! But shops are still closed until mid-\nteacher: mid-\nteacher: oh goodness\nteacher: mid-April! :..\nstudent: It's just so sad...\nteacher: Yes, we're so easily reduced to a completely uncivilized state\nteacher: By the way, a quick grammar quiz.\nstudent: Exactly. Marcus and I were discussing it today in the morning. It's so easy to slip into chaos even after all those advances of humanity\nteacher: I saw him grab the last bag of pasta. vs. I saw him grabbing the last bag of pasta\nteacher: What's the difference?\nteacher: Yes, it was absolute madness this time last year!

I've just been annotating one of our previous chats, and this grammar point came up there\nstudent: Oh really\nstudent: Was it my mistake then?\nteacher: A tiny little one, don't worry. I'm just explaining where I'm coming from.\nstudent: By the way, how do you find this annotating routine? Is it annoying?\nstudent: Ok. Sure!\nteacher: It's not as exciting as teaching, but it's a great opportunity for professional self-reflection :. and I know it's important to prepare our chats for research\nteacher: Nice quiet work, quite painstaking\nstudent: I hope you're getting decently paid because you're doing a hell of a job. And you're doing it unlike anyone else\nstudent: a hell?....\nteacher: Aww, thank you! the University of Cambridge is looking after me well, don't worry :.\nteacher: a hell, yes!\nstudent: Haha. one of many\nteacher: I wonder if it's because of the 'of-phrase' :.\nstudent: a hell...\nteacher: Yes, indeed, one of many personal hells :.\nstudent: Right. It's strange, isn't it?\nstudent: a hell here might just mean a version\nstudent: I dunno\nteacher: Hmmm\nteacher: I'm thinking about hell now, but it's not going anywhere :..\nteacher: People also say 'one hell of a .job.'\nteacher: so I suppose 'a' is just instead of 'one'\nstudent: I've heard that one too\nstudent: probably\nteacher: Yes, you must have!\nteacher: Ok, I've got a bit more article practice for you!\nteacher: Don't thank me :.\nteacher: And then we can dissect a bit more of 'Tom said' jokes!\nstudent: Let's do it!\nteacher: Cool! In this one, you have a news headline and you need to unpack it into a sentence with articles. Here's an example\nteacher: TV corrupts young says Minister of Education\nteacher: The Minister of Education has said that television corrupts the young.\nteacher: Ok?\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: a.

Samantha's favourite kind of party.\nteacher: We did 'crabby', 'listless' and 'with wanton disregard' last time, didn't we?\nstudent: What is a joke party?\nstudent: A special kind?\nteacher: Noo, Samantha's invention. When you tell each other jokes :.\nteacher: I meant our 'Tom said' jokes\nstudent: Aaaa\nteacher: Sorry, it does sound like a fake party of something, now that I'm thinking about it\nteacher: as in 'This party is a joke!'\nstudent: I thought there's a special type of kids' parties I don't know about\nstudent: I thought of your Samantha\nteacher: Yes, I meant my Samantha! Sorry, I completely confused you now\nteacher: Ok! crabby, listless, and with wanton disregard\nstudent: Yes, I remember them\nteacher: which one means 'lacking energy and enthusiasm'?\nstudent: listless\nteacher: Yes! And what's crabby?\nstudent: Slipped my mind.\nteacher: irritated and grumpy\nstudent: It's just that I have such positive associations with a crab.\nteacher: Haha, they have grumpy faces I think :.\nstudent: When I wake 7 times a night in the morning I feel crabby\nstudent: Right?\nteacher: Ouch! Yes, correct, but ouch for you!\nteacher: Ok, a quick joke for you!\nstudent: No-no, I slept fine\nstudent: It's just for the sake of an example\nteacher: Which is why you're probably having a nice day, right?\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: Ah, good!\nteacher: \u2022 'I love hot dogs,' said Tom with relish.\nstudent: ahaha\nteacher: Yeah, you've got it? both meanings? :..\nstudent: relish 1. what you add to the hot dog together with the sausage\nstudent: ?\nteacher: and 2. the enjoyment you get from doing something\nstudent: with pleasure\nstudent: something like\nteacher: The child ate her ice cream slowly and with relish\nteacher: Yes, exactly!\nstudent: Cool!\nteacher: Yes, this one if my favourite I think :.\nteacher: Ok! I'll let you go, thank you, have a lovely evening!\nteacher: *is my favourite\nstudent: Thank you for the lesson!\nstudent: Time flew fast\nteacher: It's a pleasure!\nstudent: See you next week!\nteacher: Time flies when you're thinking about English articles :..\nstudent: Oh my\nstudent: That's so true\nteacher: Take care! bye! :.\nstudent: Bye!!",
    "student: Hello!\nteacher: Hi Emma Smith!\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: Good thank you. How about you?\nteacher: All good, thanks!\nteacher: Have you had the time to do the reading part?\nstudent: I had time to do the first exercise and part of the second one...\nstudent: so better than nothing I guess ;.\nteacher: Ok, sure!\nteacher: Absolutely! How did you find the tasks?\nstudent: Well, I was expecting to solve them in less time, but you really need to read through them...\nstudent: I see that there are many sentences and expressions that aren't very common...I would say I managed to do a decent job anyway, but I guess I can ask you about a few expressions ;.\nstudent: Anyway given the right amount of time I think they are not too hard :.\nteacher: Yes, they are deep-reading rather than scanning exercises. Having said that, once you know how the task works and know what you're looking for, the process speeds up considerably .and we'll work on those techniquies.\nstudent: I believe part 5 can be tricky...anyway, I can copy paste the answers for that one, and some expressions I found difficult if you want\nteacher: Ok, shall we check the answers then? Could you send me your answers to questions 31-36 .part 1.\nteacher: Sorry, part 5!\nteacher: Use of English and Reading used to be two papers, I guess I'm still thinking of part 5 as reading part 1\nstudent: 31. C, 32. C, 33. D., 34. B, 35. A .?. 36. C....I wasn't sure about a few answers, but particularly about 35\nteacher: Ok, why did you go for A in 35?\nstudent: To begin, I don't know the meaning of the expression: 'this was something of a plum', but I guess it means something along the lines of 'this was a positive thing' referring to her age..\nstudent: I realize now that, if this is the case, probably C would be more suitable...\nteacher: Oh, a plum job is a good one, a job worth having\nstudent: As the others are true but only because we have 'an outside view', while she doesn't know\nteacher: Aha, I see what you're saying. A plum doesn't mean an advantage here!\nteacher: Yes, exactly, we need to say what she thought, 'on reflection'\nteacher: Anyway, why did you choose A .it's the right answer, by the way.?\nstudent: Because she refuses to call it luck...and tries to find explanations not involving luck but some of her qualities (even the age)\nteacher: Could you find a phrase in the text that means 'because she deserved it'? It's that penultimate paragraph that starts with ''Later,'\nstudent: She must have got the job on her merits'\nteacher: Yes, absolutely!\nteacher: There is 'evidence' for each correct answer in the text. If a candidate is taking a paper-based version of the test, it might be useful to underline it\nteacher: For example, you would underline 'she must have got the job on her merits' and put '35' next to it\nstudent: I see, that makes sense...especially when reviewing at the end (if there is time for it!)\nteacher: Yes, exactly, it makes reviewing at the end very easy!\nteacher: I won't be torturing you further and will just say that you got all the answers right :.\nteacher: But just for practice, could you find evidence in the text, for, say, number 32?\nstudent: Haha, okay great!\nteacher: Yes, very well done!\nstudent: In this trade, she saw, you needed not so much to be abreast of things as ahead of them, lying in wait for circumstance, ready to pounce.'\nstudent: thank you\nteacher: Exactly! You get the idea :.\nteacher: What were you questions, anyway?\nteacher: *your\nstudent: For example in this sentence I am not sure about the meaning of 'to be abreast of things'...and also the expression 'ready to pounce' is something new to me. I believe it means 'always ready to promptly deliver'...\nteacher: Oh, a cat pounces when it jumps onto its prey and grabs it\nteacher: or a big cat like a lion etc. :.\nstudent: I see\nteacher: And, if you and someone else are moving abreast, you are next to each other\nteacher: For example, in the UK, if you are cycling with your child, you are allowed to cycle abreast, with your child's bike between you and the pavement\nteacher: And cars aren't supposed to honk at you\nstudent: hmm...wait, the pavement is the ground, right? I don't understand...\nstudent: the location of the child's bike\nteacher: Oh, sorry, the pavement is a part of a road where pedestrians go\nstudent: Ohhh now it makes sense\nteacher: Sidewalk! It's what Americans call 'sidewalk'\nstudent: I have to memorize this, pavement not sidewalk\nstudent: okay, now it makes sense!\nteacher: Haha, well, do your colleagues at work mostly use American English? And you lived in the US, I seem to remember\nteacher: Oh no, was it South America though?\nteacher: Yes, bikes aren't supposed to go on the pavement .but they do all the time. and parents and children are supposed to ride abreast .but they hardly every do.\nstudent: I am in Austria...my colleagues are Austrian so they don't speak natively\nstudent: I see, I don't know if in Italy that's allowed\nstudent: *native English\nteacher: Yes, sure\nteacher: Shall we move on to the next part?\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: Ok, cool!\nteacher: Which ones have you done?\nstudent: 37. D, 38. H , 39. A...but to be honest I am sure only about the first one\nstudent: This is really a time-dependent task, and I didn't manage to read everything properly\nteacher: Ok, great. Actually, with this task, you're looking for links between paragraphs. The text really is very big, but there are distinct links that can help to complete the task without reading everyting in-depth\nteacher: The first two are correct, let's try to find those links\nteacher: One second\nteacher: Why is the first one D?\nstudent: (I also think this is easier to do on paper as you can cross out the sentences you used and see what is remaning)\nteacher: Yes, definitely. But I think, if you happen to take the computer-based version of the test, you can drag-and-drop paragraphs, which is quite helpful visually\nstudent: Hmm...now that I am reading it I am not sure anymore\nstudent: I think it was the beginning: 'In times gone by, all seven islands...' and then the story goes on\nstudent: in the paragraph 'Sometime in the last century, the last of the trees on high ground were'\nteacher: Yes, exactly. The first paragraph: how Spanish sailors found the Canaries .flourishing agriculture.. Paragraph 2 .D.: deforestation begins Paragraph 3: the last of the trees are cut down\nteacher: Also, .D. gives us the name of the island. In the first paragraph, it's just 'the Canaries', and in paragraph 3 they are talking about 'the north of the island', so we're supposed to know which island it is\nteacher: Something that D fills in for us\nstudent: could 39. be F, since it talks about fog not touching the ground...and then there is a paragraph about fog harvesting? But I still have a problem with the previous paragraph talking about Chile..\nteacher: One sec, I'll look at 39\nteacher: Yes, correct! Riebold explains why saplings died without fog harvesting\nteacher: By the way, to go back to 38, there is such a good link there. The next paragraph starts with 'these failed efforts', so you know that 38 needs to be the description of the failed efforts\nstudent: Oh, I didn't notice...but yes, I should have noticed that...\nteacher: Ok, we've got 37 D, 38 H, 39 F\nteacher: Would you like to have a go at 40?\nstudent: 40 B since the previous paragraph tells about the first project starting\nstudent: And in B you have some results of these first trials (2 liters collected, when 1 was enough)\nteacher: Yes, and also the following paragraph says 'having declared the initial project a success' .so we need a success story for 40.\nteacher: Correct\nstudent: .when 1 would have been enough...? Are both these expression okay?.\nteacher: 1 would have been enough .but they had two, so it's a conditional.\nteacher: vs. They collected 1 litre for each tree, and that was enough.\nstudent: I see, okay thank you :.\nteacher: No problem. 41?\nstudent: I don't know...there is a line about irrigation which could be linked to farmers .and thus G.\nteacher: Ok, let's leave 41 for now. What about 42? There's a very clear link in the first sentence of the following paragraph\nstudent: 42 A\nstudent: the paragraph ends by talking about a bigger project covering 50 square kilometers\nstudent: and A starts by talking about a more ambitious scheme\nteacher: But the knock-on effect of reviving the forest goes beyond restoring wildlife'\nteacher: Which means that the paragraph should talk about... restoring wildlife\nstudent: Oh, in that case it's E\nteacher: Yes, correct!\nstudent: then 43 is G, I guess, since the next paragraph begins with 'Whether or not fog harvesting will prompt a large- scale return to agriculture'\nteacher: I see what you're saying about 'this more ambitious scheme' with A, actually, but it doesn't work with the following paragraph\nteacher: Absolutely, we finally get to the farmers in 43\nteacher: So you've now used D, H, F, B, E and G\nteacher: The options for 41 are A and C\nstudent: I guess C\nstudent: I guess it's C...but why...mm\nstudent: I don't see clear links to be honest\nteacher: No, there aren't. C is suddenly a story about the past, doesn't really work here\nteacher: I've got to let you go, it's obviously A byt he process of elimination. If you have a minute to see why later on, that could be part of the homework, together with the last task if you have the time\nstudent: Okay, I will do that...I guess now I will take a break because my mind really is a bit foggy ;.\nstudent: Thank you for the lesson! Have a nice week!\nteacher: Missing paragraphs' is probably the most challenging reading task, well done, you're almost there!\nteacher: You too, have a lovely week, speak to you next Tuesday!\nstudent: Thank you! You too... see you on Tuesday!",
    "student: Hi, Ms. Roberts!\nteacher: Hiya!\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: Fine, thank you\nstudent: How are you?\nstudent: Sophia is at school now?\nteacher: Yes, he is! It's the last week before Easter holidays\nstudent: Ah! I see\nstudent: Are the holidays going to be long? Or just one more day off?\nteacher: My sister told me it was snowing in Kyiv this morning!\nstudent: Yes! It is a dark day with some snow .\nstudent: A typical spring day .....\nteacher: Two weeks :. He's very looking forward to it. I'll let you know about lessons during the holiday period later on, ok? Just working on my timetable at the moment\nstudent: Ah! It is like a spring vacation here in Ukraine\nteacher: Yes, indeed, typical spring! It's not warm here either, but it's not nearly as cold!\nteacher: Yes, that's right!\nstudent: But we have just 1 week I think\nstudent: You know we have a new lockdown now\nteacher: English children only get 6 weeks in the summer, but Easter and Christmas holidays are two weeks\nteacher: Yes, you told me! One second\nstudent: And I think it's the first week of the spring vacations for kids\nstudent: Usually they have one week but now I think they have one more because of Covid\nteacher: Easter holiday in Ukraine = 1 week; in the UK = 2 weeks. Could you make a sentence comparing Easter holidays in Ukraine and the UK?\nstudent: Ok .\nstudent: Easter holiday(s?) in the UK is (are?) longer than in Ukraine\nstudent: Can I use vacations like kanikuly?\nteacher: Yes, sure! We can stick to holidays .plural. for now. Vacation is an American word!\nstudent: Because here we don't call it Easter holidays it doesn't depend on Easter really .\nteacher: British people go on holiday while Americans go on vacation :.\nstudent: ok\nteacher: Yes, true! just as an example\nstudent: they have different places to rest .\nstudent: *they\nteacher: Ok, what about: Easter holidays in Ukraine are not ___ ___ ___ in the UK\nstudent: as long as\nteacher: Yes!\nteacher: And to express that Easter holidays in Ukraine are 1/2 of Easter holidays in the UK... Easter holidays in Ukraine are ___ as long as in the UK\nstudent: not\nteacher: Yes, but I mean to express taht it's 1/2\nteacher: Easter holidays in Ukraine are half as long as in the UK, remember this one?\nstudent: Ah\nstudent: sorry\nteacher: No worries\nstudent: I didn't catch it\nstudent: No, I don't unfortunately .\nteacher: And the other way round! Easter holidays in the UK are ___ as long as in Ukraine .x2.\nstudent: twice as long as?\nteacher: Yaay, well done!\nteacher: Nothing like a bit of grammar revision on Monday :.\nstudent: hahaha\nstudent: it's like a cup of coffee in the morning ..\nstudent: bodrit'....\nteacher: Ok, so what's going on with the lockdown?\nteacher: Definitely!\nstudent: it wakes me up?\nteacher: What are you allowed to do?\nstudent: bodrit .\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: Yes, it wakes you up!\nstudent: Actually I can go to work and I like it ..\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: A good expression is to 'blow the cobwebs away'\nstudent: It's no as strict as you had\nstudent: So shops and restaurants don't work\nteacher: You know 'cobwebs', things that spiders make?\nteacher: It's not ___ strict as you have\nstudent: But you still can order food from restaurants and pick it up\nstudent: Also essentials work too of course\nteacher: Ok, sure, that makes sense!\nstudent: Food shops, pharmacies\nteacher: Right, sure! Are people allowed to meet?\nstudent: And the beauty sphere is open\nstudent: On Saturday I had my eyebrows done at G.Bar .\nteacher: Ok, I see! It's all closed here\nteacher: The UK lockdown is ___ stricter than the Ukrainian one\nstudent: And I'm going to the face massage on Wednesday morning\nstudent: The UK lockdown is much stricter than the Ukrainian one\nteacher: Naughty naughty you! We're not allowed any of that!\nstudent: And about meeting people\nteacher: Yes, well done! which means that... The Ukrainian lockdown is __ __ ___ ___ the UK one\nstudent: Actually we haven't had any restrictions during any of our lockdowns .\nstudent: Maybe the government understand that it wouldn't work here in Ukraine ... I don't know .\nteacher: Yes, I suppose the government can't afford to furlough people\nstudent: The Ukrainian lockdown is not as strict as the UK one\nstudent: to furlough?\nteacher: Here, people who can't work because of covid receive 80% of their salaries from the government. It's called furlough\nteacher: No one knew this word until a year ago!\nteacher: Well, maybe except for economists\nstudent: Ah\nstudent: I see\nstudent: Yes, unfortunately we don't have it here\nstudent: except FOR? .\nstudent: I have to remember .\nstudent: to\nteacher: Sorry, my laptop's being slow again!\nstudent: it's ok .\nstudent: don't worry\nteacher: except for, yes\nteacher: Just trying to write the transcription for you\nstudent: I saw David had posted something about laptops for you ...\nteacher: /\u02c8f\u025c\u02d0.l\u0259\u028a/\nteacher: Got it at last!\nteacher: Oh sorry, missed your response about 'the lockdown is not as strict as' - correct!\nteacher: Yes, and of course, if there's no furlough money, I suppose they can't close businesses!\nstudent: it happens here in the chat\nstudent: But they did\nteacher: Oh yes, restaurants, of course!\nstudent: Shops and restaurants have huge losses here\nstudent: losses? Damages?\nstudent: *shops\nteacher: Yes, correct, losses!\nstudent: And what about beauty there in the UK?\nteacher: Damage can also be used to talk about business, let me have a think about what the difference is!\nstudent: Did you have a chance to have your hair cut?\nteacher: Oh, everything's closed! I haven't been able to have a haircut since before Christmas, and they will only re-open in mid-April\nstudent: Ah, I see\nteacher: No nail, eyebrow, massage appointments etc. etc.\nstudent: But I like long hair .\nteacher: Oh no, I really need a haircut!\nstudent: I hear that the quality of beauty services abroad is not as high as here in Ukraine\nstudent: What do you think, if you compare?\nteacher: Ok, damages .plural. is the money that that a person or organization is ordered by a court of law to pay to another person or organization because they are responsible for harming them in some way\nteacher: dictionary definition\nstudent: aha\nstudent: it's not losses\nteacher: For example, Meghan Markle took one of the British newspapers to court for printing her private letter. She won the case, and now this newspaper has to pay her damages\nstudent: more like kompensacia\nteacher: No, it's different! Yes, that's right\nstudent: Thank you\nteacher: No problem\nteacher: Beauty services! Yes, so much better and more affordable in Ukraine!\nstudent: I see\nteacher: In my opinion :.\nstudent: I think it's a good chance to have a good job for Ukrainian beauty specialists if they move to the UK for example\nteacher: But then, the whole beauty philosophy is different in the UK\nstudent: good and good\nstudent: ...\nteacher: Yes, true!\nstudent: What do you mean?\nstudent: About philosophy .\nteacher: Well, I'm thinking what's the best way to describe it\nteacher: For example, I know lots of women who don't wear much make-up and don't invest in beauty treatments very much\nteacher: here in the UK\nteacher: But not in Ukraine!\nstudent: Ah I see\nstudent: Actually I've changed my philosophy too\nteacher: Obviously, there are lots of very fashion- and make-up-conscious people here\nstudent: I prefer now not to spend money on my nails for example but to spend the sum on a face massage instead\nteacher: I think it also depends on where I live :. Maybe it would be different for me if I lived in London, not in the countryside\nstudent: I don't meant it's the same sum\nstudent: but ...\nstudent: sorry\nstudent: but I'm just trying to \u7709spokoit' myself .\nteacher: Yes, I get it! You prefer to invest in in healthy skin rather than make-up, is this what you're saying?\nstudent: Yes\nstudent: it's true!\nstudent: make myself calm\nteacher: I would say there is less pressure on women here to wear make-up etc.\nstudent: make calm?\nstudent: But I think it's a tree now\nteacher: For example, when I used to come to work without much make-up in Ukraine, my colleagues would sometimes comment that I should have worn some :. Which would be extremely rude here, but is quite normal in Ukraine, isn't it?\nteacher: Hmm, you're trying to comfort yourself?\nteacher: I think 'comfort' is a better verb here\nstudent: so here in Ukraine, I mean Kyiv maybe .. lots of girls wear less make-up, don't wear heels and skirts etc.\nstudent: etc.\nteacher: Ok! Things are changing then!\nstudent: comfort! Yes!\nstudent: I'm pretty sure\nteacher: This is connected with gender stereotypes, of course\nstudent: it's like a worldwide trend\nstudent: But I still like make-up ...00\nteacher: It's a cool trend, I like it! More casual\nteacher: I like wearing some make-up too :.\nteacher: Ok, speaking of make-up and fashion and British women, Alexa Chung!\nstudent: Actually, Sophie was very surprised (and happy) that I have a pair of high-heeled shoes .\nteacher: We haven't got much time, but we can at least start\nteacher: Haha, like Barbie?\nstudent: Yes .....\nteacher: Brilliant...\nstudent: I even let her wear them .\nstudent: I let her..\nteacher: Ok, what did you think of the interview in general? Have you been following Alexa and her work for a long time?\nstudent: But it's funny because she didn't know that I had high-heeled shoes\nstudent: I like Alexa\nstudent: She is a beautiful and smart woman I think\nstudent: I like the voice and pronunciation\nstudent: It's just about my feelings about her .\nstudent: Ah! And of course I really love her style\nteacher: Yes, she's got a very posh accent :.\nstudent: I think the interview is very useful for me but not like an instruction in how to build a business\nteacher: Speaking of high-heeled shoes, people just call them 'heels' for short\nstudent: but more like motivation\nteacher: Yes, and inspiration!\nteacher: Business and fashion\nstudent: Yes, she's got a very posh accent :. I like it! Really!\nstudent: I feel like I have the same thoughts\nteacher: Very easy to understand! You will like Lisa Eldridge and her make-up tutorials too, she's got a very similar accent :.\nstudent: And same hesitations\nstudent: Oh! We had a synonym for hesitations I think before\nteacher: I remember! Hesitations is very good here, actually, as a noun\nteacher: We spoke about the verb 'dither'\nteacher: Do I buy a dress from Alexa Chung or do I buy one from H&amp;M? I'm dithering!\nstudent: Actually even 1 or 2 years ago I thought that motivation videos were useless\nteacher: #ERROR!\nstudent: But now I think it depends on the message\nstudent: And the form\nteacher: Yes, this is really her story, isn't it? Rather than just a silly motivational video\nstudent: dither! Yes!\nteacher: What are you dithering about? Whether to branch out into a fashion business? :.\nstudent: haha\nstudent: today\nstudent: today I was speaking with my friend from Switzerland\nstudent: And I told her that I'm dithering about the money I should give to charity\nstudent: Because I understand that I can't help everyone and I have been dithering about it\nstudent: Oh, no\nteacher: Oh yes, this is difficult!\nstudent: I'm dithering about\nstudent: dithering about it or dithering about it\nstudent: ?\nteacher: I always think, I will give to charities that are important to me, and some other charities are important to other people, and they will give to them. But there are a lot of charities that are important to me!\nstudent: I see\nteacher: just 'I'm dithering about it'\nstudent: Ok! Thank you!\nteacher: No worries!\nteacher: Ok, we've got to wrap up for today! It went too fast as usual! We can work on the words from the interview on Friday, ok?\nstudent: ok! Thank you!!\nstudent: I like our chats\nstudent: time flies .\nteacher: Me too :. always a pleasure!\nstudent: Have a good day\nstudent: bye bye xx\nteacher: Thank you! You too! Speak to you on Friday :.",
    "student: Hi Mrs. Anderson!\nteacher: Hi Emma Smith!\nstudent: How are you?\nteacher: How are you?\nteacher: All good, thank you!\nstudent: I am good thank you :. Finally I can go back to the office from time to time!\nstudent: I guess 'I can finally go back...' would have been a better word-ordering...anyway everything is good\nteacher: Oh really? Oh yes, I remember, you mentioned it last time! Have you been yet? Do you have to wear a mask and take precautions?\nstudent: except for the pandemic...\nteacher: Yes, I can finally go back does sound better!\nstudent: I am there currently...I have to be tested every second day, wear an FFP2 mask in the common areas...\nstudent: but it is a nice change, from time to time\nteacher: Right, I see! I can imagine. Does it mean things are looking up in Austria in terms of corona?\nstudent: Hmm, I am not sure about the meaning of the expression 'things are looking up'...if it means that cases are increasing...you are right.\nstudent: Germany has already started a strong lockdown, I believe Austria will follow suit if things go on like this...\nteacher: Oh no, the opposite. If things are looking up, the situation is improving. I'm sorry to hear this is not the case!\nteacher: Oh no, that's bad news! Very sorry to hear that!\nteacher: Today's the anniversary of the first lockdown in the UK\nstudent: I see...Austria and Italy both went in lockdown earlier about a week ago...\nteacher: Yes, I've read about the third wave in Italy... Awful!\nstudent: Hmm, no, I guess more than a week ago, but I can't remember exactly when...unfortunately vaccinations are not going as initially planned\nstudent: there are few doses and politicians mishandled the vaccine situation when blocking AstraZeneca, if you ask me....\nstudent: now a lot of people do not trust it anymore...the press has its share of fault too, unfortunately...\nteacher: Yes, that was my impression too. It all got really political .probably reflecting a worsened relationship with the UK.. But AstraZeneca is a tried and tested vaccine, and people suffer as a result of this row\nteacher: Oh, I see! Yes, this is really bad! Trust is everything\nstudent: Last week our childminder was supposed to get a jab, but had a last minute panic attack and decided to refuse to take it...\nteacher: Right, I see. It's the worst!\nstudent: She has a difficult situation in her family, so we were sort of expecting this, but still it tells about the responsibility of the press and politics...\nteacher: Yes, definitely! Such a shame though.\nteacher: They'll have to work hard to get back on track!\nstudent: Yes, but it will take years for the public to rebuild the trust towards vaccines...\nstudent: Indeed...Anyhow, I see you sent me a pdf...before the lesson I also did the last exercise of the paper\nteacher: You know what, 'to get jabbed' sounds like she was about to be punched. 'to get the jab' would be better here\nstudent: Oh, I see..that is quite a difference indeed...\nstudent: she was going to get the jab...\nteacher: Oh lovely, let me get my answer key for the reading, feel free to type your answers here\nteacher: Yes, a subtle difference!\nteacher: Ready when you are!\nstudent: I am not too sure about all of them... 44 D,B 45 E, 46 C, 47 B, 48 A, 49 E, 50 B, 51 D, 52 A, 53 A,C\nstudent: but I tried to look for 'sentences which directly connect to the paragraph'...unfortunately I didn't print the paper so I couldn't underline them\nteacher: Yes, this is the right approach!\nteacher: What about 44 and 53? Are you not sure which one fits better?\nstudent: Oh, I misread the assignment: I believed a line could be assigned to multiple paragraphs too\nstudent: which greatly increased my uncertainty about the overall result\nstudent: I would go with 44 B\nteacher: Ah, this is sometimes the case .two answers to one question., but then there would have been two numbers\nteacher: For example, in which paragraph does the author express his disappointment in his friend 55. 56.\nstudent: I see...actually for the 53 I am unsure, A\nteacher: and you could answer in either order, not necessarily alphabetically\nteacher: Ok, why is 44 B then?\nstudent: when the technology was invented, in the form of photography, the social and cultural impact was immense.\nteacher: Aha, I see. This is in the past though, and the question is about the possibility that photography can influence events in the world .at present.\nstudent: I see, while the first sentence of D is indeed describing the possibility of change in the current time\nstudent: whether photography possesses the voice and power to instigate social change.\nteacher: Exactly!\nteacher: 44. D then :.\nteacher: what about 53? why did you choose A?\nstudent: I was going to answer with the sentence: ' the photographic medium has provided one of the most important and influential means of capturing the essence of our being alive.' but this justifies 52 A...\nstudent: so I believe I chose the wrong paragraph\nteacher: Yes, this is exactly right :.\nteacher: Your other idea was C, do you think that one holds water?\nstudent: Yes, its second sentence is quite explicit about this: 'It was seen not only as the culmination of visual representation...'\nteacher: Absolutely!\nstudent: I guess it really is easier to do these exercises with pen and paper...\nteacher: Everything else is correct, just those two that you were unsure about\nstudent: Great!\nteacher: Yes, I believe so! If you do take the exam one day, you might have a choice of paper-based or computer-based format, depending on the exam centre\nstudent: I will make sure to ask beforehand about this possibility\nteacher: And it's a bit awkward to be switching between windows here all the time, but I really wanted to give you a taste of what the exam is like\nteacher: Mind you, the computer-based format should be equally convenient. For once, you won't have a pdf, it will all be in one program\nstudent: I see :. Well, I will think about it...for now I would say that I need to study a bit, but I could definitely do the exam :.\nteacher: Well, there's probably no urgency for you, is there? But it's a nice way to motivate oneself if necessary\nteacher: Ok, before we move on I'll just say that I'll take two weeks off teaching because my son will be home for Easter holidays. I can offer you the next class on Tuesday April 13 if the time is still good for you\nstudent: No, indeed, but it is nice to see that it is something I could definitely do well, after some studying and with some tips on how to do the different exercises\nstudent: Yes, that is okay with me :.\nteacher: Yes, exactly!\nteacher: Lovely! Have you got any nice plans for the less-than-ideal Easter? Are you going to make something nice?\nstudent: If the weather is good I will hire an Easter bunny...\nstudent: meaning I will hide some chocolates in the garden, the kids love it :.\nteacher: Ooh, yes, the egg hunt! It's a must here :.\nstudent: but I don't think we will do much more...we might go to Vienna this weekend for Palm Sunday, but I don't know...the covid situation is really precarious\nstudent: What about you? Will you do some travelling for Easter?\nteacher: It sounds like you are where we were in January :. we're so used to being locked down now, no one's enterntaining any thoughts of going anywhere...\nstudent: .Maybe the correct way to write it 'we will go to Vienna for Palm Sunday? I am really unsure here.\nteacher: Well, the only thing we'll be able to do is go for a drive, to the seaside or the forest or one of the beautiful gardens\nteacher: Yes, I think it's Palm Sunday, no article!\nstudent: That's already a nice idea :. Hopefully we will do that too during Easter...but I am deliberately keeping my vacation for later on, in the hope of going to Italy :.\nteacher: Wait, what did you mean? the verb? will / might?\nteacher: Yes, I can imagine, save your holidays!\nteacher: or vacations, in American English\nstudent: .no it was about the article...I changed the verb because it was easier to type....\nstudent: You are right, my holidays...\nteacher: Sure. Might is a very good verb there :.\nteacher: No, it's good either way! nothing wrong with American words :.\nstudent: unfortunately the Italian word for holidays is 'vacation', so this is a typical mistake that English teachers in Italy will correct...\nteacher: Ah yes, of course it is!\nstudent: Sorry, the Italian word is 'vacanza', not vacation ;.\nteacher: Sure\nteacher: Ok, let's have a quick look at the writing paper I sent you, ok? Let's focus on part 2 at the moment. .It's got 2 parts, 90 minutes to write both tasks.\nteacher: It's page 4 in the pdf\nstudent: Okay, I am there :.\nstudent: I have a question: in order to write number 5 I need to have read the book, is that correct?\nteacher: Great! The task is set for you in part 1, but you have a choice out of a few options in part 2. Could you have a quick look and tell me which one looks most appealing to you? And which one would be best to write about .in terms of showing off good language.\nteacher: Yes, that's right! In fact, not only do you need to have read the book, but you also need to have a relatively fresh memory of it, to know how to spell names of characters etc.\nteacher: Which is why the book review task is a very rare choice among candidates and exam teachers :.\nstudent: Therefore number 5 is out of question in this case .I actually have the book 'Girl With a Pearl Earring', but in the recent years I've been piling up some books because I have less time to read....\nteacher: Yes, I can relate to that!\nstudent: I believe the easiest would be number 4...\nteacher: I haven't read either of them, unfortunately\nteacher: Yes, number 4 is a good choice!\nstudent: To do well in the other examples I would need some language knowledge of specific fields, e.g. architecture, which I don't really have\nteacher: I'll just say here that you can pick an imaginary as well as a real situation in your life. Some people find it easier to write about imaginary situations, and vice versa\nstudent: I think I have the best real-life example ;. Should I write the letter here?\nteacher: Well, if you are describing a building, again, no one is looking for historical accuracy or the correct identification of an architectural style\nstudent: Sentence by sentence, and you'll comment along the way?\nteacher: Hold on, one second!\nstudent: Okay! I have also noticed it is already 13:52\nteacher: For example, I was doing the 'desribing the building' task with my other C2 student, and she was describing a famous museum. She went, 'It was built in 1898'. True historically, but pretty much worthless in terms of earning language proficiency points!\nstudent: I see...\nstudent: I need to use complex words, and show my proficiency...\nstudent: But it is difficult to do that while stating the date of something being built...\nteacher: Yes, exactly!\nteacher: One second, just looking for a good example\nteacher: But in case of 'an important decision in your life', you can think in terms of third conditionals .If I had not done that, this and that would not have happened.\nteacher: Inversions .always for C2. Little did I know... etc.\nteacher: And of course, nice complex words!\nteacher: Oh yes, and, as you have seen, it's a letter, so you'll need to start with 'Dear Sir or Madam.'\nstudent: Okay, then I'll do that as homework... :.\nteacher: Sorry about a rushed introduction. Would you like to write it as homework over the break?\nteacher: If not, we can always do it sentence by sentence next time\nteacher: Oh yes, sorry, I've just seen your reply. Great!\nstudent: I think it is better if I try to do it alone, thinking a bit about what I am writing.\nteacher: And the word count is important, too!\nstudent: No problem :. Then enjoy your holidays! .Okay, I'll keep track of that.\nteacher: Sure! I\nstudent: Bye!!\nteacher: Lovely, you too, have a lovely time, speak to you soon!",
    "student: Hello Ms. Johnson!\nteacher: Hi Emily!\nteacher: How's it going?\nstudent: It's going well. Thanks. How are things with you?\nteacher: I'm good, thank you :.\nstudent: Still going through the tough lockdown?\nstudent: It has arrived in Kyiv now\nteacher: Sophia will be on holiday for the next two weeks, so I'll have to postpone classes until April 12\nteacher: It's nearly Easter here!\nstudent: Right. The Catholic Easter is earlier, isn't it?\nteacher: Yes, I've heard about another lockdown in Kyiv, I'm sorry to hear about that! Is it affecting your life very much at all?\nstudent: No problem with postponing the classes whatsoever. I have had so much on my plate recently.\nstudent: You know, it isn't really. Nothing changed much for my family. But we take extra precautions now.\nteacher: We're in the second stage of the lockdown, moving on to the third one on Monday. We will soon be allowed trips out .as in to forests / parks / the seaside., but we still can't stay over anywhere .for example, we can't visit David's parents. and non-essential shops are still closed\nstudent: OMG. It must be so exhausting.\nteacher: Yes, sure! You both have been working online, haven't you?\nteacher: It's been a very long winter, yes! But what can we do\nteacher: Yes, Easter is on April 4 here\nstudent: I work online and offline at ALMA and it didn't affect the offline part\nstudent: Do you have some quests prepared for Sophia?\nstudent: sorry 5 sec\nteacher: Yes, sure! Well, there's going to be an egg hunt in the garden as usual :.\nstudent: I'm sorry\nstudent: It was a delivery man\nstudent: The payment couldn't go through\nstudent: I had to change 4 cards\nteacher: No worries!\nstudent: Should I say 'a delivery man' or 'the delivery man'?\nteacher: Answering the door to delivery men is my part-time job :..\nstudent: An egg hunt! Cool! I want to prepare something like that for Sophia. Are those real eggs that people use in an egg hunt?\nstudent: Oh... Same here\nteacher: Hmm, I would say, if I had known you'd been expecting a delivery, it would 'the delivery man'\nstudent: Sometimes I feel like I work at a call center\nteacher: But for me, it was 'a delivery man', because it was the first time you mentioned him!\nstudent: Right. That was what I thought AFTER I had sent you the message\nteacher: Haha, they all call in Ukraine, don't they? Thank God, they don't here, but, on the downside, we take parcels for neighbours too\nteacher: Yes, you agree then?\nstudent: Oh yes they still call!!!\nstudent: And I'm a fan of chats\nstudent: I agree 100 percent\nteacher: Cool!\nteacher: Re: egg hunt :. I use a mixture of real painted Easter eggs and chocolate eggs, but I think a lot of the time people just use chocolate eggs. But the amount of chocolate consumed at Easter horrifies me!\nteacher: But there's always a big chocolate Easter egg at the end of the hunt :.\nstudent: I see. And how do you organise it? Is there a system?\nstudent: I'll probably colour the quail eggs for Sophia\nstudent: She can't have chocolate. Not yet..\nteacher: I just hide eggs around the garden! You can also buy an egg hunt kit, with clues and arrows\nstudent: Although she's keen on tasting it\nteacher: Haha, yes, hold that fort while you can! :.\nstudent: I try! And it's hard because I love chocolate so very much...\nstudent: And eat it often... hiding in the dark corners of our 45 square m apartment\nstudent: haha\nteacher: What's your favourite type?\nteacher: Haha, sneaky :....\nstudent: Ritter Sport 55% cocoa\nteacher: You're spoilt with the choice of chocolate and sweets in Ukraine, though. I miss them so!\nstudent: Isn't it even better in England?\nteacher: Ooh, yes, Ritter is excellent! And such clever marketing to call it 'sport' when it's got nothing to do with sport....\nteacher: Nooo! I don't think so! Well, unless you like licorice and hariboes\nteacher: and jelly beans\nstudent: Clever people indeed. That 55-one had only 4 ingredients but the taste is like no other. For me at least\nteacher: Lots of sweets are kind of Haribo-type. As opposed to magnificent Ukrainian sweets, including zefir and pastila :...\nstudent: Neither of the three\nteacher: I've got to try that one! I always go for the one with hazelnuts\nstudent: You should. It's ideal for sweet teeth .?. like me. I don't like dark chocolate and milk chocolate is too sweet\nstudent: This Ritter strikes a perfect balance\nteacher: But then, I think a lot of it is nostalgia. English people love their sweets because it's the taste of childhood, the same way we love zefir and 'marmelad', which is nothing like English marmelade, which is a type of jam :.\nteacher: I see! I'm not sure 'sweet tooth' can be used in the plural, but it makes sense!\nstudent: I agree. It's all about nostalgia\nstudent: sweet tooths then?\nteacher: I don't know.... it's got to be sweet teeth, right?\nstudent: or no plural at all graphically?\nteacher: we can just go for 'a sweet tooth like I am'\nstudent: We just imply it then... Maybe\nstudent: Is 'like me' incorrect by the way?\nteacher: No, it's absolutely fine!\nstudent: Thank you\nteacher: Ok, I've got more 'Tom said' jokes for you! a bit of fun before the holiday\nstudent: Yes please\nteacher: But please let me know if we did any of them last time. I've been doing them with my other C2 student and stupidly forgot to mark which of you has seen which jokes\nteacher: and now I can't remember!\nstudent: No problem\nstudent: For me it will probably be like the first time haha\nteacher: Ha, for me as well, that's the problem :.\nstudent: I remember 'listless'!\nteacher: Ah, I know, we've done 'crabbily', 'with wanton disregard', 'listless' and 'with relish'\nstudent: Yes!\nteacher: Sure!\nteacher: \u2022 \u201cThere\u2019s no more room in the hay barn,\u201d said Tom balefully.\nstudent: See how good your memory is\nteacher: I've probably missed some :.\nstudent: Balefully -- dunno\nteacher: Well, it's to do with 'a hay bale'\nteacher: You know, when combine harvesters stack hay in bales? Cubes or cylinders\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: but also, baleful = threatening to do something bad or to hurt someone\nteacher: He gave me a baleful look\nstudent: You might not believe it but it's a new word for me\nteacher: baleful = menacing\nstudent: Now Christian Bale's name will never be the same\nteacher: It's not a terribly high frequency word!\nteacher: Haha, it makes sense though, if you imagine his Batman voice :....\nstudent: ahaha\nstudent: A good one\nteacher: There's a joke somewhere here... 'You won't like this', Christian said balefully\nteacher: Ok, now here's a silly one!\nteacher: \u2022 'Baa,' said Tom sheepishly.\nstudent: ahaha\nstudent: OK. So sheepishly as sheep and the other one - foolishly ?\nteacher: sheepish = embarrassed because you know that you have done something wrong or silly\nteacher: from Cambridge English Dictionary\nstudent: Got it\nteacher: She gave him a sheepish look and apologized\nteacher: But, you know when in Russian we say 'I'm like a monkey' when we do something exactly like another person\nteacher: For example, you go to a shop and buy Ritter Sport, and I see you do it and copy you\nteacher: We say, like a monkey, don't we?\nteacher: I'm starting to doubt that...\nstudent: So they think more about the sheep in that context?\nstudent: More like a parrot maybe?\nteacher: Yes, they say, I'm being a sheep\nteacher: For example, if David orders something at a restaurant, I can say, 'Oh, I'll just be a sheep' and order exactly the same thing\nteacher: Because sheep are easily led apparently..\nstudent: Cool\nstudent: I'm going to use this one\nteacher: Yes, it's a good one!\nstudent: from now on\nstudent: Yes. I like it\nteacher: Ok! \u2022 'I have no flowers,' Tom said lackadaisically.\nstudent: OK. I only get the first part .as I usually do.. The lack of something indicating scarcity\nteacher: Oh, it's so silly. it's a lack of daisies in this case :.\nteacher: But 'lackadaisical' really means lazy and slow\nteacher: The food was nice enough but the service was somewhat lackadaisical.\nstudent: Wow\nteacher: /\u02ccl\u00e6k.\u0259\u02c8de\u026a.z\u026a.k\u0259l/'\nteacher: Yes, it's quite a word!\nstudent: Who came up with this word I wonder\nstudent: Someone in an enormous need of daises I suppose...\nteacher: I know! :..\nteacher: lackadaisical = half-hearted\nteacher: a good one to describe the service in many food places!\nstudent: Oh yes. I know just the place\nstudent: And not one\nteacher: Yes!\nteacher: Ok, one last!\nteacher: \u2022 'I'm wearing a ribbon around my arm,' said Tom with abandon.\nstudent: No clue\nteacher: It's just a play on words. with a band on\nteacher: as in with a ribbon around his arm...\nstudent: Oh.. Right!\nteacher: But you know 'with abandon' as in 'in an uncontrolled way'?\nteacher: We danced / sang / partied with abandon\nteacher: abandoning all caution, so to say\nstudent: Where does the stress fall?\nstudent: In abandon\nteacher: abAndon\nteacher: on the second syllable\nstudent: Got it\nstudent: Thank you\nstudent: aBAAAAndon -- I'm being a sheep\nteacher: Ok, so we've got 'baleful' .thanks for the image of Christian Bale, I'll never forget., sheepish, lackadaisical and with abandon\nteacher: Haha, yes!\nteacher: she said sheepishly\nteacher: Ok, I'll speak to you on Monday 12 April, ok?\nteacher: I'll send you a reminder though :.\nstudent: Let's maybe discuss closer to the date\nstudent: Thank you very much for the lesson\nstudent: Have a great Easter!\nteacher: It's a pleasure! Yes, definitely, we'll discuss!\nteacher: Thanks! I would say 'you too' but yours isn't until May!\nstudent: Right. We'll wait..\nteacher: Take care, bye :.\nstudent: See you!\nstudent: Bye",
    "teacher: Hi Emily Smith!\nteacher: Sorry, I'm here now\nstudent: Hi Ms. Roberts.! .\nstudent: No worries! .\nstudent: How are you?\nteacher: Thanks :.\nteacher: Good, thank you! I'm doing a bit of DIY before Ethan's holiday\nstudent: Actually how was your birthday? .\nstudent: DIY\nteacher: Do you know 'DIY'?\nstudent: Let me think .\nstudent: I saw it many times I think\nstudent: But I don't remember .\nteacher: It stands for 'do it yourself'. Any kind of decorating / renovating/ building people do themselves, without paying anyone\nteacher: I'm painting the bathroom myself, unprofessionally :. for example\nstudent: I see\nteacher: I had a lovely day on my birthday, thank you!\nstudent: Wow! You are so talented at those things\nteacher: We couldn't do very much because we're still locked down, but it was still lovely\nteacher: Haha, no, I just try to do my best\nstudent: Did you have a birthday cake? .\nstudent: And presents? ..\nstudent: and\nteacher: Yes! Chocolate layers with chocolate cream between them and chocolate icing on top :.\nteacher: And some lovely presents, yes! Everyone\nteacher: sorry\nteacher: Everyone's been giving me books :.\nstudent: wow! If I am not mistaken it was a chocolate cake ...\nteacher: Definitely :....\nstudent: haha! A book is the best present you know ...\nteacher: Exactly!\nstudent: And what kind of books were they?\nteacher: And how are you? Are you having another busy Friday?\nstudent: Some professional books or just usual books? .\nstudent: hudozhestvennaya literatura .\nteacher: Mr. David Brown gave me a book called 'The Song of Achilles' by Madeline Miller\nteacher: fiction!\nteacher: hudozhestvennaya literatura is fiction :.\nteacher: Novels, poetry - all kinds of made up stories\nstudent: Oh! I was meant to, but when I started my yoga it seemed like we didn't have a lesson today\nstudent: My teacher sent me a message because she noticed that someone (me) used a program for the yoga lesson\nteacher: As opposed to 'non-fiction' .memoirs, history books, science books etc..\nstudent: She said that she warned us before but maybe I missed it .\nteacher: Oh no, that must have been disappointing for you!\nteacher: How's it going with your marketing campaign?\nstudent: A bit. But you know everyone likes it when the teacher cancels a lesson ..\nstudent: We are working on it . And today I think we will launch our video on youtube\nstudent: We have a promo now\nstudent: And the first lesson\nteacher: Haha, yes, everyone's secretly pleased when a class gets cancelled\nteacher: Nice! Good luck with that!\nstudent: then I'm going to post a link to the telegram group where we are chatting with other students from our marketing course\nstudent: There are about 1500 members\nteacher: You're going to post?\nstudent: I think it will be good if they watch the video ..\nteacher: Ah, sure, you never know who might know someone who needs Russian classes :.\nstudent: to post, yes. No launch with this thing?\nstudent: I mean now we just need to promote the channel\nteacher: Hmm, if you're posting a link to a group / social media, the verb is to 'post'\nstudent: We don't need exactly expats\nteacher: But you can 'launch a marketing campaign' for example, 'launch a new course' or something like that\nteacher: launch a rocket into space :.\nstudent: And actually now we have several husbands of girls from the course as our potential students .\nteacher: Nice!!\nstudent: launch a rocket into space :.  - I see, thank you .\nstudent: And Ms. Roberts.\nstudent: About your present\nstudent: I haven't heard about that book\nstudent: Is it fiction? Or non-fiction?\nteacher: Good question! It's fiction! It's the story from the Iliad, but re-written\nteacher: Do you prefer to read fiction or non-fiction?\nstudent: Ah! Interesting. Did you ask Mr. David Brown for this book as a gift? .\nteacher: No, he just thought I might like it, and I think I will. I haven't started on it yet\nstudent: I think I prefer non-fiction, but fiction is my kind of books too\nstudent: Actually, I can't answer the question exactly .\nteacher: I know, it's a tricky question! Because they are so different, fiction and non-fiction\nstudent: I see .\nteacher: It's like asking whether you prefer cheese or tea\nteacher: Oh, speaking of marketing! A nice expression for you: 'word of mouth' Do you know this one? It's a powerful marketing tool\nstudent: I know\nstudent: Actually it's the only type of advertising we have now ...\nteacher: Haha, it's the best one!\nstudent: Cheese or tea or mum or dad .\nstudent: sarafannoe radio ..\nteacher: Yes! Do people still ask that in Ukraine? Who do you love more, your mummy or your daddy?\nteacher: exactly\nstudent: I think no. It's the worst question in the whole world I think .\nstudent: \u0435\u0440\u0443 \u0446\u0449\u043a\u044b\u0435\nstudent: the worst .\nstudent: sorry\nteacher: Definitely!\nstudent: Ah! I know another one\nstudent: When are you going to have a baby? .\nteacher: Yes! Well, it depends on your age. First people start with 'who do you love more?', then 'have you got anyone special?', then 'when are you getting married?', then baby, then another baby\nstudent: Yes!\nstudent: Thank God I didn't hear these questions from my relatives\nteacher: And then, is your child walking / talking / starting school / going to university yet :....\nteacher: It never stops!\nstudent: hahaha\nstudent: You are right .\nteacher: Ok, shall we have a look at some of the words from Alexa's interview then?\nstudent: Yes, we shall .\nstudent: shall\nteacher: Ok, cool!\nstudent: we are not a shell ...\nteacher: Ok, one of the very interesting words on your list was 'commit' .a verb.\nteacher: Alexa says she fully committed to setting up her own company\nstudent: I know commit a crime\nteacher: Yes, exactly! commit something illegal is the first meaning\nteacher: commit a crime / adultery / murder\nstudent: I see\nteacher: But also, if you commit to someone / something, you decide / promise to give your time and energy to this .and be loyal to this person.\nstudent: Ok!\nteacher: For example, both partners in a couple need to commit to the relationship\nstudent: I see\nteacher: the noun is 'commitment'\nteacher: Some people .often men. are described as commitment-phobiacs\nteacher: Can you guess what it means?\nstudent: no\nteacher: phobia = a fear of something\nstudent: Ok\nstudent: Ok\nstudent: I see\nteacher: Yes, they are afraid to commit to a relationship\nteacher: commit TO\nstudent: I mean I have an idea\nstudent: But I didn't hear about this type of phobia in Russian .\nstudent: I've checked it now .\nteacher: Yeah, I don't think there is a Russian equivalent!\nstudent: commit TO, ok .\nteacher: Ok, lovely\nteacher: Oh, I was pleased when Alexa was talking about 'mixing the masculine and feminine vibes' because we talked about the words masculine and feminine before, didn't we?\nstudent: Yes, we did\nstudent: I thought she was talking about fashion, wasn't she?\nstudent: I mean about the style of her clothes\nstudent: Maybe I was wrong\nteacher: Yes, exactly!\nteacher: She was\nstudent: Ah, ok .\nteacher: I like this style, actually, because the 'masculine vibe' usually makes clothes more comfortable :.\nstudent: And I think women look great in 'men's clothes'\nstudent: woman\nteacher: Yes, definitely! They have more structure, in a way\nteacher: Ok, an interesting expression was 'an imposter syndrome'\nstudent: Actually, I like trousers and blazers so much\nteacher: I think everyone who starts doing something new feels a bit of an imposter syndrome\nstudent: Ok! I know this syndrome\nstudent: ...\nstudent: I mean the expression and the feelings ...\nteacher: Yes, me too! I think everyone does :.\nstudent: haha\nteacher: Ok, and she kept repeating that a fashion business is not for the faint-hearted\nteacher: Do you know 'faint-hearted'?\nstudent: no\nteacher: #ERROR!\nteacher: faint = weak\nteacher: and the expression is often 'not for the faint-hearted'\nteacher: Travelling around the world is not for the faint-hearted\nteacher: Running your own business is not for the faint-hearted\nstudent: Aha, I see\nteacher: Yes, would you agree with that? About running your own business .fashion or not.\nstudent: I think yes\nteacher: Why? :.\nstudent: It looks like fun but you have to overcome lots of doubts and obstacles .\nteacher: Yes, I can imagine!\nstudent: And you have a huge responsibility .\nteacher: a very good expression - 'overcome'\nteacher: Oh, when you hire people?\nstudent: Thank you I've googled it . Sorry .\nstudent: googled\nteacher: no problem!\nstudent: Yes, but not just that. You have responsibilities to your clients too\nstudent: too\nteacher: Yes, sure! I've forgotten about that :...\nstudent: haha ..\nteacher: clients, so easy to forget! :...\nstudent: hahaha\nstudent: You are right!\nteacher: Yes, it's definitely not for the faint-hearted, running a business!\nstudent: Sometimes I feel like a business forgets about me as a client .\nteacher: Alexa was also talking a lot about the importance of delegating\nstudent: I like the statement\nteacher: Yes, it\nteacher: sorry\nteacher: it's a weird feeling\nstudent: It's one of the most important things for an owner of a business\nteacher: Ok, sure, you know all about it then!\nteacher: the expressions she uses are 'delegating' vs. 'micro-managing'\nstudent: Because you feel like you have to do it yourself because you know the best way to do it\nteacher: Are they both familiar to you?\nstudent: But then you can't concentrate on the things that are like under the routine\nteacher: Yes, on the big decisions you mean?\nstudent: yes, actually micro-managing can be called like a routine\nteacher: Hmm, usually 'micro-managing' means telling people what to do at every step, without leaving them any freedom\nstudent: Yes, I mean some strategic things\nteacher: Yes, got that!\nteacher: If a manager is micro-managing, they show that they don't trust employees to do things well in their own way and don't give them any autonomy\nteacher: And it takes a lot of time and energy, of course\nstudent: Ah!\nstudent: Actually I forgot to mention it\nteacher: Oops, I've just checked, and there is no hyphen, sorry! 'micromanage' as one word\nteacher: The head teacher shouldn't try to micromanage what happens in every classroom\nteacher: an example from the dictionary\nstudent: If you would like to delegate you have to be confident in your team\nstudent: Aha, thank you!\nteacher: Yes, exactly!\nteacher: Ah, I've got to let you go! We can revise the words on Monday, and talk about hot cross buns! :.\nstudent: Sure!\nstudent: thank you\nteacher: My pleasure :. Have a lovely weekend!\nstudent: You too! xx\nteacher: Bye :.",
    "student: Hi! How are you ?:]\nteacher: Hi Jessica Johnson!\nteacher: I'm good, thank you!\nteacher: How are you? How's your holiday going?\nstudent: It finished yesterday! Our holiday started last Thursday, and it finished yesterday\nteacher: Oh no! I see!\nteacher: Are schools still open despite the lockdown?\nstudent: And we are online because of the lockdown\nteacher: Ah, ok! Your favourite :.\nteacher: In this case, did you have a good holiday?\nstudent: Not really\nstudent: Boring\nteacher: Oh no, that's a shame!\nteacher: What did you do?\nstudent: I only went to my grandma\u2019s house for three days and that\u2019s all\nteacher: I see! Well, did you manage to chill? read, listen to some music, talk to your friends?\nstudent: Well, yes, but no.\nteacher: that's a very mysterious answer :.\nstudent: Heh\nteacher: Ok, I've got some oompa-loompa words for you, from our last class\nteacher: greedy, nincompoop, rot and clutter up\nteacher: Could you identify which one is which part of speech, please? .nouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives etc..\nstudent: Adjectives\nteacher: All of them?\nteacher: Hint: there's only one adjective\nstudent: No\nstudent: Wait\nstudent: t\nteacher: waiting :.\nstudent: Rot is a verb\nteacher: correct!\nstudent: Clutter up is also a verb\nteacher: Also correct!\nstudent: Greedy is an adjective\nteacher: yes\nstudent: And nincompoop is a noun\nteacher: Absolutely!\nteacher: The fruit I bought ___ before I could eat them! Such a shame! .which word goes in the gap?.\nstudent: Rot\nteacher: Ok, but it's in the past, isn't it?\nstudent: Rotten\nteacher: rotted\nteacher: But 'rotten' is an adjective. rotten fruit\nstudent: Yeah\nteacher: It's a regular verb\nteacher: Ok, cool\nteacher: I ate the whole cake in secret and didn't share, and then my family called me ____\nstudent: Greedy\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: The government has just done something extremely stupid. What a bunch of ______!\nstudent: Nincompoop\nteacher: nincompoops .plural, right.\nteacher: ?\nteacher: But yes.\nteacher: Aaaand, can you give me an example with 'clutter up', please?\nstudent: When I came in, I saw that the house was cluttered up with rubbish\nteacher: Yes, correct!\nteacher: There's also a verb 'to declutter', it means to get rid of all the clutter you have collected\nteacher: Have you heard of Marie Kondo? She teaches people how to declutter\nstudent: No\nteacher: Well, she had her own TV show .or maybe it's still going, I'm not sure.. She comes to people's houses and helps them to get rid of stuff\nteacher: Are you a tidy person? Are things always in their places? Or does your room get cluttered up? .Mine does!.\nstudent: Usually when I am tired some things are not in their places, but then I put them away\nteacher: Ah, I admire that! It's hard for me to keep things tidy\nteacher: I like to be surrounded by things that I like. At the moment, it's books, seed packets and cards. But they do clutter up the place!\nteacher: Ok, today I'd like us to talk about a trial that took place in one of English nurseries. .are their any unfamiliar words in this sentence?.\nstudent: Trial and nurseries\nteacher: Sure!\nteacher: a trial = an experiment that takes place over some time\nteacher: For example, scientists want to find out how some things are going to work, and they run a trial to see what the results will be\nteacher: a new vaccine / medicine needs to go through clinical trials .when it's tested on volunteers, for example.\nteacher: and a nursery is a place where children spend their days while their parents are at work\nteacher: Did you go the nursery before you started school?\nstudent: Yea\nteacher: Did you like it? Were there a lot of toys?\nstudent: Yes I think\nteacher: Ok, cool! Well, in this trial, they removed all toys from a nursery and gave children some objects like magnets and bits of metal instead\nteacher: Also, some shells, boxes and envelopes\nteacher: Do you think the children at this nursery enjoyed them? Or do you think they missed their toys?\nteacher: You'll watch a video to find out in a minute :.\nteacher: Are you with me, Jessica Johnson?.\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: Ok, what do you think then?\nstudent: I didn\u2019t watch the video\nstudent: You didn\u2019t send it\nteacher: I know, I'm just wondering what you think! If all toys were taken away from a nursery, and children had objects that I've just described to play with, would they enjoy it? Or would they miss their toys?\nstudent: I think some of them would miss the toys and some of them not\nteacher: Haha, a wise answer\nteacher: Ok, let's see!\nstudent: Like children are different\nteacher: I've sent you the link now\nstudent: I watched\nteacher: Ok, so what happened? How did the kids react?\nstudent: The youngest children were okay with it\nstudent: But older ones asked for their toys back\nteacher: Yes, in the end they missed their trains, didn't they?\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: Why did scientists want to run this trial? to remove toys\nstudent: To teach dexterity and to reinforce gender through the toys\nteacher: Aha, interesting!\nteacher: They were saying that toys like princesses and superheroes reinforce gender stereotypes\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: gender = roles associated with being male / female\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: And they wanted to avoid gender stereotypes, not reinforce them actually\nstudent: I meant stereotype\nteacher: reinforce = make something stronger\nstudent: Oops\nteacher: No worries, good try!\nstudent: That's what they said in the video\nteacher: Ok, we'll talk about it more next time, ok?\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: Oh, speaking of next time! I will take a couple of weeks off .it's Easter holidays here!., and our next class will be\nteacher: one sec, I'm loading my calendar, but it's being slow!\nteacher: Got it! Friday April 16th, ok?\nstudent: Ok\nstudent: That\u2019s long\nteacher: Yes, my son will have two weeks off school\nteacher: I know in Ukraine spring holidays are only one week, aren't they?\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: Yes, they are two weeks here .but the summer holidays are only 6 weeks!.\nstudent: Why?\nteacher: Just a tradition I suppose. The academic year is different in the UK!\nteacher: Ok, I'll send you a reminder about the class when I'm back at work. Have a good weekend, speak to you in April!\nstudent: Okay, goodbye !\nteacher: Bye! :.",
    "student: Hi there .\nteacher: Hiya!\nteacher: How are you this morning?\nstudent: Fine, thank you\nstudent: No pilates unfortunately\nteacher: Oh no, why not?\nstudent: I haven't had pilates today ..\nstudent: Maybe you know there's a lockdown in France too\nstudent: So my fitness teacher doesn't have a nanny now and she couldn't do the lesson\nstudent: Because of her little daughter\nteacher: Oh yes, it seems Europe including Ukraine is where the UK was in January :.\nstudent: Sometimes she can ask her mom to be with the daughter but not today\nstudent: So she cancelled\nteacher: Right, I see! Are there going to be any classes at all?\nteacher: Have you ever tried Youtube yoga classes?\nstudent: No, no, she will try to manage it, and she even did last week, but today it .vyiavylos. too hard\nstudent: I've never tried, I'm not such a self-disciplined person . And I like to have feedback\nteacher: it proved too hard, sure\nteacher: Yes, makes sense! You're a very self-disciplined person!\nstudent: It was a Ukrainian word . Sorry, maybe I confused you a bit\nteacher: vyiavylos?\nteacher: No, I understand!\nstudent: Haha, sometimes maybe, but not when we talk about sport ..\nteacher: Fair enough!\nteacher: Today's a big day for the UK because Prince Harry is coming back\nstudent: But today I had a little walk about 40 mins from my home to the office\nstudent: the weather is nice\nteacher: I'm joking, because shops and pubs are reopening!\nstudent: And there aren't lots of people on the street\nstudent: hahaha\nteacher: Oh, that's good! People must be following the rules then\nteacher: But Prince Harry is coming back too, for his grandfather's funeral\nstudent: Yeah, it's a sad reason for Harry to be there again\nteacher: Yes, true! And now the newspapers are discussing what a horrible person Meghan is for not coming, but she is very pregnant and shouldn't be flying, especially during the pandemic\nstudent: ok! Shops and pubs are reopening! Are you going to go shopping or to a cafe or have you decided not to hurry?\nteacher: Oh, sorry, I should have said. Only 'beer gardens' have re-opened, the outside areas in pubs\nstudent: Oh! Agree, it's too dangerous for her and for the baby. But I think it's a good .\u0441\u043e\u0432\u043f\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435. for her too .\nteacher: No, I'm not planning to go anywhere! I'm just shopping online. But I'm very looking forward to have a haircut at last!\nteacher: Yes, it's a coincidence\nstudent: Do you know what kind of haircut you would like?\nteacher: Oh, the same, just 3 inches shorter!\nteacher: What's that? about 7-8 cm, but you've got to be able to say it in inches at hairdresser's here\nstudent: So, no new red color or something else? ...\nteacher: No, nothing radical! :...\nteacher: I like my hair low-maintenance :.\nstudent: ok . I don't like experiments with my hair either\nteacher: Do you know 'maintenance'?\nteacher: Neither do I!\nstudent: I know there is a kind of women who like to face new periods of their life with a new hairstyle\nstudent: But I don't .\nstudent: No, I don't know the expression\nteacher: And if you start dyeing your hair, you have to do it regularly. The verb is 'dye' .dyeing; dyed.\nteacher: to dye your hair = to change its colour\nteacher: e.g. She dyed her hair red\nteacher: Sorry, back to maintenance!\nteacher: /\u02c8me\u026an.t\u0259n.\u0259ns/\nteacher: the work you need to do to keep something in good condition\nteacher: for example, car maintenance, house maintenance, road maintenance\nstudent: Ah! Sure! About to dye\nstudent: like \u0443\u0445\u0430\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c? \u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044c?\nteacher: Yes!\nteacher: Something can be 'high maintenance' or 'low maintenance'\nteacher: For example, an old car might be quite high maintenance because you have to take it to a mechanic a lot\nteacher: or an old house\nteacher: A short haircut and dyed hair is high maintenance because you have to go to the hairdresser's every 4 weeks!\nstudent: \u0428 \u044b\u0443\u0443\nteacher: But 'maintenance' is a noun, by the way\nstudent: sorry .\nstudent: I see\nteacher: The verb is to 'maintain'\nstudent: Ok, so my hair is low maintenance .\nteacher: /me\u026an\u02c8te\u026an/\nteacher: Yes, mine too! That's the way I like it :.\nstudent: I don't dye it and don't cut it .....\nstudent: but mine is extremely low maintenance ..\nstudent: Ok, but you know\nteacher: Yes, well done with the correct pronoun! hair = it\nstudent: now I have some white hair\nteacher: Ah, me too! it's 'grey hair' in English\nstudent: And I have to do something with it I think\nteacher: Annoying!\nstudent: Ah! Ok! I remember that it's something different in English ..\nstudent: So&lt; I have grey hair\nteacher: Well, you have your lovely sister-in-law to consult with :.\nstudent: I like women who don't dye it\nstudent: But I think it doesn't look as cool on me\nstudent: .\nteacher: Yes, it's brave, not to dye it! But I'm like you, not sure about myself :.\nstudent: She actually dyed my hair about 2 months ago\nstudent: But the .\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043a\u0430. was like very healthy and not too strong\nteacher: Ok, I see! The hair dye\nstudent: So it looked like the grey hair became less grey but not totally dyed? .\nstudent: sorry dyed?\nteacher: Yes, the grey hair became less grey, makes sense!\nstudent: But it was ok, the color was so natural like my real hair\nteacher: Ah, it's nice to have a hair stylist in the family! :.\nstudent: And I like that two months ago it looks like before but not like I have to run to the hairdresser's ..\nteacher: Sounds perfect!\nteacher: and low maintenance :.\nstudent: But now my grey hair became 100% grey again . And I don't like it ...\nstudent: Sorry for the long story about my grey hair ..\nteacher: No, I hear you! I'm at the beginning of this journey myself...\nteacher: By the way, 'high maintenance' can be a way to describe a person. Not a very nice way!\nteacher: If you need to do a lot of emotional work to get on with a person, they are probably high maintenance'\nstudent: Ah, I see\nstudent: Let me think\nstudent: we have an expression in Russian\nstudent: Ah! Toxic people .\nteacher: Financially, too. If a wife is used to a certain level of luxury, and the husband has to provide it .a stereotype.\nteacher: Hmm, I think it's a bit different from a 'toxic' person, even though they can go together\nteacher: Toxic' is also a way to describe a person in English!\nstudent: Aha, so toxic is a bigger problem\nteacher: Well, toxic describes a negative effect a person has on others\nstudent: Ah, I see what you mean\nstudent: Like it's two different ways to describe a person\nstudent: methods\nteacher: But a 'high maintenance' person requires a lot of attention, money etc.\nstudent: I see, thank you\nstudent: could a baby be high maintenance?\nteacher: Yes, it can be about one and the same .unpleasant. person\nteacher: I've just been thinking about that. All babies are high maintenance by definition, aren't they? :.\nteacher: But a way to describe a 'fussy' baby, who cries a lot, is 'high-need'\nstudent: Agree! But I mean if it is ok to use the expression when I talk about babies? .\nstudent: Oh, fussy\nstudent: I haven't heard the word before\nteacher: Well, 'high maintenance' is quite negative. Fussy goes well with 'baby', and 'high-need'\nstudent: But you know it looks like the name of one Ukrainian musician .\nteacher: No, which one?\nstudent: but I think he's fozzy\nteacher: Haha, I see! I didn't know that\nstudent: You know he band TNMK?\nteacher: Yes, I do!\nstudent: So one of them is Fogod and the other is Fozzy\nstudent: they're not their real names ..\nstudent: I don't know what to call it in English .\nteacher: Their stage names!\nstudent: \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0449\u0435, \u043f\u0441\u0435\u0432\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043c, \u043a\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043a\u0430 .\nteacher: Actors and musicians have stage names\nteacher: And writers have pen names :.\nstudent: Aha! So these are their stage names .\nstudent: Oh, it's nice .\nteacher: Nice and easy :.\nteacher: There's also the word 'pseudonym'\nteacher: /\u02c8sju\u02d0.d\u0259.n\u026am/\nteacher: you don't pronounce the 'p'\nteacher: like in 'psychology'\nstudent: Ok! Thank you\nstudent: But it's more formal?\nteacher: Yes!\nteacher: But it's easy for you because it's like in Russian :. except for the pronunciation\nstudent: I see\nstudent: Actually\nstudent: Is it Liam's first day at school after the holiday?\nstudent: Is it .\nteacher: Yes! He's back at school. He was looking forward to it!\nstudent: Oh! It's so good\nstudent: I didn't like school .\nteacher: Also, the school has changed their catering company, and their new lunch menu looks amazing!\nstudent: more healthy?\nteacher: You didn't like school when you were small?\nteacher: Well, not necessarily more healthy :. He's having a hot dog today and a pizza tomorrow... But it sounds so good! And the desserts too\nstudent: Is Jamie Oliver cooking for them?\nstudent: I like hot dogs ..\nteacher: They have an Italian day, a Mexican day, a British day, and a Middle Eastern day. Very cool!\nstudent: But I don't eat them very often .\nteacher: Haha, I think his days of cooking school dinners are well past him!\nstudent: Oh! Wow! It's a cool idea!\nteacher: It is, isn't it?\nstudent: Actually\nteacher: The menu looks really nice, I just hope the food will be nice too\nstudent: Last Friday we ordered two burgers and some fried mozzarella .\nteacher: You've making me hungry now!\nstudent: Liam tried all the food and she liked it .....\nteacher: Good! Does she like fries?\nstudent: She's never eaten them. tsss.. .\nstudent: we ordered just the burgers without fries ..\nteacher: Haha, I see! Liam loves fries from KFC :.\nstudent: Foxy parents ..\nteacher: Haha, yes!\nstudent: And when she was trying the burger she was asking me about a hot dog\nstudent: so it's our next goal\nstudent: to order hot dogs ..\nteacher: I love a good hot dog, and so does Liam!\nstudent: We have a special restaurant here in Kyiv\nstudent: Kyiv\nstudent: It's called Dogs and Tails\nteacher: I keep reading about some cool food delivery company in Kyiv, that makes mini-burgers\nteacher: It ___ called Dogs and Tails\nstudent: The price is quite big but the quality is good\nstudent: It is called\nstudent: is\nteacher: Yes!\nstudent: Of course .\nteacher: And the question is: ____ is it called?   - Dogs and Tails\nstudent: They have lots of types of sausages and hot dogs\nstudent: What is it called?\nteacher: What is it called?\nstudent: I feel hungry too now ..\nteacher: It's a bit hard to get used to for speakers of Russian\nstudent: Ah! I thought it could be what\nstudent: ..\nteacher: Yes, that was a good thought :.\nstudent: So what is it called?\nteacher: Yes!\nteacher: And the indirect question?\nteacher: I don't know ___ ___ ___ called.\nstudent: What it is called\nteacher: Yes! Sorry, it's not an indirect question. An indirect one would be 'Could you tell me what it is called?' , but the grammar is the same\nteacher: Ok, I've got to let you go! We'll do the new topic with the videos on Friday then!\nstudent: I see! No worries\nstudent: Thank you! It was pleasant to chat with you as usual .\nstudent: Have a good afternoon\nteacher: Today's new words: to dye .dyeing, dyed., high / low maintenance, a coincidence... hmmm, there was something else!\nteacher: Thank you, it's my pleasure :.\nstudent: I will look through the chat .\nstudent: bye xx\nteacher: Cool, have a nice afternoon too! Bye :.\nstudent: thank you!",
    "student: Emily Smith\nstudent: Emily Smith here...\nstudent: Hello Ms. Cooper!\nteacher: Hi Emily Smith! :.\nstudent: Sorry for being late\nstudent: This is what happens when you try to arrange your lunch in advance\nteacher: Haha, you know what song's been in my head all day? 'How do you solve a problem like Maria? How do you catch a cloud and pin it down?'\nteacher: from the Sound of Music\nstudent: You still wait for 2+ hours\nteacher: Don't worry!\nteacher: What did you have?\nstudent: I'm so pissed\nstudent: Really. Never heard that song\nteacher: Oh sorry, I can imagine! Super annoying!\nstudent: I'll google\nteacher: You should, it's lovely!\nstudent: Sounds lovely indeed\nteacher: It's Olivia's favourite\nstudent: Bless him!\nstudent: Did I use it correctly?\nteacher: It's when nuns in the convent try to decide what to do with Maria who is a bit too liverly for the setting :.\nteacher: yes, absolutely!\nteacher: He doesn't like 'lame girl stuff' anymore .school!., unless it's to do with Julie Andrews :..\nteacher: Sorry, lively!\nstudent: Haha. the song's about me.\nteacher: I think that's why it's been on my mind, it fits! :.\nstudent: Let me check if it's on Apple Music\nteacher: It will be :.\nteacher: How's life in general? Was your lunch worth waiting for?\nteacher: It might be called 'Maria'\nstudent: Maria by Julie Andrews?\nstudent: found it\nteacher: Maria from the Sound of Music, it's not actually her singing, it's about her :.\nstudent: She's always late for everything except for every meal\nstudent: So me\nstudent: haha\nteacher: Hahaha... careful, it's a proper earworm!\nstudent: I'm fine. It has been a busy weekend. Adam worked and I handled Ethan singlehandedly .........\nstudent: Such a lovely song\nteacher: Yes, doesn't sound very relaxing!\nstudent: Thank you!\nteacher: It is, isn't it? You're most welcome :.\nstudent: How are things with you? How was your Easter celebration?\nteacher: Good, thank you! I even made hot cross buns\nstudent: one-a-penny, two-a-penny\nteacher: We had a lovely but all-too-short spell of summery weather, and now we are back to winter!\nteacher: That's it :. I was too lazy and unreligious to make crosses on them, I'm afraid\nstudent: So buns without crosses then?\nteacher: Just hot buns, that's it....\nstudent: Hot bunsss -- even better\nteacher: That's it!\nstudent: Did you hunt the eggs?\nteacher: Did I tell you that Olivia attends a church school?\nstudent: No, you didn't. How does he find it?\nteacher: Olivia did! Easter bunny had paid a nice visit :.\nstudent: Attaboy!\nteacher: Well, there's an interesting system in the UK. Lots of schools are 'faith schools'\nteacher: In that they are state schools that teach the national curriculum, but they have some degree of affiliation with the church, I'm not entirely sure how it works\nstudent: I see.\nteacher: The church might run a trust that helps the school with the funding, for example, or the land might belong to the church\nstudent: Do they have any religious studies?\nteacher: Yes, they have a subject called 'religious education'\nteacher: Mind you, RE doesn't include much education about Islam or Buddhism, for example\nteacher: Annoyingly, church schools are often better!\nteacher: Which is supposed to be the case with Olivia's school .it's also the closest.\nteacher: It's still quite an alien concept to me, though\nstudent: Doesn't seem very fair to other religions, does it?\nstudent: Well. what can you do if it's better and the closest\nteacher: They do a lot for religious holidays too. Just before the lockdown, Olivia was talking a lot about baby Jesus being born, and when he went back after the lockdown, Jesus was about to die on the cross...\nstudent: It's 2 out of 3\nteacher: Yes, exactly!\nstudent: The life of Jesus. Lockdown edition\nteacher: Haha, that's it!....\nteacher: How's your lockdown going?\nstudent: Life has surely gotten more inconvenient\nstudent: Every day I need to think how to deliver our nanny to Ethan or Ethan to her nanny\nteacher: Oh, what a pain! Because taxis are in short supply?\nstudent: and super expensive..\nteacher: I know Samantha Reynolds said they use taxis for the nanny\nstudent: It's a pain really\nteacher: Goodness, yes!\nteacher: Does she live far away, the nanny?\nstudent: They have been using the taxis for almost a year now I think\nstudent: The nanny lives in Obolon\nstudent: which is bad even without the lockdown\nteacher: Right, yes!\nstudent: The fees are now up to 400 UAH per 7 km\nteacher: Oh my goodness, it's crazy! It used to be 200 UAH from Obolon where we lived to Borispol\nstudent: So we wait to get a better bargain. And as a result instead of starting her work at 10 am our nanny started at 11:30\nstudent: Some people argue there was a fare of 1000 to Borispol from Obolon\nstudent: Can you believe it!\nteacher: Wow, yes!\nteacher: Ah, tough! Hope it gets better soon for you guys!\nstudent: Thank you! I hope so too\nstudent: How is your lockdown going?\nteacher: Ok, could you please download the pdf I emailed you earlier today?\nstudent: Sure\nteacher: Oh, we're on to the next stage starting from today! Shops have re-opened after, hmmm, nearly 4 months I think!\nstudent: I have it\nstudent: Yay! Congratulations!\nteacher: As well as beer gardens in pubs and hairdressers\nstudent: Poor businesses\nteacher: Thank you :.\nstudent: It's such a shame\nstudent: Finally, a place for Liverpool fans to meet up...\nteacher: Well, yes, but there is a furlough scheme, employees received 80% of their wages\nteacher: Still, poor businesses!\nteacher: Why Liverpool fans? Have I missed another football event?\nstudent: People usually think if it's a business, you are swamped with money\nstudent: you are*\nstudent: And can sustain yourself forever\nteacher: Oh yes, it's been super tough!\nstudent: Not at all. I just heard they are crazy hardcore fans\nstudent: I have the book now\nteacher: Yes, I think there's a stereotype in Ukraine, because in the 90s businesses did better than the public sector\nstudent: What page should I go to?\nteacher: Cool! Could you go to page 14, please? You might have to rotate it\nstudent: Yes. I agree. it's more stereotypical of Ukraine\nstudent: Got it\nteacher: Soap operas?\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: Cool. You know what to do - a multiple choice :.\nstudent: yes\nstudent: let's do it\nstudent: 1. capturing\nstudent: Or should I write the letters?\nteacher: Either way! Letter are good\nteacher: 1. yes!\nstudent: 1. B\nstudent: 2. A\nstudent: 3. A\nteacher: Yes, keep going and then we'll have a look\nstudent: 4. A\nstudent: 5. B\nstudent: 6. D\nstudent: 7. B\nstudent: 8. C\nstudent: done\nteacher: All correct apart from 2 and 3! Could you look back and give me your second choice, please?\nteacher: for 2 and 3 I mean\nstudent: I knew it!\nstudent: one sec\nstudent: 2 established\nstudent: dismissed\nstudent: 3 dismissed -- which was what I originally wrote\nteacher: Dismissed - yes!\nteacher: and 2 is emerged\nteacher: emerge as a genre', 'emerge on the scene' etc.\nteacher: as in first appear\nstudent: right\nstudent: Understood\nteacher: I like the expression from the example, 'beyond dispute'!\nteacher: It's often 'beyond doubt', with 'beyond dispute' being quite low frequency, I would say\nteacher: Are there any expressions that caught your eye?\nstudent: A nice one to broaden your vocabulary!\nteacher: yes!\nstudent: tightly-knit neighbourhoods\nteacher: Yes, a good one! You can use 'tightly-knit' to describe an .extended. family or a team, too!\nstudent: I immediately thought of Santa Barbara and my grandma's viewing sessions with her girlfriends\nteacher: Haha, yes, I was telling Adam Smith. not so long ago about the 'babushkas on a bench' culture, and rushing home for the 5 pm soap :..\nstudent: Yes! That's it!\nstudent: Prosto Maria\nstudent: The rich cry too\nstudent: haha\nstudent: The Wild Rose\nteacher: Dinastiya!!\nstudent: hahaha\nteacher: Tropicanka!\nstudent: The jems\nteacher: We certainly seem to have graduated from similar childhoods :.\nteacher: Ok, have you got 5 minutes for the next task? Or shall I let you go?\nstudent: I've got 5 min yes\nteacher: Lovely! Part 2 then :.\nstudent: We certainly do....\nstudent: about a robot?\nteacher: Yes, that's the one!\nstudent: 9. enough\nstudent: 10. incapable\nstudent: 11. looming ?\nstudent: 12. themselves ?\nstudent: 13. with\nstudent: 14. extent\nstudent: 15. ahead\nstudent: 16. 16. giving\nstudent: that's it\nteacher: Yes, well done! except for 11 and 12, which are both prepositions :.\nstudent: Riiiiight\nstudent: 11. ON\nteacher: Yes...\nstudent: How could I....\nteacher: and make....\nstudent: up?\nteacher: I know, it was one of those you'd pick up when checking your answers, 11\nteacher: Yes! to up\nteacher: I mean, yes to 'up'\nstudent: Yay!\nteacher: Yay!\nteacher: Well done!\nstudent: Yes. I would have probably given it more thought at a real exam\nteacher: I sent you a link to where I get all these goodies from. I wonder if you'd like / will have the time to do a listening test\nstudent: Thank you Ms. Cooper!\nstudent: I can try\nteacher: You're very welcome, my pleasure :.\nteacher: No pressure!\nstudent: Let me know which listening task you'd like me to do\nteacher: Any of them! I think one is for the paper-based test and one for the computer-based one\nteacher: But they are the same lenght and level of difficulty\nstudent: Ok then. I'll choose and let you know\nstudent: Thanks again!\nstudent: choose\nteacher: There's an answer key, feel free to check yourself!\nstudent: OK\nstudent: See you next week!\nteacher: Ok, have a lovely week, I'll speak to you next Monday :.\nteacher: Bye :.\nstudent: You too!\nstudent: oops\nstudent: a glitch\nteacher: Haha, it's a special feature of this chatroom\nstudent: Imagine me shouting off the balcony\nstudent: You too!\nteacher: :... You toooo!\nstudent: Bye!\nteacher: Bye!",
    "student: Hi Mr. Parker! How are you?\nteacher: Hi Sophia Smith!\nteacher: Good, thank you! Good to be back to classes :.\nteacher: How are you? Did you have a nice Easter break?\nstudent: Good thank you! Yes, it was nice! We even managed to go out for some walks...\nstudent: now winter has come again, today it's even snowing...\nstudent: How about you?\nteacher: Ooh yes, us too! We had a spell of really summery weather for three days, and now we're back to winter too\nteacher: But we're enjoying our newly-found freedom to travel rather than 'stay at home'\nteacher: go on day trips, that is. We're not allowed to stay anywhere overnight\nteacher: Did you cook anything exciting? What's traditional Easter food in Italy?\nstudent: I have heard: that is so cool! I hope they will also lift some restrictions next month...\nstudent: In Italy we traditionally cook a lamb for Easter...or, in certain areas, they eat some sharks (which are called 'the lamb of the sea' in Italian).\nteacher: Yes, I hope the rest of Europe will ride out this wave very soon!\nstudent: We actually had more of a picnic outside with some friends!\nteacher: Sharks? Like actual sharks, the fish?\nstudent: Yes, there is a species called 'Verdesca' which we eat...\nteacher: It's a lamb roast in England too, traditinally. And hot cross buns\nstudent: but it is smaller than the white shark you are probably thinking of\nteacher: Wow, I'll look it up! I presume it lives in the Mediterranean?\nstudent: We also have a traditional cake, called 'colomba' (literally meaning 'dove')\nstudent: it is a sweet bread with icing which has a shape inspired by one of the doves\nstudent: Yes indeed\nteacher: My husband actually made an Italian lamb roast, stuffed with apricots and fennel. We also had some asparagus from the garden. Delicious!\nteacher: The English way is lamb roasted with rosemary and some mint sauce on the side\nstudent: That sounds like something quite tasty indeed :.\nteacher: And of course, Ukrainian Easter cakes are basically Italian panettone!\nstudent: Haha, I will have to try these cakes!\nstudent: I have just sent you the writing exercise .I finished it just before writing to you....\nteacher: Oh, yes, smaller sharks, I'm with you. Not something out of Jaws\nteacher: Aha, I was going to ask you about that. Thank you! How did you find it?\nteacher: I'll prepare and we can look at it next time if you don't mind .unless you'd really like some feedback straightaway.\nstudent: I didn't have much time to check it, so it probably isn't the most coherent letter you'll read in your life. That's okay!\nstudent: But one thing it is clear: it has been a long time since I wrote something like this, so it took me quite a while to write it...\nstudent: I guess I'll have to practise a bit more\nteacher: How long would you say it took you?\nstudent: 30 minutes\nstudent: maybe a bit less\nteacher: That's not bad at all! And you're within the word count?\nstudent: Yes, according to Office (I didn't have to count words, that would have taken 5 minutes). .\nteacher: You'd have about 45 minutes in the actual test\nstudent: Okay, good to know! Still, it felt like I was writing really slowly...\nteacher: Yes, good! re: word count\nstudent: The word count should be a bit shy of 300 words...\nteacher: Well, I must admit, C2 proficiency writing topics are not terribly exciting, so writing might seem like a bit of a painful process\nstudent: Haha, while I agree the topics weren't exicting, I wouldn't describe it as painful .\nteacher: It takes and looks like panettone!\nstudent: Okay, there is a problem in the chat I guess, you have to look for 'colomba di Pasqua'\nstudent: for some reason the page is cutting and pasting the website name...\nteacher: That looks really nice!\nteacher: No worries, I'm not sure why it happens in this chatroom!\nteacher: Ok, shall we have a look at a few more C2 practice test exercises? I sent you a pdf, could you download it, please?\nstudent: Yes, I just opened it!\nteacher: Great! Could you go to page 14, please? You might have to rotate it, depending on your screen\nstudent: Part 1 exercise\nstudent: right?\nteacher: Yes, that's right, the multiple choice one!\nstudent: 1. B, 2. B, 3 A .I'd chose it over D, but I am not sure., 4. A, 5. B, 6. D .?., 7. B, 8. C\nteacher: one moment\nstudent: of course!\nteacher: All correct, except for 3, which is D :.\nteacher: to dismiss something as something - a good structure\nstudent: to disregard something\nstudent: without the 'as something' part, right?\nteacher: Yes, exactly. The clue is in the 'as sth' part\nstudent: Okay, great thank you!\nteacher: And you weren't sure about 6?\nteacher: Ah, invariably!\nteacher: It's one of those hard-to-explain but high frequency expressions\nstudent: Indeed the other do not sound nice to me\nteacher: If we speak about soap operas, invariably, actors in long-running shows have to leave and writers have to find ways to explain their abscence\nteacher: something that happens all the time\nstudent: but I wasn't completely sure\nteacher: here we go again' meaning\nteacher: but 'invariably' is quite formal, as in you will find it in reputable newspapers etc.\nstudent: I see...now it is clearer...I was thinking that a simpler synonym could be 'always'...but the usage is slightly different\nstudent: and so I was thinking that the other words have a meaning 'close' to the one of 'always'\nteacher: It's more like 'forever' colloquially\nstudent: at least perpetually...I would have never chosen uniformly\nstudent: Anyway, I guess this confounded you. I agree that invariably is the best option :.\nteacher: Haha, I've just looked it up in Cambridge English Dictionary, and the definition is 'always .C2.'\nteacher: as in 'always' for proficient speakers\nteacher: Still, you wouldn't use 'invariably' on a daily basis in everyday speech\nstudent: Haha, okay ;. Anyway invariably also comes from Latin\nteacher: There\u2019s no point in rushing \u2013 she\u2019s invariably late. High blood pressure is almost invariably accompanied by high blood cholesterol.\nteacher: Yes, does it mean 'without a change'?\nstudent: I think so..to be honest in Italian there are two words with the same roots, one means 'without a change' .invariato/invariabile., the other is closer to the meaning of 'invariably' .invariabilmente.\nteacher: I see, interesting!\nteacher: By the way, the expression in the example .0. is a useful one: 'beyond dispute'\nteacher: We often hear 'beyond doubt', but 'beyond dispute' is a good one to remember too\nteacher: Ok, shall we move on to Part 2?\nstudent: The expression is similar to 'beyond question', right?\nstudent: Yes\nstudent: (if it is a common expression, now I am starting to doubt that)\nteacher: Yes, sure!\nteacher: That's a good trio. Beyond doubt / dispute / question\nstudent: (Finally something I know about: artificial intelligence)\nteacher: Haha, yes! It might be quite outdated, this book might have been published a few years ago\nstudent: 9. enough, 10. incapable, 11. on 12. .... 13. with 14. degree 15. on .?? I know this is a standard expression, but I am really unsure.,  16 giving\nstudent: I really don't know what to put in 12...and I am also not 100% sure about 16\nteacher: All correct except for 12 and 15\nteacher: 12 is 'up' for 'make up'\nstudent: ohhhh...\nteacher: Young people make up a quarter of the population...\nstudent: okay, I was trying to split the sentence\nteacher: Ah, I see! They were just looking for a phrasal verb!\nstudent: I thought it means something like 'as robots become more relevant in our society'\nteacher: I see, yes!\nteacher: 15 is either 'ahead' or 'forward'\nstudent: Instead it was more of a 'number' relevance, I see :.\nstudent: Oh...yes,\nteacher: Looking ahead, as in 'thinking about the future'\nstudent: I'll write that down\nteacher: Well done with 14 .a degree to which...., the other option is 'extent'\nstudent: I guess the 'further' distracted me from remembering this simple option...\nteacher: Ah yes, 'looking further ahead'\nstudent: Okay, I see 'extent' could have been an option :.\nteacher: Lovely, yes\nteacher: So where are you on the whole 'do/will robots feel?' question?\nstudent: That's a hard question...well, in short, while I believe a robot (or any electronic device really) should try to mimic certain human behaviours to make the user feel comfortable...I am not sure we will be able to give them 'real feelings' anytime soon\nstudent: Plus, robots with feelings pose ethical problems, so I don't think we need them, at least for now...\nteacher: Yes, definitely ethical problems!\nstudent: But still it is an interesting topic :. And certain things described here have come true, e.g., robots (or artificial intelligences in general) learning from what you do are a reality\nstudent: We just call that 'model personalization', and it is easy to do...what is difficult to do is to respect privacy...\nteacher: I find AI 'empathy' really annoying, actually. When I'm talking to a tech / customer support chatbot and keeps expressing empathy to me, this really winds me up!\nteacher: Which is why I doubt the success of apps like 'a therapist chatbot'\nstudent: Haha, I understand...I also hate it that they add a 'response time', because an immediate answer would make people feel uncomfortable\nstudent: (or make them think the answer is less good than the one obtained in less than one second)\nteacher: Ooh, I didn't know about a response time!\nteacher: Goodness, my eyes have been opened! and I feel cheated! :..\nstudent: At least with the chatbot of my bank, when you write, you see a 'chatbot is typing' thing and it can take even 10-15 seconds, I am sure most of it is just waiting time staged so that you feel like it is thinking\nstudent: *thinking\nteacher: Yes, because in reality it should be lightening fast, right?\nteacher: Sorry, lightning fast, no e\nstudent: Well, depending on the model it could take 1-2 seconds, but that's probably not the case\nstudent: Unless they have a very bad infrastructure...\nteacher: Yes, having said that, my laptop is anything but lightning fast...\nstudent: usually you want this sort of answers in less than half a second or so...\nstudent: Haha, but they should have dedicated computers which are there only to do that...\nteacher: Right, that makes sense!\nteacher: Fascinating to think about .and I guess we'll have to think about these things more and more, looking further ahead.\nteacher: but I've got to let you go!\nstudent: Yep, now I need to go back and work on my AIs ;.\nstudent: Thank you for the lesson! Next time, same place, same hour?\nstudent: *next week\nteacher: Have a nice day! Yes, absolutely!\nteacher: and we'll talk about the writing\nstudent: Okay, great! Bye :.\nteacher: Bye, Sophia Smith :.",
    "teacher: Hi!\nteacher: Hi Olivia Smith!\nstudent: Hi Mrs. Thompson! How are you?\nteacher: I'm so sorry, I got stuck on the railway crossing!\nstudent: No worries .\nteacher: All good, thank you! I had a lovely morning in town, and my hair is about 10 cm shorter!\nstudent: How is your haircut?\nteacher: I love it, thank you! It's the first time I've been to shops since... hmmm... maybe January\nteacher: I know I shouldn't rub it in though, because you're still in lockdown\nstudent: rub?\nstudent: Ok, so you did some shopping too?\nteacher: to rub something in = to show off the good things you have the person you're talking to hasn't\nteacher: For example, if you're not allowed to go to shops and I keep telling you about a lovely shopping trip I've just done\nstudent: like to make someone jealous?\nteacher: I went to the library and returned some books, and borrowed some new books, then I went to Superdrug .like Ukrainian Watsons, same company., and then to a Lithuanian shop where I found some salo .!. and zefir .!!!.\nteacher: Yes, that's right, not to make the person you're talking to jealous\nstudent: salo? wow .\nstudent: Actually do you know this British snack like \u0448\u043a\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0438?\nteacher: lardons?\nteacher: Yes, there is lard for cooking, which is smalets\nstudent: it's very dry\nteacher: And there are fatty bits of bacon called lardons\nteacher: Oh, I see! Jerky? Like beef jerky?\nstudent: You can buy it like crisps\nteacher: Yes, I'm with you. Beef jerky\nteacher: or pork jerky I guess\nstudent: I've checked jerky\nstudent: no\nstudent: I will write you later\nstudent: don't remember the name .\nteacher: Like this?\nteacher: Oh, you've looked it up already\nteacher: jerky = dried meat that you can eat like crisps\nteacher: or maybe smoked\nstudent: I see .\nteacher: Not what you meant?\nteacher: But lardons are bits of fatty bacon which are used, for example, in pasta carbonara\nstudent: I think no\nstudent: I've tried it at a pub in York\nteacher: Hmmm, I'm not sure!\nstudent: I will check after the lesson\nteacher: Have you ever been to Poland? It's lard .smalets. everywhere, they use it like butter!\nstudent: this thing tastes completely like shkvarky\nstudent: But dry shkvarky\nstudent: when you fry them for a long time .\nteacher: Sounds like lardons to me\nteacher: Or it could have been bacon?\nstudent: I know lard . and I've been to Poland .TO!!! ..\nstudent: But I don't like it\nstudent: .\nteacher: Does 'to' sound strange in 'I've been to...'?\nstudent: I think it's like very small pieces of bacon and very dry\nteacher: Yes, maybe some very crispy fried bacon\nstudent: No, it just reminded me that we talked about the preposition TO in such sentences, but if I used it I would use it wrongly\nstudent: And I'm not sure about my conditional ..\nteacher: Ah, I think we haven't talked properly about them\nteacher: I've been to London many times  vs. I've been in London for three weeks now\nteacher: What's the difference?\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: *I don't like lard either, by the way\nstudent: ..\nstudent: And what are you going to do with Salo? Just eat or did you buy it for cooking something?\nstudent: Ok\nstudent: the difference\nstudent: When I'm not in London now I have to use TO\nstudent: And if I'm there now (I wish) I have to use in?\nteacher: I've put in the freezer, and I'm going to cut off some paper-thin slices and eat them on some rye bread...\nstudent: mmm, sounds good ..\nstudent: sounds good?\nteacher: Yes! If you're talking about your experience, something you've done before, it's 'I've been to...'\nteacher: Sounds good, correct!\nteacher: It does sound good, doesn't it? The only way to eat salo, in my opinion :.\nteacher: But if you're still 'in' this place, then it's in!\nteacher: I've now been in the UK for 5 years\nteacher: But: Have you ever been TO the UK?\nstudent: ok\nstudent: it seems like I see ..\nteacher: Yes, I'm sure you see the difference :.\nstudent: I see but let's check if I will use it correctly ...\nteacher: Sure! Can you fill in the gaps, please?\nteacher: Which European countries have you been ____?\nstudent: Ah, and what about zefir?\nstudent: It's like Ukrainian one?\nstudent: Which European countries have you been to?\nteacher: I've just tried it, it's not Roshen, but it's pretty good, I must say!\nteacher: Yes!\nteacher: And can you answer this question? I'm curious, I bet it's quite a list!\nstudent: Ok\nstudent: I've been to the UK\nstudent: to Poland\nstudent: to Georgia\nstudent: to Germany\nstudent: to Austria\nstudent: to Finland\nstudent: to Estonia\nstudent: to Hungary\nteacher: Sweden and Italy too?\nstudent: to Italy\nstudent: to Sweden ..\nstudent: yes .. I forgot ..\nteacher: Oh wow, you're so well-travelled!!\nstudent: ok and to Spain\nstudent: to France\nstudent: ..\nteacher: Very impressive!\nstudent: I would like to go to Malta\nstudent: It's like my dream\nteacher: Yes, me too! It's supposed to be so beautiful!\nstudent: not a big dream ..\nstudent: haha\nteacher: not big, but beautiful!\nstudent: Agree\nstudent: Ah! I would like to go to Greece too\nteacher: By the way, could you give me a full sentence with 'agree'?\nstudent: Ashley invited me\nstudent: I agree with you\nteacher: Yes, thank you :. it's just such a common mistake of Russian speakers, but you didn't make it :.\nstudent: Ah! I have to write it\nstudent: I've been to Portugal! And I love the country\nteacher: Oh, I can't wait to go to Portugal! It's next on my list\nstudent: You have to go there when the situation lets us travel .\nstudent: It's my love!\nteacher: You know, our new year resolution of 2020 was to start travelling more. Hahaha!\nteacher: Anyway, let's not tease ourselves!\nstudent: Oh! traveling more! ..\nstudent: tease? .\nteacher: A quick conditionals quiz. If there ____ no pandemic, we ____ travel much more now.\nstudent: \u0434\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u0438\u0442\u044c?\nstudent: If there was no pandemic, we would travel much more now.\nstudent: aha\nstudent: after would I need just 1st form\nteacher: Yes, draznit'!!\nteacher: Yes, correct! Second conditional\nteacher: If there __ ___ ___ a pandemic, we ___ ____ ____ much more in 2020\nstudent: If there had not been a pandemic, we would have travelled much more in 2020\nstudent: I'm not sure\nteacher: One tiny mistake! Past perfect in the first part, so not 'has' but...\nstudent: had\nteacher: Yes!\nstudent: ok\nstudent: I see\nteacher: Oh sorry, we would have travelled much more\nteacher: I should have said that the verb is 'travel'\nstudent: Ah\nstudent: I see\nstudent: I should have guessed right\nteacher: Can I keep you until 14.40 today? Sorry about being late!!\nstudent: Maybe 14:35 is better\nstudent: ok?\nstudent: .\nteacher: Yes, sure!\nteacher: Ok, the videos I sent you last time are all about children's books. I thought you might enjoy this topic :.\nstudent: The Gruffalo? .\nteacher: It's an interview with an editor who works with children's books, and then short interviews with some people in the street about their favourite books\nteacher: Including the Gruffalo :.\nstudent: ok .\nteacher: I thought I would ask you some of the interview questions first, and then you can listen to the videos as your homework. Will that work?\nteacher: The vocabulary in the videos should be quite familiar I think. Some interesting words:\nteacher: The editor talks about having 'a quiet moment of reflection'. You know 'reflection'? Basically 'thinking'\nteacher: a quiet moment to think\nstudent: Yeah, now it's so trendy . to talk like that in Russian\nstudent: \u044f \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e \u0440\u043a\u0444\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b \u043d\u0430 \u0442\u0435\u043c\u0443 \u0431\u043b\u0430 \u0431\u043b\u0430 \u0431\u043b\u0430\nstudent: ....\nteacher: Haha, really? Ooh, it's funny :....\nstudent: Yeah ..\nteacher: Ok, that makes the word more familiar! :.\nteacher: Ok, and when we're reading to a child who can't read yet, we 'read aloud'\nteacher: Do you like reading aloud to Sophie?\nstudent: I like to read .reading?. aloud to Sophie.\nteacher: Yes, I like to read / I like reading = same thing\nstudent: Now we read aloud about the Disney Princesses ..\nteacher: Haha, oh goodness, poor you!\nstudent: haha\nteacher: Ok, and I bet you know the word 'contemporary'? contemporary art, contemporary literature\nteacher: I have a feel it's been borrowed into Russian too\nteacher: *a feeling\nstudent: Yes\nstudent: I know the expressions .\nteacher: contemporary = modern\nteacher: contEmporary\nstudent: Aha\nteacher: the stress\nteacher: Ok, lovely\nstudent: I see .\nteacher: Literature' is a noun and the adjective is 'literary'\nteacher: for example, an author's literary style is their style of writing\nteacher: /\u02c8l\u026at.\u0259r.\u0259r.i/\nstudent: Ah\nstudent: interesting\nstudent: you know the expression\nstudent: with literary\nstudent: like \u0431\u0443\u043a\u0432\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e in Russian\nteacher: Aah, good one! it's 'literally'\nstudent: so the word has two translations\nteacher: literally vs. literary\nstudent: Ah!!\nstudent: I see now\nstudent: Thank you\nteacher: It's good that you've brought it up, they sound very similar!\nstudent: it's not the same .\nteacher: literally from 'litera' as 'a letter', right? just like bukvalno\nstudent: aha\nstudent: Thank you!\nteacher: Ok, sure. I think most of the interview should be quite easy to understand .and hopefully interesting!.\nteacher: The titles of books might be difficult, feel free to ignore them!\nstudent: I will listen to it\nstudent: Ok . Will ignore ...\nteacher: So just unzip the folder I send you and watch them, there are several short videos\nstudent: ok! Thank you!\nteacher: Ok, and when shall we speak again? Monday?\nstudent: Monday is good\nteacher: Lovely, 12.30, right?\nstudent: As usual 12:30 my time?\nstudent: Ok! See you .\nteacher: Yes, sure!\nstudent: Thank you!\nstudent: Have a good afternoon\nteacher: Have a lovely weekend, talk to you then!\nstudent: Bye xx\nteacher: Thanks, bye :.\nstudent: Thank you!!",
    "student: Hi, Mr. Johnson! How are you? How was your weekend?\nteacher: Hi Sophia Smith!\nteacher: I'm great, thank you! We had a really nice Easter holiday, with a short spell of nice weather .now it's really cold again.\nteacher: What about you? How have you been?\nstudent: I am fine, it's a lockdown here again\nteacher: Yes, I know! How's it going for you?\nstudent: okay\nteacher: Are you studying from home again?\nstudent: yeah\nteacher: Ok, I've actually prepared a few phrases for you, to talk about how things are\nstudent: okie\nteacher: Do you the word 'advantage'?\nteacher: an advantage\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Yes, a positive thing about something, right?\nstudent: like pros (and cons)\nteacher: What's the opposite of advantage? a ...advantage\nstudent: disadvantage\nteacher: Yes, an advantage = a pro\nteacher: Yes, correct!\nteacher: Another word for 'advantage' is 'upside'\nteacher: And can you guess the word for 'disadvantage'? a ....side\nstudent: downside?\nteacher: Yes!\nteacher: Ok, and the expressions are...\nteacher: One of the advantages / disadvantages of .the lockdown, the spring, studying from home etc.. is that....\nteacher: or\nteacher: The upside / downside is that....\nteacher: Also\nteacher: The most annoying / exciting / boring thing about..... is.....\nteacher: The thing I hate / love most about ..... is ...\nteacher: For example, for me: The most exciting thing about spring is that I get to start planting fruit and vegetables in my garden.\nteacher: The most annoying thing right now is that it's still so cold!\nteacher: The thing I loved about our holiday is that we could go out to nice places in our new car.\nteacher: But the downside of having a car is that I now have to learn to drive!\nteacher: Could you give me a few sentences about your life at the moment, please? Maybe 5-6\nstudent: One of the advantages of the lockdown is that I can make my grades better\nteacher: You missed one word! .grammar.\nstudent: Another advantage is that I have more free time\nstudent: is\nteacher: Yes, lovely!\nstudent: The most exciting thing is that I can rest more and feel better\nstudent: The thing I love is that I sleep more\nteacher: The thing I love ___ that I sleep more\nstudent: The upside is that I spend more time with my parents\nstudent: is\nteacher: Ok, great, more time with your parents!\nteacher: Yes to 'is' :.\nteacher: Sounds like you're quite happy for now, aren't you?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Good! What do you do with your extra free time?\nstudent: I started watching anime and another series\nteacher: Nice! An animated series?\nstudent: no\nstudent: do you know The Queen's Gambit?\nteacher: Oh yes, I've seen it!\nteacher: Are you watching the Queens's Gambit?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Cool!! I was thinking about you when I was watching it, because of chess :.\nstudent: heh\nteacher: But I hope your experience of chess is different from Beth's :..\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Are you enjoying the show? How far into it are you?\nstudent: because I didn't live in 1967 and my parents are still alive.\nstudent: I only watched the 1 episode with my parents\nteacher: Yes, thankfully! And I hope you don't have to take drugs to play :..\nteacher: Ah, sorry, I hope I haven't given anything away!\nstudent: yeah\nstudent: no that's fine\nteacher: Have you got Netflix then?\nstudent: no\nteacher: Ok, sure\nstudent: I don't know the name of the service, we bought it for tv and we can watch it\nteacher: It could be Netflix! The Queen's Gambit is on Netflix\nteacher: If you have Netflix, there's lots of stuff that would be good to watch in English :.\nstudent: I know\nteacher: Have you watched anything in English? I'm curious how it might work for you\nstudent: I watched Grinch once on Linguaviva Institute\nteacher: Oh yes, the new one or the old one? There are so many Grinches!\nstudent: new\nteacher: Yes, I wonder if it's the same one that my son and I watch every Christmas\nteacher: Ok, let's go back to that video about the experiment psychologist did at one of English ...... .places where small children are looked after while their parents work\nstudent: kindergarten?.\nteacher: a n......\nstudent: nursery!\nteacher: correct!\nteacher: a kindergarten is more of an American word, it's 'nursery' or 'pre-school' in the UK\nteacher: Ok! Do you remember much about that experiment .or trial.?\nstudent: yeah something\nteacher: What do you remember? Or are you not sure?\nstudent: an experiment at the nursery was done by the university of Bristol, they gave children magnets to play with for a whole month instead of toys\nteacher: Yes, that's right! Have you just rewatched the video?\nstudent: no\nteacher: You've got a good memory!\nstudent: about the university, I looked it up in the transcript, I remembered the rest\nteacher: Sure!\nteacher: Ok, and researchers were saying that playing with magnets and tools develops 'dexterity' in children\nteacher: dexterity = the ability to move .and manipulate objects. quickly and well\nteacher: For example, to play ball games people need a lot of dexterity\nteacher: Also surgeons .doctors who perform operations. need a lot of dexterity\nteacher: surgical dexterity\nteacher: /dek\u02c8ster.\u0259.ti/\nteacher: Also, knitting and crafts all develop dexterity\nteacher: Ok, and then we were talking about 'gender stereotypes'. Do you remember what those are?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Ok, could you explain it in your own words?\nteacher: or give an example\nstudent: like girls must play with dolls and boys with cars\nteacher: Yes, and girls should be pretty and boys should be strong and never cry etc. etc.\nteacher: and women and men, too, of course\nteacher: the verb was 'reinforce' = make something stronger\nteacher: Which toys did the researchers think reinforced gender stereotypes?\nstudent: magnets and imagination\nteacher: Hmm, to reinforce = to make something .gender stereotypes. stronger\nteacher: magnets are quiet gender-neutral, aren't they?\nstudent: oh\nstudent: yeah they are\nteacher: Yes, so it's probably princesses for girls and male superheroes for boys that reinforce gender stereotypes, right?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Do you think it's important to give children gender-neutral toys? Or are toys 'for girls' or 'for boys' important, too?\nteacher: Ooops, sorry, something went wrong\nstudent: It is important to give children gender neutral toys. Of course other toys can exist, but it means everebody can play with them - no matter boy or girl\nteacher: Yes, sure, I agree!\nteacher: Do you think it's possible to raise children without gender stereotypes at all? Would it be a good idea? What would we need to do to achieve this?\nstudent: it would be a good idea, if I have a family in the future, I don't want my child to feel bad because of the stereotypes,\nteacher: Yes, definitely. It's quite hard to do, though. Even at supermarkets, there are clearly toys for girls and toys for boys\nstudent: of couse not all people think so, so maybe children can face stereotypes at schools or even at home\nteacher: And clothes as well. Dinosaur prints for boys and flowers / unicorns for girls\nstudent: yeah\nteacher: Yes, I completely agree. Even if parents do their best to avoid stereotypes at home, they can be reinforced at school etc.\nteacher: I also think it would be a good idea if there were more role models. For example, if some of nursery teachers were male\nstudent: yes!!!\nteacher: Have you got any male teachers at school?\nstudent: I definitely agree\nstudent: hm\nstudent: the math teacher, the PE teacher, the history teacher and the geography teacher\nstudent: they are one of the best teachers\nteacher: Haha, another stereotype, right?\nstudent: no\nteacher: But it's hard to find male teachers and assistants at nurseries\nteacher: Don't you hate your geography teacher?\nstudent: really, they are kind and they love kids\nstudent: that's the male teacher and not mine\nteacher: Oh lovely, sorry! I see what you mean\nstudent: mine is female\nteacher: Ah, I see!\nteacher: mine' is female\nstudent: all my teachers now are female\nteacher: Ok Sophia Smith, it was nice to talk to you as usual, talk to you again next Friday!\nteacher: Right, I see!\nstudent: okay, thank you for the lesson! bye bye\nteacher: Bye!:.",
    "student: Hi Mrs. Rodriguez!\nteacher: Morning!\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: Afternoon ..\nstudent: Fine, thank you\nteacher: Haha, yes, I suppose it is nearly afternoon for you! sorry.\nstudent: A bit sleepy\nteacher: Did you have a nice weekend?\nstudent: Yes, thank you, we went to my mom on Saturday and saw Sophie, James and Sophia\nstudent: Sophie took a huge number of her old toys\nteacher: Sounds nice!\nstudent: Emily was sooo happy .\nteacher: Haha, I can imagine!\nstudent: a Tinker Bell doll\nstudent: a Cinderella doll\nstudent: little ponies\nstudent: wings (don't ask)..\nstudent: a wings doll\nteacher: Heaven!....\nteacher: I'm curious now\nstudent: and even a motorbike ..\nteacher: Did Sophie give them to her? To keep?\nstudent: Yes, she gives all her toys to Emily, she (Sophie) doesn't play with them\nteacher: and even a motorbike, wow!\nteacher: she ____ all her toys to Emily\nteacher: It's nice to have an older cousin :.\nstudent: I'll send you a video of how Tinker Bell goes on the motorbike ..\nstudent: she gave all her toys to Emily\nteacher: Nice!\nstudent: then we left Emily with my mom and went to a drive-in cinema\nstudent: I'm not sure about the name in English\nteacher: we left Emily with my mom and _____\nstudent: went .\nstudent: sorry\nstudent: I like to live today not yesterday ....\nstudent: haha\nteacher: Yes!...\nteacher: a drive-in cinema?\nstudent: Yeah! Drive-in cinema!\nteacher: Oh, where you get your own speaker, for the car?\nstudent: Yes! They just tell us which \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0442\u0443 we need\nstudent: And we have our own sound in the car\nteacher: which frequency you need :.\nstudent: But we can see a big screen\nteacher: Sounds very cool! And lockdown-friendly\nteacher: What did you watch?\nstudent: aha! Which frequency we need\nstudent: Yes! We like it\nteacher: Yes, a drive-in cinema. If something is outdoors, like a cinema or a festival, it's open-air\nstudent: But it's not too convenient if we talk about timing because they need darkness to show the picture on the screen\nteacher: an open-air cinema, sounds good when the weather is good :)\nstudent: so the first film is at 20:30 and the second one at 23:00 usually\nteacher: Yes, exactly! We wanted to get a screen and a projector for our garden last year, but in the summer, when it's nice to sit outside, it doens't get dark until 10-11 pm! Not very family-friendly\nstudent: agree\nteacher: Perhaps one day when Sarah's older. Even though I'm so used to going to bed at 10 pm, I don't know if I'll ever be able to stay up!\nstudent: and we have to decide where and who we can leave Emily with\nstudent: haha\nstudent: Oh, I like to go to bed very very late\nteacher: Are you more of an owl?\nstudent: It's a pleasure for me .\nstudent: I like the time from 10 am to about 1 am\nstudent: But if I need to wake up early it's hard .\nteacher: That's very late for me! 1 am!\nstudent: I'm 100% an owl\nstudent: But I feel ok if I wake up early when I sleep enough in the night\nteacher: I see! I am too, but in the summer, when it's lovely and light in the morning, I don't want to miss the mornings! I like to go in the garden with my first cup of coffee\nteacher: Yes, that's the thing. To feel ok in the morning, I have to go to bed early!\nstudent: Agree\nteacher: Ok, you said you managed to watch most of the videos about books, didn't you? What did you think?\nstudent: With time we understand that a good morning is better than a fun night ..\nstudent: the fun\nteacher: Yes, we're becoming old and boring!\nstudent: I've watched three of them\nstudent: I wasn't sure if I have to watch 4-6\nstudent: I liked the videos\nstudent: They are very understandable\nteacher: 4-6 was 'people in the street' talking about their favourite books, you can always watch them later\nteacher: Good! I'm glad to hear that!\nstudent: Is the woman British?\nteacher: Yes, she sounds British! Next time, I'm planning to find an American speaker for you\nteacher: She was talking about parents reading to children, and when we read to a child who can't read themselves, the expression is to 'read a....'\nstudent: aloud\nteacher: Yes!\nteacher: and a synonym to 'modern'? modern = ?\nstudent: contemporary\nteacher: coNtemporary, a typo, right?\nstudent: contemporary\nstudent: sure\nteacher: Cool\nteacher: and an adjective for 'literare'?\nteacher: Sorry! literature!\nteacher: literature .noun. = ?? .adjective.\nstudent: literary\nteacher: Yes :.\nstudent: and I have two more new expressions from the video\nteacher: Yes, please?\nstudent: one more that is not clear to me\nstudent: a remarkable quality\nteacher: Ah, good one! remarkable = out of the ordinary, in a good way\nstudent: I think I understand\nteacher: If someone's writing is of remarkable quality, it's really good\nstudent: Be on the threat\nteacher: be on the threat? Hmm, do you remember where it is in the video?\nteacher: a threat is something one person says to scare another\nteacher: For example, I'll come to your house at night and steal Tinkerbell on the motorbike!\nteacher: That's a threat :.\nteacher: I'll take away your mobile phone if you don't work harder at school!\nstudent: She said that when TV became more popular reading was on the treath\nstudent: I think I understand the expression\nteacher: Hmm, I'll have a listen in a minute!\nstudent: Part 2 or 3 I think\nteacher: Ok, no problem\nteacher: She also said that she read her favourite book when she wanted 'a quiet moment of (thinking)'\nteacher: thinking = ?\nstudent: \u043a\u0443\u0430\u0434\u0443\u0441\u0435\u0448\u0449\u0442\nstudent: oh\nstudent: sorry .\nstudent: reflection\nteacher: Yes! What do you do when you need a quiet moment of reflection?\nstudent: A cup of coffee\nstudent: cap\nteacher: cup...\nstudent: And when I smoked it was a cigarette ..\nstudent: oh\nstudent: yes!\nstudent: cup .\nteacher: Sure!\nstudent: a cap is for the head ..\nstudent: Or now it could be a cup of tea\nstudent: I like normal tea ..\nteacher: Ooh, I found it! She says, people often think books are under threat from other media (TV, social networks etc.)\nteacher: under threat\nstudent: I heard the expression in England\nstudent: black tea is normal tea ..\nteacher: Normal tea? Black tea with milk is normal tea in England :.\nstudent: Aaaah\nstudent: under\nstudent: not on the\nteacher: Yes, it makes sense now!\nstudent: \u043f\u043e\u0434 \u0443\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0437\u043e\u0439\nteacher: The same in Russian\nteacher: yes, exactly\nstudent: yes!\nstudent: ok\nstudent: and the third one\nstudent: It's part 3 and 2.06 min\nstudent: something like Being totally o\u2026 in the book\nstudent: But I can't hear\nteacher: Ok, thanks for the exact time! I'll ask you a question and have a listen\nteacher: The same interview questions, almost :.\nteacher: What was your favourite book when you were a child?\nstudent: I had a favorite book just when I was about 6 or 7\nstudent: It was \u041a\u0430\u0440\u043b\u0441\u043e\u043d, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0439 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u0440\u044b\u0448\u0435\nstudent: I'm not sure about the name in English\nteacher: I ____ a favourite book! You're living in the now again!\nstudent: I had .\nstudent: haha\nstudent: So am I .\nteacher: Karlsson-on-the-Roof!\nstudent: Yeah!\nteacher: Oh, that's a great book!\nteacher: I've just ordered Pippi Longstocking for Sarah\nteacher: Can you guess which one it is?\nstudent: Actually I never liked Pippi, sorry ..\nteacher: Fair enough!\nstudent: But I remember now\nstudent: That I liked something about \u041a\u0430\u043b\u043b\u0435 \u0411\u043b\u044e\u043c\u043a\u0432\u0438\u0441\u0442 by Astrid Lindgren\nteacher: He loves the 'How to Train Your Dragon' series, which is all about boys, and I thought I'd get him a book with a strong female protagonist, for balance\nteacher: I've never heard about this one!\nstudent: It's like a detective story for children\nteacher: Sounds cool\nstudent: Mrs. Rodriguez : He loves the 'How to Train Your Dragon' series, which is all about boys, and I thought I'd get him a book with a strong female protagonist, for balance - it's a cool idea!\nteacher: Oh, I've listened to the expression. She talks about being 'totally absorbed in the book'\nteacher: when all you want to do is read the book, and the book is all you can think about!\nstudent: Mrs. Rodriguez : Sounds cool - if you manage to find it in English I would recommend to buy it for Sarah\nstudent: I think maybe 1-2 years later\nteacher: I'll definitely look into it, thank you!\nstudent: absorbed!!! I\nstudent: I caught the meaning\nstudent: but not the word .\nteacher: And have you got a favourite book / children's author to read aloud to Emily?\nteacher: Yes, we can be totally absorbed in a book, video game, movie, Facebook :.\nstudent: I like Julia Donaldson's books\nteacher: Ah, she is so great!\nstudent: I like Donald Bisset's books but she doesn't .\nstudent: And I like \u0412\u043e\u043b\u0448\u0435\u0431\u043d\u0438\u043a \u0438\u0437\u0443\u043c\u0440\u0443\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\nstudent: You know the book\nteacher: Oh, yes, the Wizard of Emerald City, the Russian version of the Wizard of Oz\nteacher: Donald Bisset is still a mystery to me, in that I can't find his books in English!\nstudent: The Wizard of Oz\nstudent: \u041d\u0443\u044b\nstudent: yes\nstudent: but different\nteacher: I'm thinking, maybe it was a pen name? Maybe he wasn't real?\nstudent: I think he was\nstudent: He was an actor\nstudent: or like a TV presenter\nteacher: Ok, I need to do more research!\nstudent: once I looked him up on the Internet .\nteacher: Ok, one more question! What helps a child become a reader? in your opinion\nstudent: I think just lots of books at home and a mum or a dad (or other relatives) who read\nstudent: who read will be better\nstudent: who read? .\nteacher: a very good correction!\nteacher: Yes, who read! Because you mean 'regularly', not 'at the moment'\nteacher: Do you think it's important for a child to be a reader?\nstudent: But I think it's like Karlsson in Sweden\nstudent: Nobody knows him there\nstudent: Same story with Donald Bisset books there in the UK\nstudent: It's important but you can't make them into readers I think\nteacher: Yes, I think the Soviet Union borrowed an interesting selection of writers, not necessarily the ones that were popular at home!\nstudent: just to show them that it's interesting\nstudent: and to try to find some interesting books for them\nstudent: For example me and my brother\nteacher: Yes, I agree with you! And I think it's not the end of the world if they don't read!\nstudent: he is a \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 reader\nstudent: I'm a reader but just a usual one.\nteacher: He is a passionate reader :)\nstudent: a 50% reader ..\nteacher: Oh wait, the expression is 'an avid reader'\nstudent: we have the same family\nteacher: Haha, yes, I see!\nstudent: same examples\nstudent: but we are different people .\nteacher: an avid reader and a casual reader :.\nteacher: Definitely!\nstudent: haha, yes .\nteacher: Ok, thank you very much! If you have the time, feel free to watch the rest of the videos, there are three more people, all with English accents, talking about children's books\nstudent: But I agree with the woman from the interview\nteacher: And we will chat again on Friday, right? Not Wednesday?\nteacher: Oh yes, what about?\nstudent: We all need the chemical moment when the story captures you and you can't stop reading\nstudent: It's the magic of books\nstudent: I will watch\nstudent: thank you!\nteacher: Yes, exactly! The magic of books!\nstudent: Yes, we'll chat on Friday at the usual time .\nstudent: 12:30 .\nteacher: Sure!\nteacher: Ok, have a lovely day!\nstudent: thank you for the lesson\nteacher: My pleasure :.\nstudent: thank you! You too\nstudent: bye xx\nteacher: Thanks, bye :)",
    "student: Hello Ms. Johnson!\nteacher: Hi Sophia Williams!\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: I'm fine! Thank you. And you?\nstudent: I did Part 1 of Listening\nteacher: Good, thank you!\nteacher: Ok, cool! How did it go?\nstudent: No mistakes\nstudent: How about we continue together?\nteacher: Yaay, well done!\nstudent: I've got everything set up =.\nteacher: Hmm, I'm just worried we won't produce as much of a chat as we would otherwise!\nstudent: Oh, I see\nstudent: Ok then.\nteacher: Sorry!\nstudent: Sure\nteacher: I think the following parts are longer chunks of listening, too\nteacher: I mean, longer audio files\nstudent: It appears so\nteacher: Shall we go back to the Use of English we started on last time? From the teacher's handbook pdf\nstudent: Yes. Let's do that\nteacher: Lovely! I think we stopped at part 3\nstudent: What handbook should I open?\nstudent: The printed one?\nstudent: The pdf?\nteacher: The one I sent to you last time, please. The pdf is called 168194-c2-proficiency teachers booklet\nteacher: I can re-send it!\nstudent: That would be great\nteacher: Sure\nstudent: I can't seem to find it\nteacher: You should have it in a sec\nteacher: It should be page 16 for you I think. Trouble is, the page count in my pdf reader is different from online!\nstudent: Do we start with Part 4?\nteacher: Part 3, please! I don't think we did part 3\nstudent: Ok. Got it\nteacher: Or did we?\nstudent: 17 scarcity\nstudent: 18 genetically\nstudent: 19 occurence\nstudent: occurrence\nteacher: good correction!\nstudent: 20 sensitivity\nstudent: thanks .\nstudent: 21 spectacularly\nstudent: 22 advantageous\nstudent: 23 progressively\nstudent: 24 evolution\nteacher: Ah, you need an adjective in 24\nstudent: evolving\nteacher: evolutionary\nstudent: aha\nstudent: that's right\nteacher: as in 'an evolutionary advantage'\nstudent: right\nteacher: But otherwise, all correct! Well done you!\nstudent: thank you\nstudent: next?\nteacher: Yes, please! Your favourite\nstudent: The next one is tricky though\nstudent: ...\nstudent: 25 ???\nstudent: 26 Mira tried not to take sides in the argument between...\nteacher: Ok, in key word transformation task, you get 2 points for each number. Even if you don't know the expression with 'way', it's worth scoring at least one point with the passive\nstudent: *take sides\nteacher: 26. Correct!\nstudent: ok\nstudent: Passengers were instructed to make their way down the bus\nteacher: Nearly! were instructed to make THEIR way...:.\nstudent: almost...\nstudent: 27 The carnival's success was under threat due to lack of support\nstudent: 28.... his decision was not open for discussion\nteacher: Hmm, could you check the tense, please? And an article is missing\nteacher: in 27\nstudent: Oh sure. Sorry\nstudent: is under threat due to the lack\nteacher: Yes, correct!\nstudent: 29 No matter how late it'll be ....\nstudent: 30 I just caught sight (a glimpse?) of Emma\nteacher: The tense again in 29.\nstudent: do we need to use the present tense after 'no matter'?\nteacher: caught a glimpse / caught sight (no article) of = both correct\nstudent: the present tense\nteacher: Yes, you hardly ever need to change the tense in key word transformation!\nstudent: Ok. Then. No matter how late it is\nstudent: caught sight of -- noted\nteacher: In fact, this is one of the things to watch out for, whether it's the same tense (or similar, both present / past / future)\nteacher: And one last for 28: was not open TO FURTHER discussion\nteacher: Tricky, I know!\nstudent: Right. We need to keep as much original information as possible\nteacher: Yes, true! Unlike in speaking and writing, you actually paraphrase as little as possible\nteacher: In speaking and writing, you're encouraged to paraphrase, to show that you can use a range of vocabulary, not just the words from the task\nstudent: Right. Makes sense\nteacher: Ok! I actually thought we might practise some speaking questions today. Again, with the aim to show off that lovely language!\nstudent: Maybe more tests? =.\nteacher: Nooo! Let's do something fun!\nteacher: My idea of fun :.\nstudent: Tests are fun for me\nstudent: Speaking, however......\nteacher: Ha, I'm like that too, to be honest!\nteacher: As you probably know, a part of the speaking is a collaborative task where you discuss something with the other candidate\nteacher: And at least two parts are picture-based. An examiner gives you some pictures and asks questions based on them\nteacher: Also, you will be expected to comment on the questions the other candidate is asked (not on their answers, thankfully!)\nteacher: But there are also some plain old question at the end, which give you a chance to speak on your own for a longer time\nstudent: Yes. I remember\nteacher: Even though some examiners invite an exchange of opinions between candidates as well\nteacher: At C2 level, they are quite abstract, the questions\nstudent: Right\nteacher: The first part, however, are nice warm-up questions\nteacher: The examiner says, I'd like to find out something about you. Where are you from? Are you working or studying? .the traditional beginning of all Cambridge English speaking exams it seems.\nteacher: And then something like\nteacher: What do you enjoy best about the place where you're living now?\nteacher: Could you give me 2-3-4 nice sentences?\nstudent: Oh... It'll be tough\nteacher: Well, you can always say that at the moment, in lockdown, it's hard to think of things you enjoy - as long as you give a nice answer in terms of language, it doesn't even have to be truthful!\nstudent: I would say the location, as my home is in the city center. It takes me 5 minutes to reach the nearest metro station. Moreover, I can just walk to Khreschatyk and avoid using any means of transport altogether. Other perks include the proximity to the Botanical Garden and other green zones.\nstudent: * I would say\nteacher: Lovely!\nstudent: But trust me\nstudent: It would have been much more messy in speech\nstudent: It would be\nstudent: ....\nteacher: Hmm, I don't know if I believe you because I heard you speak and you're fluent..\nstudent: When was it?\nstudent: I don't remember...\nteacher: Ok, next Cambridge wants to know, How difficult would it be for you to move away from the area you're living in now?\nteacher: Back when you just opened ALMA I believe!\nstudent: By the way, does the exam panel assess accents?\nstudent: Oh right! Maybe at Alias\nstudent: My memory has worsened quite a bit after Maya's birth\nteacher: It's absolutely fine to have an accent, everybody does (even the queen). They assess intelligibility, the pronunciation / mispronunciation of individual words, sentence stress and intonation\nteacher: Yes, it must have been a game of Alias! I can't remember very clearly either\nteacher: So unless your accent impedes comprehension, you're fine!\nteacher: Ok, so How difficult would it be for you to move away from the area you're living in now?\nteacher: (see what they are doing? eliciting conditionals and the language of speculation, like modals)\nstudent: Not difficult at all. You see, the advantages I've just provided cannot override the disadvantages of my residential area. They are poor air quality, noise pollution, forlorn playgrounds and shabby infrastructure. So I'd move in no time.\nstudent: overrule or maybe override\nteacher: Perfect! Great answer\nteacher: override would be better, I agree!\nstudent: It took me a while because I forgot how to spell forlorn\nstudent: Although I know how to pronounce it\nteacher: You wouldn't have this problem in the speaking test!...\nstudent: Right. That's what I thought\nteacher: Yes, the centre of Kyiv is so lovely and green, but not without its challenges, is it?\nstudent: Indeed\nstudent: Yesterday, we travelled to Nyvky\nstudent: There's a residential area called Fayna Town\nteacher: Oh yes, I stayed there for a month while doing CELTA\nteacher: That must be new\nstudent: It's perfect in terms of air quality and infrastructure\nstudent: But the commute it tiring to say the least\nstudent: At peak hours around 2 hrs now\nteacher: I remember lots of fresh fruit and vegetables at the market and a giant park\nteacher: Ooh, horrible!\nstudent: Yes. The area is wonderful\nstudent: Our friends live there\nstudent: They've just bought an apartment\nteacher: Are there nice schools, too?\nstudent: Their daughter goes to a school on Arsenalna Street\nstudent: So I guess, no good schools\nteacher: That's faraway, isn't it? from Nyvky\nteacher: Ah, yes, that makes sense\nstudent: Yes, Arsenalna is near ALMA School\nteacher: Yes, I thought so\nstudent: Ok. It's time already\nstudent: I think\nteacher: Here in the UK, while kids are small, all house moves are dominated by the catchment area of schools. I bet it's universal though, for all families, not just in the UK, obviously\nstudent: Next Monday same time?\nteacher: Yes, I've got to let you go! Yes, sure, same time on Monday!\nstudent: Right. It's more or less the same everywhere\nteacher: Have a lovely week :.\nstudent: You too!\nstudent: Thank you for the lesson\nstudent: Bye!!!\nteacher: Yeah, of course, once you have a child:)\nteacher: My pleasure, by!\nteacher: bye!",
    "student: Hello!\nteacher: Hi Alexandra!\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: Great thank you! How about you?\nteacher: Good, thank you! The weather's finally warming up here, and I've been indulging my gardening obsession\nstudent: That sounds nice! Here the weather is still a bit variable, but temperatures are going up and that's great!\nteacher: Are they unlocking you yet? Or are you still in lockdown?\nstudent: They are going to relax a bit the restrictions starting in May...but I still can't go back to Italy, and that's the main problem...\nstudent: anyway it shouldn't take much longer...I hope...\nteacher: I hope so!\nstudent: I know in the UK things are starting to really get back to normal though, that's good news...but your vaccination rate is much higher than what we have here in Europe\nteacher: Ok, I've marked your C2 writing (and I also asked my husband to have a look, he used to be an examiner for C2 proficiency), and we were both really impressed! You did a great job!\nstudent: Oh, really? That sounds great, thank you!\nteacher: Yes, the next phase of unlocking comes on May 17 I believe. But now there's the Indian variant in the country, and they've closed the border too late! It's nerve-wracking\nteacher: I guess the vaccines will now have to be trialled in real life, not a controlled clinical setting, it terms of how much protection they give against the variants\nstudent: I see...and I don't really understand how people continue to travel...\nteacher: I don't either...\nstudent: especially areas with a lot of cases should be given special attention: the more cases you have, the more likely it is for a new variant to appear...\nteacher: Yes, and apparently the half-vaccinated population is a breeding ground for mutations as the virus bounces off the partial protection from vaccines and mutates\nteacher: Anyway, to something predictable and comforting, such as C2 profiency writing assessment!\nstudent: Haha, okay! But I am not sure 'comforting' really desribes my experience when writing ;.\nteacher: Well, again, the result was good! :.\nteacher: C2 writing is assessed in terms of 1. content, 2. communicative achievement, 3. organisation, 4. language\nteacher: The 'content' is about how relevant to the task someone's writing is. Has the candidate answered the questions fully?\nstudent: I understand...that's also the most relevant metric for the Italian text I wrote at school: in Italian we would say 'fuori tema' (lit. out of theme) for a text not answering the initial question...and this is an automatic fail\nteacher: I would say, you did a very good job, 'describing the situation' and 'explaining reasons why you took the decision'\nteacher: Yes, it's really really important to read the task carefully and keep in mind what you have to write! It won't be an automatic fail in C2 exam, though, just a fail for 'content'\nteacher: One thing that we felt was lacking was 'assessing the consequences that this decisoin might have in the future'\nteacher: You did say that it meant you now have excellent career prospects, but that was probably the only place you touched upon this!\nstudent: I see...I remember that I completed it just before the lesson, so I didn't think much about this question;\nstudent: but I am not sure I would have improved this side with some additional time: I didn't think about how you evaluate.\nteacher: No, I understand! I'm just trying to do a thorough job with explaining the marking criteria for you, I think it's important insight!\nstudent: For the next time, I should probably first write a short answer to each question on the side, so that I have some points to follow and not miss any relevant parts.\nstudent: Indeed it is an important insight: sometimes with little effort in just the right place, you can have a dramatic effect....\nteacher: That's a very good idea! And then you can turn each answer into a topic sentence. A boring but solid structure: introduction; paragraph 1 (topic sentence, expansion); paragraph 2 (topic sentence, expansion); conslusion\nteacher: Exactly! You need to know what to pay attention to\nteacher: So we decided on an 4 (out of 5) for content\nteacher: by 'we' I mean my husband and myself here\nteacher: *a 4\nstudent: I see :. perfect thank you! .by the way, when I did my FCE, writing was the worst part that almost didn't get me approved with merit, it is nice to see I improved on this :. .\nteacher: Oh really? I didn't remember / know that you took FCE!\nstudent: Also I'll make sure next time to answer all the question, if that's what we need. I don't know if I ever told you...it was the last year of high school .11 years ago....and I even lost the certificate so..\nteacher: Ok, communicative achievement! This is about how a piece of writing fits the pre-set genre .article, essay, letter in your case., how appropriate the register is, whether the writing is holding the target reader's attention, how effective it is at communicating what it needs to\nteacher: Well, your English has definitely improved in the last 11 years! I didn't know Italian schools used FCE as an English exam, good for Cambridge Assessment :.\nstudent: It was more of an extra, it didn't directly influence your English marks, but we prepared for it at school and many of our tests were similar to what you find in the FCE...\nteacher: And I would say you totally nailed with communicative achievement! The register is appropriate and homogenous throughout, it's obviously a letter .I really liked 'Dear editorial staff,' as opposed to 'Dear Sir / Madam' that's usually recommended.. And it was a good story to read, well told in with flexibility and style!\nteacher: *with, not 'in with'. Sorry, I'm trying to type fast and probably making lots of typos\nteacher: *nailed 'it'\nteacher: So a 5 for CA :)\nstudent: Okay, I can only be happy about this!\nteacher: Definitely!\nstudent: Especially because it looks like a complex task to learn and improve...I guess that reading a lot is paying off :.\nstudent: or paying out...hmm\nstudent: phrasal verbs sometimes are still complex for me...\nstudent: I guess it is paying out, right?#\nteacher: Sorry, paying off!\nteacher: Yes, my husband remarked that it's the writing of a well-read / educated person :) So it's definitely paying off!\nstudent: I just checked it in the dictionary, and okay...phrasal verbs can still be confusing at times\nteacher: Ok, we disagreed about 'organisation'. I thought it was very well organised and coherent throughout and gave you a 5, but my husband would have liked to see more 'linkers' and probably more of a structure to paragraphs (topic sentences, they love them in Cambridge), so he said 4\nstudent: I see...with linkers you mean beginning paragraphs with words like 'for this reason', 'given this information' etc.?\nteacher: Yes, exactly. We should look at linkers properly next time, I'll make a note.\nstudent: But then, it doesn't surprise me: I wrote without thinking much about the structure...next time I'll make sure to pay more attention to them.\nstudent: That would be great, thank you!\nteacher: Sure, will do!\nteacher: Ok, language! Overall, both controlled and sophisticated, but a few grammar slips and a couple of spelling mistakes brought it down to a 3\nteacher: Shall we have a quick look?\nstudent: Yes, absolutely!\nteacher: Ok, what's the difference between 'economic' and 'economical'?\nstudent: I don't know...maybe the first is an adjective and the second an adverb?\nteacher: No, they are both adjectives, but the meaning is different\nteacher: an economic crisis / situation / analysis\nteacher: but: hybrids are very economical cars, you will save a lot of petrol\nstudent: I see, okay...\nteacher: economical = not using too much money / fuel / resources\nteacher: so, as you can imagine, you were finding yourself in an unstable economic situation\nstudent: while economic is related to the economy\nstudent: yep\nteacher: Yes, exactly\nstudent: I see now,\nteacher: By the way, a precarious situation is a very good collocation\nteacher: unstable and likely to get worse\nteacher: Ok, lovely!\nteacher: *you will save a lot ON petrol. Goodness, typos, sorry!\nteacher: I almost dread to look back at what I'm writing here :)\nstudent: I see...in Italian we have 'una situazione precaria' which is exactly the same collocation...\nteacher: Yes, it is! :)\nteacher: Towards the completion of my studies it became clear my career opportunities in Italy where slim: finding an intellectually stimulating job would have been unlikely\nteacher: you obviously mean 'were', not 'where', another typo!\nstudent: Oh gosh, even now reading it again it slipped...absolutely!\nteacher: But more importantly, if it was a full conditional sentence, there would be an argument for 'would have been'\nstudent: That's really a basic mistake though...\nteacher: e.g. If I had stayed in Italy, finding a... job would have been unlikely\nteacher: But it's not a conditional sentence. In fact, you're describing the situation here\nstudent: So I am missing the first 'if' part?\nstudent: Oh okay, sorry...I am describing the situation\nteacher: finding a ... job was unlikely\nteacher: Just a situation in the past, right?\nstudent: Yes, just the simple past...\nteacher: And the same in the next sentence\nteacher: On the practical side of things, having a family would have meant an unstable economical situation.\nstudent: so 'would have meant' becomes 'meant'\nteacher: absolutely\nteacher: While remaining in my country would have been the easiest option I decided that I had little to lose in looking for an occupation in a neighbouring country.\nstudent: Okay, it makes sense...and it is also easier...\nteacher: Here, however, 'would have been' is totally justified\nstudent: There is the 'While' at the beginning, and this is an hypothesis\nstudent: I see :.\nteacher: because you didn't remain in your country, it's a speculation about a hypothetical situation in the past\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: Dear editorial staff, human lives are guided by decisions and, as with everything in life, every choice inherently carries some risks. Change can lead to unforeseen consequences, but choosing not to change might hinder our ability to grow and reduce our career and personal opportunities.\nteacher: I really liked the more abstract introduction before going into your own story\nteacher: Annoyingly, the paragraph after a greeting starts with a capital letter in English, even after a comma\nteacher: Dear editorial staff,\nteacher: Human lives...\nstudent: Okay, I'll take note to use this strategy in the future...and to capitalise that first word\nteacher: Mind you, the task does not prescribe it, but it sounds good and lets you show off your language, which is sometimes easier in this abstract context\nteacher: Ok, lovely, I've got to let you go! Great job with the writing, it's definitely a strong 'pass'\nstudent: Great! Thank you for the lesson and all the tips! I'll make sure to work on my grammar :.\nstudent: Have a nice day! As for the next lesson: next week, same time, same place?\nteacher: My pleasure! Yes, same time, same place if it suits you :.\nstudent: It does...perfect! Bye bye! Until next week :.\nteacher: Bye, have a nice week!",
    "student: Hi Mrs. Johnson.!\nteacher: Hi Isabella Jones!\nteacher: How are you today?\nstudent: Fine, thank you\nteacher: How's Kyiv? Is it getting nice and warm?\nstudent: I have had a yoga lesson and a meeting before the lesson.\nstudent: Oh, yesterday we had a warm day but a bit rainy\nstudent: But today it's colder\nteacher: Nice!\nteacher: Sounds like a busy morning!\nteacher: Have you got any nice plans for the weekend?\nstudent: And the forecast shows that we will have the same weather for the next 3 or 4 days\nteacher: Right, I see!\nstudent: Tomorrow maybe we will do something with John and Sophia at home. It's still lockdown here and the weathers will be rainy.\nteacher: Yes, of course, it makes sense!\nstudent: And on Sunday Sophia and John will go to Adrian's parents and Lena is coming to me to dye my hair at home\nstudent: Maybe you don't know\nteacher: Oh, Lena is coming over to dye your hair?\nteacher: good use of the verb 'dye' :.\nstudent: John's dad had covid\nstudent: and we haven't seen them for a long time\nteacher: Yes, you said! How is he feeling?\nstudent: I mean John's parents\nstudent: And on Tuesday John's mum has a surgery .\nstudent: And they really want to see Sophia\nstudent: John's dad is better, thank you\nstudent: not a very good blood test but we hope he will be better in two or three weeks\nstudent: Mrs. Johnson. : good use of the verb 'dye' :.  - thanks ..\nteacher: I hope he's better soon and everything goes smoothly with the surgery!\nstudent: *a surgery not an\nstudent: Thank you! xx\nstudent: how is the weather there in March?\nstudent: Rainy as usual?\nteacher: It's still very cold! Sunny and warm in the daytime and frosty at night.\nstudent: Or is it better and you can go out at the weekend?\nteacher: No, it hasn't rained for ages! I'm not sure what's going on\nstudent: hm, it's really strange\nteacher: I'd really like to go for a walk in the wood tomorrow. There should be bluebells (lovely blue flowers)\nteacher: And most importantly, I'll be looking for some wild garlic!\nteacher: #ERROR!\nstudent: Oh!\nstudent: Why do you need wild garlic? .\nteacher: cheremsha' :.\nstudent: For cooking?\nstudent: Ahhhhh\nstudent: \u0447\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0448\u0430!\nteacher: I'm going to make wild garlic pesto and a pie with some spinach and wild garlic, in filo pastry :.\nstudent: Yes, it's the season now\nteacher: Yes!\nteacher: But you can't buy it here like in Ukraine\nteacher: What do you make with it?\nstudent: but is it in the forest?\nstudent: Are you sure? .\nstudent: I'm not good at wild plants ..\nstudent: I'm\nteacher: Well, in Ukraine people probably grow it on their dachas :.\nteacher: But here it's a wild plant!\nstudent: But I know that if you would like to buy it it's still a quest\nstudent: you can buy it here just from babushkas .\nteacher: If you go out and gather some edible plants and mushrooms in the wild, it's called 'foraging'\nteacher: to forage for berries / mushrooms / wild garlic\nstudent: edible?\nteacher: Yes, I know! English babushkas don't grow wild garlic :....\nteacher: edible = suitable for eating\nteacher: the opposite is 'inedible'\nteacher: Mushrooms can be edible and inedible\nstudent: I've just checked the translation\nstudent: \u0444\u0443\u0440\u0430\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c ..\nstudent: Have you heard the word \u0444\u0443\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c ?\nstudent: ,\nstudent: ?\nteacher: I've never heard such a word!!\nstudent: Me neither\nstudent: .\nteacher: Me ____???\nstudent: Me didn't?\nteacher: Noo, 'me neither'\nstudent: Ah\nstudent: ok\nstudent: but I answered my question\nteacher: or 'Neither ____ I' .which verb goes in the gap?.\nstudent: not your expression\nstudent: Neither do I\nteacher: I've never heard this word.  - Me neither / Neither ___ I\nstudent: Did you hear the word \u0444\u0443\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c .? Me never\nstudent: Is it not right?\nteacher: No :. Have you heard the word ' '? I haven't.\nstudent: Ah\nstudent: ok\nstudent: So I didn't in that case?\nstudent: When I ask you and answer about me at the same time?\nteacher: You can say 'I didn't' if the question is in past simple .or 'I haven't' if it was in present perfect.\nteacher: \u0444\u0443\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c sounds horrible, anyway!\nstudent: I see\nstudent: you\nteacher: To forage is 'sobirat'', 'hodit' za (gribami)'\nstudent: I agree, it's a horrible word .\nstudent: I see\nstudent: thank you\nstudent: \u0444\u0443\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0433\u0440\u0438\u0431\u044b ..\nteacher: Foraging seems to be a new hobby here in the UK :.

I'm glad it's becoming popular in the UK.\nstudent: I don't like it\nstudent: sorry .\nteacher: No problem, you've got to be used to it I think :)\nteacher: Ok, shall we go back to the video about books?\nstudent: But I know lots of people who love foraging for mushrooms here in Ukraine\nteacher: Yes, definitely!\nstudent: But I don't like mushrooms at all .....\nteacher: Oh, wait a second. The pronunciation for the new words\nteacher: /\u02c8ed.\u0259.b\u0259l/\nstudent: I am an 'I don't like it' person.\nteacher: Which word is this? :)\nteacher: It's good to know what you like and don't like!\nstudent: for wild plants you can eat .\nteacher: I mean, could you spell the word for me?\nstudent: I like to buy berries and other food and go on a picnic .\nstudent: edible\nteacher: Yes! and /\u026a\u02c8ned.\u0259.b\u0259l/ ?\nteacher: I love going on a picnic too :.\nstudent: wow! I'm with you .\nstudent: here\nstudent: inedible\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: Edible / inedible is not just about wild plants, actually. Rocks are inedible but pasta is edible :.\nteacher: And metaphorically: I put too much salt in my soup, and it was practically inedible!\nteacher: This pasta is edible, but nothing special. (it's not very tasty but it's safe to eat)\nstudent: I see\nstudent: it's very clear\nstudent: .\nteacher: No problem :)\nteacher: /\u02c8f\u0252r.\u026ad\u0292/  ?\nstudent: forage\nteacher: Yes :)\nteacher: Ok, shall we go to our 'people in the street' talking about their favourite books?\nteacher: To make it a bit easier, I'll say that the first girl .Charlie. talks about 'Dear Zoo' .I don't know if you've heard of 'Dear Zoo'.\nstudent: Yes\nstudent: No, I haven't .\nstudent: Ok\nstudent: she was talking about something like\nstudent: a boy who got lost? animals through the post?\nteacher: It's a book for very young children, I think even Sophia will be too old for Dear Zoo :) I found a video of a lady reading it, I'll send it to you at the end of the class\nteacher: a boy who was getting animals through the post\nstudent: And she likes the plot because she had (would like to have) a dog?\nteacher: The book goes: I wrote to a zoo to send me a pet. They send me a lion. He was too fierce! I sent him back.\nteacher: And so on with  several animals, none of them is right, until they send him a dog\nstudent: aaaaah\nstudent: oooooh\nstudent: I see now .\nteacher: Yes, Charlie says, 'Growing up, my parents wouldn't let me have a pet, so it was a nice idea, lots of animals coming to stay...'\nstudent: I see\nstudent: Aha\nteacher: Oh, the next question has a nice expression. 'to identify with' = to feel a connection with\nteacher: for example, a character you can identify with = a character you like or think is like you\nstudent: Aha, I got it\nteacher: We can also identify with an idea, if we like / support the idea\nstudent: Aha, I see, thank you\nteacher: Or for example, someone says on TV, 'being in lockdown can be very lonely'. Many people can identify with this (they feel the same way)\nteacher: Charlie identifies with a girl from a book that she likes. Do you remember why she likes this girl?\nstudent: a girl? Not a boy?\nstudent: I'm quite confused about the video . Sorry .\nteacher: Yes, I think she talks about a girl!\nteacher: Sorry, the first speaker in the video!\nstudent: Ah, ok, I'm sorry\nstudent: I thought it was a boy .\nteacher: It's around 0:40\nteacher: if you've got the video handy\nstudent: I have\nstudent: Let me listen to it please\nteacher: Yes, sure!\nstudent: Ok\nstudent: I can't hear 100%, but\nstudent: then she talks about a girl from a book who was like a tomboy\nstudent: adventurous\nteacher: Yes! a 'tomboy' = a girl who behaves like a boy\nstudent: like Charlie was when she was a child\nstudent: Something like that\nteacher: a girl who acts and dresses like a boy and likes noisy physical activities\nteacher: says the dictionary\nstudent: I know the expression\nstudent: thank you\nteacher: I think Alexa Chung was talking about tomboy style (dressing like men, in casual clothes)\nstudent: but I didn't know how to spell it correctly\nteacher: Were you a tomboy when you were growing up?\nstudent: Yes! I think I know the expression from Alexa or from other interviews about style\nstudent: no, I wasn't\nstudent: I think neither were you\nstudent: Am I right? .\nteacher: Not really! But I liked running around, swimming and foraging :)\nstudent: ...\nstudent: I liked playing with boys but I wasn't a tomboy .\nteacher: I think tomboy is a bit of labelling. I mean, a girl should be able to run, be noisy and wear comfortable clothes without being called a boy! or a tomboy!\nteacher: Yes, that makes sense!\nstudent: Agree!\nstudent: Sophia likes cars for examble\nstudent: or to play with a ball\nstudent: And likes it so much\nteacher: Yes, of course! And Sophia likes lots of 'girl' stuff! On this feminist note, I'm going to wish you to have a lovely weekend :)\nstudent: thank you ))\nstudent: Have a good weekend too\nstudent: bye xx\nteacher: Thank you! I'll send you a picture of some wild garlic if I find any :)\nteacher: Bye! :)\nstudent: Oh! I will wait )\nteacher: Ok :))",
    "student: Hello Mrs. Taylor!\nstudent: Sorry for being late!\nteacher: Hi Emily!\nteacher: No problem\nteacher: How are you today?\nstudent: How are you?\nstudent: Today I'm very sleepy\nteacher: Oh no, not a good night?\nstudent: Ethan didn't let me sleep through the night\nstudent: Yep.\nteacher: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that!\nstudent: So everything I do feels like a slow-motion video..\nstudent: That's OK\nteacher: Yes, I know the feeling. Very hard!\nteacher: Are you nearly out of the lockdown?\nstudent: Another thing that's bugging me is how cold it is inside the house as compared to the outside ...\nstudent: Not yet, unfortunately.\nstudent: Maybe after all the May holidays\nteacher: Oh yes, it's definitely a phenomenon of this time of the year, isn't it?\nstudent: TRUE\nteacher: Oh really? I thought it was the end of April\nstudent: Every fall and spring...\nstudent: They will probably prolong it\nstudent: That's what I've been told\nteacher: What are May holidays like in Ukraine these days? If I remember correctly, it's not the 1,2 and 9 of May anymore!\nstudent: I'm happy we're out of Kyiv from May 7 to 11\nteacher: Right, I see! That would make most sense, it can't have made enough of a difference yet\nteacher: Nice! Where are you going?\nstudent: Not far. We're going to Vinnitsa\nstudent: The good part is it's not a red zone\nstudent: And there are shops and cafes open\nteacher: Oh yes, you go there every now and then, don't you? Have you got family there?\nteacher: Nice!\nstudent: And the restrictions are not so tight. They don't have high numbers of the infected, luckily.\nstudent: My in-laws live there\nstudent: Did I use it correctly?\nteacher: in-laws'? Absolutely\nstudent: Overall, Kyiv is a good place to be on May holidays, actually. The city is empty\nstudent: Thanks.\nteacher: Haha, yes, that must be true. Now that I'm thinking about it, I probably never spent May holidays in Kyiv. But I contributed to making it emptier! :.\nteacher: while living there I mean\nstudent: Right! You did a good job...\nteacher: I tried! :..\nteacher: How much time have you got today? Until 1 pm?\nstudent: Yes, until 1 pm\nstudent: sorry again for being late\nstudent: Maybe some grammar tests?\nteacher: No worries! I was planning to continue with 'speaking' questions, this time from the last part. They are more abstract than the questions from part 1 we tried last time, and we could brainstorm some nice vocabulary for them\nstudent: Oh no\nstudent: I'm afraid I'm too tired to be creative today\nteacher: Ok, fair enough!\nteacher: Let me re-plan quickly :.\nstudent: No problem.\nstudent: We can just talk if you want\nteacher: Ok, in this case let's take a bit of break from C2 proficiency, and do a bit of 'everyday English'\nstudent: OK\nteacher: I've been looking for some interesting real-life (as opposed to coming from a textbook) expressions, for you and my other C2 student\nteacher: And I turned to the comments to 'a most commented-on article' from the Guardian\nteacher: from a couple of months ago, admittedly\nstudent: I've got the book ready just in case (C2 Proficiency)\nstudent: Cool. What was the article about?\nteacher: The article was on a very English topic of class, as in working class, middle class and upper class. It's not something we think about a lot in Ukraine I would say, but it's certainly on the minds of English people (very anachronistic, I know)\nteacher: Oh, which book have you got?\nstudent: 168194-c2-proficiency-teachers-handbook-2\nteacher: Ah, ok, I'm with you, sorry\nstudent: Although classes exist in Ukraine too, I think\nteacher: Yes, in what way?\nteacher: The article discusses the tendency that some people in very middle-class jobs .a solicitor, for example. have, to claim that they are working class, e.g. because there granddad was a farmer\nstudent: Could you maybe send me the link after the class?\nstudent: In many ways. Although I was told the middle class does not exist in Ukraine. Only working and upper\nstudent: The way people live, the economic divide (if I could say so)\nstudent: economic* maybe\nteacher: Yes, very good correction! economic = related to the economy vs. economical = saving you money and resources\nteacher: an economical car is cheap to run, for example\nstudent: yes yes\nstudent: Slipped my mind\nteacher: No worries\nteacher: Well, in Ukraine there's definitely a political / financial elite\nteacher: But in the UK, the upper class basically means the aristocracy\nstudent: definitely\nteacher: You can't become upper class, only be born into it. Even if you marry into an upper-class family, arguably, you will still be seen as an odd one out or whatever\nteacher: like Meghan Markle :) pretty feudal stuff\nstudent: Nice inclusion..\nteacher: No inclusion at all :...\nstudent: It's sad\nteacher: It's horrible in my opinion, but this is 'good old England' to many here\nstudent: Right. People are very reluctant to change\nteacher: The distinction between working and middle class is much more fluid. Many people are born in working class families, but they put themselves through university, get a nice middle class job and socially climb\nteacher: Definitely. It's obvious from the popularity of shows like 'Downton Abbey' just how strong this spirit still is\nteacher: Anyway, to the yummy (languagewise) comments on the article! I'll send you the article later on, if you're curious\nstudent: Thank you\nteacher: I predict this will open a right can of worms.... I think part of the issue is that we don't live in an age any more where whether you are working class or middle class is a very clear cut and obvious thing. Fifty years ago you could have told by someone's dress, address, and job title. now, not so much. Being 'working class' no longer means you're going down the pit each day, and being middle class no longer means having a house in the suburbs and going to work in a suit, so it's no surprise that class has become less solidly defined and more about self perception.\nteacher: Are there any expressions that catch your eye?\nstudent: a can of worms haha\nstudent: solidly defined\nstudent: a clear cut\nteacher: Yes, my choices too!\nteacher: Yes, 'to open a can of worms', very intuitive, isn't it? :..\nstudent: Yes\nstudent: Very graphic ...\nteacher: Yep, if you've ever been fishing :..\nteacher: a clear cut .e.g. distinction. - also a very good expression!\nstudent: Oh, a couple of times. I watched my grandpa fish\nstudent: And he did have the can\nteacher: I actually never have, basically because of the image of the can of worms :....\nstudent: hahah\nstudent: You knew right away it wasn't worth it\nteacher: That's it! :...\nstudent: Never understood fishing..\nteacher: Oh, it's a sport here in the UK. In that, you don't keep the fish, you take it off the hook, put some antiseptic on and release it\nteacher: Oh, I forgot: you take a selfie with it first\nteacher: Do you know the word for it? Fishing as a sport rather than fishing for food\nstudent: Free fishing?.....\nteacher: angling!\nteacher: and the person who does it is an angler\nstudent: Interesting\nteacher: My friend's partner is a passionate angler, and he always corrects people if they say 'fishing' :...\nstudent: Do all anglers take pictures with the fish?\nteacher: Well, I can't say for all of them, but this seems to be the point... You catch a giant carp, take a picture holding it up gingerly and post it on anglers' forums\nteacher: And they scoff at local Poles who catch carp for their Christmas dinner...\nteacher: Ok, the next part of the same comment\nteacher: I've heard some (usually very middle class) people argue that anyone who works for a living and gets a salary is 'working class', which misses the whole point of the traditional definitions... The reasons that middle class people would try to play up proletarian origins seem accurate. I'd also add that people adjust their own perception based on what others around them think. Class, after all, being a social concept. If you are someone who works in an environment where everyone seems more or less privileged than you have been, that changes your perception of your own origins. I felt very middle class at school, because I probably was compared to many kids I went to school with. When I went to university, everyone was middle class and many were positively posh. Then I went into a career where my own background, whilst undoubtedly middle class, was humble compared to many people I worked with. Of COURSE that changes your perception of what your own class background is.\nstudent: play up proletarian origins\nstudent: positively posh\nteacher: Yes, play up / play down (downplay) - great phrasal verbs!\nteacher: Well, downplay isn't a pharasal verb, but play down certainly is, with the same meaning\nteacher: I wouldn't say 'positively posh' is a set collocation, but it does sound nice :.\nstudent: Oh yes. It reminded me of Posh Spice..\nteacher: Ok, I'll send you the article if you're curious, and we can continue with the comments next week .even though I guess we'll need to adjust the date and time because of holidays!.. I really appreciate you showing up despite being exhausted! Hope you can have a power nap and a restful night!\nteacher: Oh yes, 'posh' is such an interesting word, usually meaning 'expensive and middle-class' in England\nteacher: Some holiday places, shops and supermarkets can be described as posh\nteacher: a posh accent, too!\nteacher: i.e. revealing that the person went to a posh school, comes from a posh family, etc. :.\nstudent: Probably many brands try to use it in their slogans\nstudent: The word 'posh' I mean\nteacher: Hmm, I would say it's more of a word that people who are not posh use to describe things that are expensive and of very high quality\nstudent: Thank you for the lesson. Sorry I'm not myself today..\nstudent: Oh really\nteacher: No worries at all, sorry you're not feeling well!\nstudent: So posh people don't say they are posh\nstudent: haha\nteacher: Exactly!!\nstudent: Got it!\nstudent: It's funny\nteacher: You can actually hear a lot of people saying 'I know I sound posh, but I'm not posh!'\nstudent: ahha\nteacher: meaning that they speak in a posh accent, but (they think!) they are very humble :)\nstudent: is posh close to snob?\nteacher: Hmmm, good question! 'a snob' implies looking down on others, which maybe true or not for someone who is posh!\nteacher: I've got to dig up some nice English satire, which is often aimed at posh people, to give you a better idea! I'll have a good think!\nstudent: Deal!\nstudent: Ok Mrs. Taylor! I'm going to leave. Thank you again!\nteacher: I'm aware that I've been describing 'posh' by repeating 'posh posh posh'\nteacher: Sure! Talk to you soon!\nstudent: haha. No that's fine\nstudent: See you! Take care",
    "student: Hello!\nteacher: Hi Leah Smith!\nstudent: How are you?\nteacher: A bit stressed because my laptop's playing up! I've been battling with it for the last hour, to get it ready for the lesson. But I'm still on my phone now, sorry if my responses are taking longer, I hope it'll come round soon!\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: Sorry to hear that...unfortunately technology is wonderful only as long as it works, then it becomes a hassle...I hope you'll be able to fix it soon!\nteacher: Me too, thank you! Yes, exactly!\nstudent: I am fine, thank you! The weekend was nice and warm...my only complaint is that now we are back to cold, humid, winter-like days...\nstudent: Now it's 6 degrees...which is definitely not what I expect at the end of April...\nteacher: 6 degrees?! Oh no, this is worse than England!\nteacher: So frustrating, especially if you come from a sunnier land. The locals don't seem to mind as much in my experience\nstudent: Well, to be honest they are complaining a bit, because spring is supposed to be a wonderful season here...\nteacher: But we can't seem to get out of this cold winter, yes!\nteacher: Annoyingly, all the materials I prepared for today are on my laptop. We'll see what state it's going to be in after a reboot in a moment\nstudent: We had a few days when it was almost too hot (we reached more than 22 degrees during the day), so it almost looks like nature is playing us\nstudent: Okay, I'll wait, no problem\nteacher: But my plan was to address a couple of things I've noticed while annotating our chats (minor) and finish that C2 Use of English paper. Then next time we can look at linkers for writing and another writing task\nstudent: Nice :)\nteacher: Ok, cool! Let's start with what I've got in my notebook\nteacher: I've noticed a few instances where the word order in the chats doesn't seem very natural to me\nteacher: For example, with adjectives\nteacher: Did you know, when there are multiple adjectives in front of a noun, there's actually a rule that regulates their order?\nteacher: Intuitive to natives, but helpful to people like you and me\nstudent: Yes and no...\nstudent: I mean, I know there is a rule, but I wouldn't know which rule it is...\nstudent: Btw, I don't know who User67... is\nteacher: Yaay! I'm on my laptop\nteacher: It's me on my laptop\nstudent: Great!\nteacher: One moment, I'll shut down the chatroom on my phone\nteacher: Ah, this is better! Fingers crossed it works!\nteacher: I'm becoming superstitious with this laptop...\nstudent: Yes!\nstudent: Haha...I am not sure it works, but I can understand if it regularly gives you problems...\nstudent: *problems\nteacher: Ok, could you put this adjectives into the right order? Panettone is a (Easter, Italian, delicious, round) cake.\nteacher: *these\nstudent: Okay...so, if I ignore the shape word I would write: Panettone is a delicious Easter Italian cake.\nstudent: But if I have to use the shape...maybe I'd write 'Panettone is a delicious Easter Italian round cake' but it definitely reads wrong to me\nteacher: Yes, it does a bit. But delicious definitely takes the first place because it's an opinion adjective\nteacher: The order is: 1. opinion  2. size  3. physical quality (thin, rough, untidy)  4. shape 5.age 6. colour 7. origin 8. material 9. type 10. purpose\nstudent: oh, okay...I am pretty sure that I have never heard the words 'opinion adjectives', even though I think I understand what you mean (an adjective describing a personal opinion, i.e., something that depends on your judgment or personal opinion)\nstudent: delicious round Italian Easter\nteacher: Yes, exactly, they can be as simple as 'delicous', 'beautiful', 'cool', 'good' etc.\nteacher: absolutely!\nstudent: I am having a bit of a difficulty trying to fit 'Easter' in those categories...\nstudent: great! I'll write these down\nteacher: opinion shape origin type / purpose\nstudent: If I have more adjectives falling in the same category then the order isn't that important among them?\nteacher: Ok, how would you put these in order, please? (room, a, circular, large)\nteacher: Yes, especially if you have several opinion adjectives\nstudent: a large circular room\nteacher: Some books insist that we go from a more general to a more specific opinion\nteacher: He's a nice helpful young man.\nteacher: Yes, correct!\nteacher: a, bamboo, wonderful, old, table\nstudent: a wonderful old bamboo table\nstudent: opinion/age/material\nteacher: Sorry, my laptop froze again! I hope you haven't been waiting long\nteacher: Yes, correct!\nteacher: Dutch, middle-aged, well-known, a, businessman\nstudent: I was suspecting that, no problem\nstudent: a well-known middle-aged Dutch businessman\nteacher: Yes, correct!\nteacher: Lovely, ok. I've also noticed that sometimes the word 'also' creeps up in unusual places in the chat\nstudent: I will have to memorize that list, because with every example so far I could quickly order 2 out of 3 adjectives (but I had to check the rule for the next one)\nteacher: Oh I see, fair enough! Thanks for letting me know how it is for you, I'll make a note that we need to practice this a bit more\nstudent: Maybe the German 'also' is to blame here, but please show me some examples\nteacher: Yes, I thought it was the 'auch' interference :. or something from Italian\nteacher: For example, a while back a complained that it was cold in England, and you said\nteacher: Also here it is cold, but it should get colder at the end of the week.\nstudent: Here too it is cold, ....\nstudent: I guess I wanted to say something like that...\nteacher: I would say, if the idea is 'In Austria it's cold as well as in England', also would go just before cold\nstudent: But I am not sure of what would be the most 'fluent' way to say it\nteacher: Here it's also cold!\nstudent: Okay...\nstudent: Here it is also like that...\nstudent: I see\nteacher: But, if you were telling me several things about Austria...\nteacher: Austria is less affected by the Mediterranean. The climate is temperate. Also, here it is cold.\nteacher: for example, not sure if it's true\nteacher: But the point is, with 'Also,' at the front of the sentence, you're adding another idea to what you've said before\nteacher: e.g. Guinea pigs are really low-maintenance as far as pets go. Also, they are affectionate and gentle.\nteacher: compare with:\nteacher: Rabbits are affectionate and gentle. Guinea pigs are also very loving pets!\nstudent: I see...so the idea is that, when it is at the beginning of a sentence, it needs 'something' before, to which it adds new information.\nteacher: Yes, that's right!\nteacher: Ok, let's have a quick look at another example\nteacher: I said something about the South African variant of covid. You say:\nteacher: - Yes, I have heard also of that mutation..\nteacher: If you're stressing that you heard of it as well as I did, I would move 'also' to just before 'heard'\nteacher: Yes, I have also heard of that mutation\nstudent: I see... or I could simply avoid using 'also'\nstudent: If I don't want to stress anything in particular\nteacher: Yes, you could do without it, true\u00ac\nteacher: !\nteacher: Does it make sense to you? Does it sound more natural this way?\nstudent: Yes, it does...\nstudent: this last example definitely comes from the Italian word order\nstudent: The structure should be, for example, I have also (What I have heard/done/etc.) right?\nstudent: *right?\nteacher: Ok, interesting!\nstudent: For example I have also talked with him.\nstudent: In Italian word order is often flexible, in this case you might put 'anche' (which roughly translates to 'also') both before and after the verb heard, but if put before it gives a stronger stress to what comes after it...\nteacher: Yes, basically, also goes with the word that you're adding to something else\nteacher: I've had a cup of tea with him. I've also talked to him. (you're adding 'talk' here)\nstudent: Okay, thank you for the clarification!\nteacher: It's quite hard to present a clear cut rule here, as 'also' can jump about in the sentence, depending on what you're stressing!\nteacher: Ok, how about 'often'? could you insert 'often' in this sentence, please?\nteacher: I've wondered whether there's life on Mars\nstudent: I've often wondered whether there's life on Mars\nteacher: Yes! good!\nstudent: Even though it is easier now that I know what I have to be especially careful about ;.\nteacher: Yes, I've made a note while annotating: often, really, also. Now I can't remember what the problems were with often and really :.\nteacher: But it's about them popping up in uncharacteristic places\nstudent: I see... I'll take a mental note of this...\nteacher: Ah, we haven't got much time left for the C2 paper! Still, I think we managed to do some useful stuff today. Shall we say same time next week? And if you have any questions you'd like us to look into, feel free to say so!\nteacher: Otherwise, we'll look at linkers next time\nstudent: That's okay with me...see you next week at the same time then!\nstudent: Thank you and have a wonderful day!\nteacher: Lovely, thank you, you too! Sorry about all the technical troubles today\nstudent: No problem, see you next Tuesday!\nteacher: Bye :)",
    "student: Hi Ms. Patel\nstudent: .\nteacher: Hi Elena Parker!\nteacher: Is everything ok with the program for you?\nstudent: Sorry for the spam .\nstudent: It looks like the program isn't working properly today\nteacher: Oh no! Is it working now? It's fine on my side at the moment\nstudent: It's ok now\nstudent: how are you?\nteacher: That's good!\nteacher: I'm fine, thank you! I'm doing a lot of gardening, it's the right time to sow seeds and plant. So I'm really enjoying myself!\nteacher: Oh, and a bit of good news. David Smith's having his first jab on Monday!\nstudent: Wow!\nteacher: Yes, we're so excited!\nstudent: What does it mean, sow?\nstudent: And jab? .\nteacher: When we sow seeds, we put them in the soil and water them, and hope that they will grow :.\nstudent: sorry it's something new for me .\nteacher: /s\u0259\u028a/\nteacher: to sow - sowed -sowed .or sown.\nteacher: I'm doing a lot of sowing at the moment: sunflowers, courgettes, pumpkins, sweetcorn etc.\nteacher: We talked about the word 'jab' a while ago I think. Children get regular jabs to protect them against serious diseases. Some people have a flu jab every autumn. And now, more and more people are getting a covid jab!\nteacher: Remember?\nstudent: Ahhh\nstudent: Remember now!\nstudent: It's good news\nteacher: Yes, it was a bit out of context, sorry!\nteacher: Yes, it's great news!\nstudent: Is it like a special program for university staff?\nstudent: Do you know the name of the vaccine?\nteacher: No, they are rolling it out to everyone who is over 40 at the moment. So of cource, he booked his jab as soon as could!\nstudent: Ah! I see\nteacher: No, it could be one of the three vaccines (AstraZeneca, Pfizer or Moderna), but we don't know which one\nteacher: *of course\nstudent: So the next step is people aged 30-40 I think?\nteacher: Well, I think it'll be the over 35s first\nteacher: That's what they did with the over 40s. First they invited the over-45s, then everyone who is 44, and now the over 40s\nstudent: I know that Isabella's grandfather has been offered a Pfizer jab\nstudent: He is 94 now\nteacher: Nice! That's good to know!\nteacher: How are you guys doing? What's new with you?\nstudent: But Isabella doesn't know what to do because she is not sure if he has any \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0439\nteacher: Ah, let me remember this word!\nteacher: It's supposed to be quite safe, the vaccine\nstudent: Right now it has been announced that from the 1st of May we won't have a lockdown anymore\nteacher: The word is a contraindication\nstudent: Oh, thank you\nstudent: It's a huge word )\nteacher: Exactly like in Russian. contra = \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043e indication = \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\nteacher: Yes, but it makes sense if you think about it. Still, you don't have to learn it, it's quite low frequency!\nteacher: Ok, I see! Is this good news? About the end of the lockdown? Or does it make you feel unsafe?\nstudent: sorry\nstudent: I'm here\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: I thought something might be wrong!\nstudent: I'm not sure about my feelings\nstudent: you know that we have Easter next Sunday\nteacher: Yes, sure\nstudent: and it's a big holiday here\nstudent: so I think it's more like a political decision\nstudent: Because people would like to celebrate and to see their families and friends\nteacher: Oh no, but it means lots of people will go to churches and they might pass the virus to each other :( I haven't thought about it!\nstudent: I'm not sure that the situation with Covid is much better now\nteacher: Right, the government wants to be popular instead of doing the right thing!\nteacher: Sounds like it to me\nstudent: It looks that way to me\nstudent: And you know\nteacher: Awful :(\nstudent: I'm sure that after Easter the number of cases will increase\nteacher: Yes, I agree with you, unfortunately\nstudent: Because Easter is such a big family holiday here\nteacher: Have you got any nice plans for the holiday? I do understand that you're probably quite limited in what you can do\nteacher: Yes, sure!\nstudent: I'm not sure\nstudent: Yesterday Michael's mum had a surgery you know\nteacher: Oh yes, of course! Is she ok?\nstudent: And after the surgery there will be a course of treatment\nstudent: but it depends on the results of different tests\nteacher: Right, I see\nstudent: So we can't plan anything now\nstudent: Maybe we will meet with my mum and my brother's family and organize a picnic\nteacher: I see, it's a difficult time for you! I'm sorry to hear that!\nstudent: But we aren't 100% sure  now\nteacher: Got that\nstudent: It's ok, sometimes it happens, we can't control things like that\nteacher: Ok, I've got something to listen to for you today, that is the topic we discussed earlier. Eye health!\nstudent: Ok .\nteacher: Yes, we wish we could have some control, but we don't!\nteacher: Are you here?\nstudent: I'm here!\nteacher: Ok, sure, it just said 'Elena Parker left the room'\nstudent: I see\nstudent: I don't know why .\nteacher: Not just eye health, but something called 'eye yoga'. Have you ever heard about eye yoga?\nstudent: I have heard about some eye gymnastics maybe it is something similar .\nteacher: Yes, it the 'eye exercises' in Ukraine! That's what I thought about too\nteacher: hear - hearD - hearD\nstudent: I have heard\nteacher: Yes, cool :)\nteacher: Ok, just a couple of words before you listen / watch\nteacher: If we are experiencing 'eye strain', our eyes are tired and hurt, probably from looking at screens for too long\nstudent: I see!\nteacher: Yes, eye strain is not a pleasant feeling! You said you feel it quite often, don't you?\nteacher: Ok, if we're 'short-sighted', we see objects close to us clearly but have trouble seeing in the distance\nteacher: /\u02cc\u0283\u0254\u02d0t\u02c8sa\u026a.t\u026ad/\nteacher: And if we're 'long-sighted', it's the opposite! We see faraway objects ok, but we have trouble reading a book without glasses\nstudent: Yes, but now I feel better because of a lens and my glasses\nstudent: I see, thank you\nteacher: Yes, because of your contact lens\nteacher: That's good!\nstudent: in Ukrainian and Russian we have quite similar expressions\nstudent: my contact lens, yes!\nteacher: Yes, of course! You know what, I haven't thought about it :)\nteacher: Ok, I'm going to send you the link. Could you watch the video (but not read the text under the video) and say whether the doctor from an eye hospital believes eye yoga can fix some eye problems\nstudent: ok!\nteacher: Have you watched it?\nstudent: yes\nstudent: ok\nteacher: Ok! So what did the doctor think?\nstudent: The doctor said that the exercises can't treat some anatomical eye problems\nteacher: Yes, he was quite sceptical about eye yoga, wasn't he? :)\nstudent: So it looks like eye yoga can just help people to make their eyes more relaxed\nteacher: Exactly!  Well done!\nstudent: Yes, he was.\nteacher: The eye yoga teacher talked about 'reversing' some eye problems. Do you know 'reverse'? Like when a car reverses\nstudent: to turn?\nteacher: to turn back\nteacher: No, sorry, in case of a car, to 'go back', without turning actually\nstudent: aha\nteacher: But if there is a problem with someone's eyes and then the problem goes away completely, the problem is reversed\nstudent: \u0437\u0430\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0445\u043e\u0434\nstudent: I see now .\nteacher: Yes, but it's a verb :)\nstudent: I prefer to believe the doctor not the yoga teacher ..\nteacher: It can be a legal term as well. The Court of Appeal reversed the previous judgment.\nteacher: For example\nstudent: like \u0432\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0443\u043b \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435?\nteacher: I don't know what the term is in Russian actually! For example, the court decided that someone was guilty, but then the court of appeal said they were not guilty\nteacher: Is that it? vernul?\nstudent: aha\nstudent: I see\nstudent: \u0432\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0443\u043b is not a legal term but more literary .\nteacher: Got that! I trust your superior knowledge :)\nstudent: ))\nteacher: Ok, are we talking again at 3.20 pm tomorrow? Is that right?\nstudent: Yes!\nstudent: thank you for the lesson!\nteacher: Ok, lovely! If you have some time, feel free to watch the video again and read the script, maybe you'll have some questions. But if not, that's fine!\nstudent: I will try!\nteacher: It's my pleasure, speak to you tomorrow!\nstudent: Thank you\nstudent: Have a good day .\nteacher: You too! Bye :))\nstudent: See you tomorrow\nstudent: bye xx",
    "student: Hi Mr. James Thompson!\nteacher: Hi Kevin :.\nstudent: I'm here\nstudent: Sorry\nteacher: How are you?\nteacher: No worries!\nstudent: Fine, thank you\nteacher: Are you having a busy day?\nstudent: today the weather here is lovely, finally\nstudent: We are without the nanny today so we are together with Aidan all day\nteacher: Oh good for you! Sadly, I can't say the same\nteacher: Nice!\nstudent: We had a long walk\nstudent: In Mariinsky park\nteacher: Sounds wonderful\nteacher: I've heard it's still very cold in Kyiv. It must have changed!\nstudent: Played with a plastic bag hahaha\nstudent: Sometimes plastic is not so bad ..\nstudent: Even yesterday it was cold, but the day before yesterday I felt like it was winter .\nteacher: Haha, well, sometimes simple things are the best toys!\nteacher: I see! Hopefully, May will be lovely, with chestnut trees in blossom!\nstudent: Yeah!\nstudent: Now it's just the beginning of blossoms\nteacher: Beautiful!\nstudent: is it the right expression? .\nteacher: it's just ___ beginning of blossoms\nstudent: the?\nstudent: a?\nstudent: )\nteacher: the :) Generally, if you have a phrase with 'of' after a noun, it's likely to be 'the' before the noun\nstudent: aha\nteacher: But not always!\nstudent: I see\nstudent: thank you\nstudent: as usual not always ))\nteacher: This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship'\nteacher: like in Casablanca :)\nstudent: )))\nteacher: But: a pair of sneakers / trousers\nstudent: I see\nstudent: but it could be THE pair sometimes?\nstudent: like that pair?\nstudent: my pair?\nteacher: Yes, the pair of sneakers I told you about (for example)\nteacher: as in 'this pair of sneakers'\nteacher: Ok, and while we are here. 'Is this ___ right expression?'\nstudent: a right expression&amp;\nstudent: ?\nstudent: is it a right expression - not right? .\nteacher: the right expression; with the word 'right' it sounds like 'the only right one', like it's something unique. Obviously, in a language there can be many ways to say the same thing. But with the word 'right' 'the' is good.\nteacher: e.g. This is the right house. Have you got the right key? etc.\nstudent: I see\nstudent: thank you\nstudent: so the only one right\nstudent: I'll try to remember\nteacher: Yes, the word 'right' asks for 'the' :.\nteacher: What's Aidan doing now?\nstudent: She is sleeping now\nteacher: Oh nice! She is having a ____\nstudent: It's quite late for a nap, but it works well with my lesson .\nstudent: a nap\nteacher: Nap! That's right, you remember :)\nteacher: I thought we could revise some of our words from the past lessons today\nstudent: So I can't even say she is sleeping now in that case?\nteacher: Yes, of course you can! I was just trying to see if you remember the word\nstudent: Ah! Ok! Thank you .\nteacher: Ok then! a bit of revision\nstudent: Oh\nstudent: I'm sorry\nteacher: Yes?\nstudent: before I forget\nstudent: Maybe it's better to cancel the Monday lesson next week\nstudent: it's a bank holiday here so we will be without the nanny too .\nteacher: Yes, sure, it'll work for me too because it's bank holiday Monday in the UK\nstudent: Ah! Of course!\nstudent: You told me\nteacher: Here as well, at least we're having a holiday on the same day for once :)\nstudent: haha\nteacher: We'll do Friday at the usual time next week then?\nstudent: I'm going to dye some eggs with some red cabbage .\nstudent: Or dye?\nteacher: Wow! What an ambitious plan!\nstudent: Yes, Friday usual time!\nteacher: an ambitious plan' was an expression I was going to revise with you today :...\nstudent: haha\nstudent: ok, so I have an ambitious plan\nstudent: to talk with you about Easter and not revise the words ..\nteacher: Hmm, I think 'dye' in this case. But then you could 'paint' them with a paintbrush\nteacher: Fair enough! :))\nstudent: it was a joke ))\nteacher: They come out blue, don't they? We tried some natural dyes for eggs a couple of years ago\nteacher: Red cabbage, onion peel and turmeric I think\nstudent: Yeah! I tried the method before\nteacher: Separately, not altogether\nstudent: I tried also red with beetroot\nstudent: and yellow with curcuma\nteacher: turmeric :)\nteacher: turmeric = curcuma\nstudent: but it doesn't work as well as the red cabbage .\nstudent: Yes! Of course\nstudent: turmeric!\nteacher: /\u02c8t\u025c\u02d0.m\u0259r.\u026ak/\nteacher: Oh yes, you need quite a lot of turmeric to get some colour out of it as I remember\nstudent: yes. but it still doesn't dye \u0440\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e .\nstudent: Ah! Actually\nteacher: No, it doesn't give a uniform colour! (like a school uniform = everyone's the same)\nstudent: Your sister has written a very interesting article about Easter in Ukraine and in Russia\nstudent: For our website\nteacher: Oh did she? I'll check it out, thanks\nstudent: You can find it on ALMA School website or on our Facebook page .\nteacher: But even if the colour is not perfect, I just e...... imperfection :.\nteacher: Remember this word? meaning 1. hug; meaning 2. accept\nstudent: uniform color - what a nice expression . I like it\nstudent: accept imperfection?\nteacher: Not quite! embrace\nteacher: Remember?\nstudent: Ah\nstudent: I see\nstudent: sorry\nteacher: When I saw my old friend, she embraced me warmly\nteacher: a pre-pandemic example...\nstudent: I didn't understand the exercise\nteacher: Sorry! When a leave a gap (_____), I usually expect a student to fill it in. This time, I wanted to give you the first letter, so I did 'e......'\nstudent: I see now\nstudent: sorry\nstudent: it is my fault\nstudent: You made it very clear.\nteacher: Sometimes I don't want to tidy up / make Olivia put his toys away, I put him to bed and sit among his toys with a glass of wine and watch TV. I embrace chaos!\nstudent: I remember the meaning\nstudent: thank you!\nteacher: Cool! Oh, I wanted to give you a couple of examples with 'uniform' as an adjective from Cambridge English Dictionary\nteacher: The office walls and furniture are a uniform grey.\nstudent: ok!\nteacher: This is not about your office :)\nstudent: haha ))\nteacher: Small businesses are demanding that they receive uniform treatment from the banks.\nteacher: As you can see, uniform = the same in this case\nstudent: I see\nstudent: thank you\nstudent: so I can use uniform like the same?\nteacher: In this case, yes. But we can't say, for example, these children have uniform toys. They have the same toys!\nstudent: I see\nstudent: ok\nteacher: The uniform is a low-frequency word compared to 'the same'\nstudent: I see .\nteacher: While we're on 'low-' and 'high-'. What do we call something that requires a lot of time and resources? e.g. A short haircut is very high-m....... because you have to go to the hairdresser's every 4 weeks\nteacher: The spelling is quite challenging, so just say so if you don't remember :)\nstudent: high maintenance\nteacher: Yaay, well done!\nteacher: Ok, back to Easter! Are you going to bake some kulichi as well?\nstudent: no kulichi here\nstudent: be careful\nstudent: just paski .\nstudent: no, I won't\nteacher: No? Is it a Russian word? Sorry!\nteacher: Tell me, please!\nteacher: because I thought it was the other way round!\nstudent: it's too time-consuming\nstudent: right? )\nteacher: it's too time-c....... :)\nstudent: yes! If you say kulich here, you look like a Russian here and people will hate you (??) even if they are good )\nstudent: time-consuming! \u042d\u0432\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430! ..\nteacher: Oh no! This is weird, I always thought 'kulich' was Ukrainian, my mistake!\nteacher: I'll stay away from Kyiv around Easter time in the future :)\nstudent: I saw lots of arguments about kulichi and paski here on Fb etc.\nstudent: So be careful )\nteacher: Eureka! :)\nstudent: Eureka! )\nteacher: /ju\u02c8ri\u02d0.k\u0259/ (stress on the second syllable)\nstudent: Oh, thank you!\nteacher: You know what, I'm sure Olia Hercules uses 'kulichi' in her book even though she uniformly (!) uses Ukrainian words\nteacher: Could it be that 'kulich' is in the south of Ukraine?\nstudent: so here we have Paskha as Easter and paska as a dish\nteacher: That's right!\nstudent: I think it could be\nstudent: But I'm not sure\nstudent: Jessica Smith even wrote about it in the article\nstudent: But I asked her to \u0438\u0441\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c  this part\nteacher: But yes, baking Ukrainian panettone is time-consuming and doesn't always work. You have to be quite brave to try it. Or, as Alexa Chung would say, it's not for the faint-hearted! (remember this one?)\nteacher: to remove / delete this part\nteacher: Oh yes, I see, it's too divisive!\nstudent: Because I don't want our article to become a subject of arguments\nteacher: Yes, you don't want it to be divisive - a good word\nteacher: Do you know 'divide' as a verb?\nstudent: very good word\nstudent: I didn't know it before\nstudent: I know divide\nstudent: didn't remember faint-hearted\nstudent: But now I do .\nteacher: Yes, so if a topic / comment is divisive, it has the potential to cause a conflict\nteacher: Like politics, climate change, the BLM movement, covid vaccines - anything that's important :)\nstudent: BLM?\nteacher: Zelenskiy :) or at least he used to be divisive\nteacher: Black Lives Matter\nteacher: /d\u026a\u02c8va\u026a.s\u026av/\nstudent: Ah, I see now\nstudent: he is still divisive )\nteacher: Right, I will remember that too for my next trip to Kyiv :))\nstudent: Do you mean Zelensky? )\nteacher: Haha, yes, even the spelling can be divisive!\nteacher: like Kyiv vs. Kiev I suppose\nteacher: Ok, I've got a few more words to revise on my list! What do you call a machine that does the laundry?\nstudent: Yes! The spelling in this case is sooooo important .\nteacher: Yes, I agree! I always write 'Kyiv'\nstudent: washing machine .\nstudent: Mr. James Thompson : Yes, I agree! I always write 'Kyiv'  - good girl! .\nteacher: Yes, well done! And what about the one that does the dishes?\nstudent: haha\nteacher: Haha, I try!\nstudent: I've predicted it )\nstudent: don't remember\nteacher: a dishwasher\nstudent: but something different\nstudent: Aha! Thank you!\nteacher: a dishwasher and a washing machine :)\nstudent: I will remember\nstudent: maybe\nstudent: ))\nteacher: And if we haven't got a dishwasher, we have to do the dishes by hand\nteacher: No worries, this is the point of revision\nstudent: \u044b\u0443\u0443\nstudent: I see\nstudent: thank you!\nteacher: Oh goodness! I should have let you go 7 minutes ago!\nstudent: it's ok\nteacher: I thought it was 3.20-4.20 pm\nteacher: sorry!\nstudent: Is it ok for you?\nteacher: Ok, have a lovely holiday!\nstudent: Thank you\nstudent: you too\nteacher: I've got to go pick up Olivia in a minute :)\nstudent: Bye xx\nteacher: Bye! :)\nstudent: run! ))\nteacher: Will do!",
    "student: hi\nteacher: Hi Natalie Jones!\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: I am fine\nstudent: and you?\nteacher: Good, thank you\nteacher: Are you looking forward to the Easter holiday?\nstudent: well, I am looking forward just to eating some nice food\nteacher: Nice! Like what for example?\nstudent: kulichi.\nteacher: Haha, yes, I can imagine :)\nteacher: Ok, remember our phrases from the previous lesson? The most annoying / frustrating / exciting / interesting thing about .... is...\nstudent: yes\nteacher: The thing I hate / love / enjoy most about .... is ....\nteacher: The upside / downside (of something) is that....\nteacher: One of the advantages / disadvantages is that...\nteacher: Can you make several sentences about what's going on for you? Maybe Easter, or something about school - whatever you want!\nstudent: The thing I dislike is that every year at Easter we visit my grandma and we eat too much food!\nstudent: is that*\nteacher: Ok, sure! I can see how it can be frustrating. *at Easter\nstudent: One of the disadvantages is that I can't eat only the top part of kulich and I dislike raisins\nteacher: Aah, I see! You only like the icing?\nstudent: yes!\nteacher: You wouldn't like many English desserts then. There are often quite a lot of raisins and sultanas in them!\nstudent: for me kulich is dry without the icing, especially with raisins\nteacher: Yes, my solution has always been butter :)\nteacher: I mean, I just spread lots of butter on slices of kulich\nstudent: The thing I am worried about is that I don't really believe in God and I have to celebrate Easter\nstudent: nice\nstudent: I think I should try that\nteacher: Yes, I recommend!\nteacher: Yes, I get that too! We're not very religious, and yet Christmas and Easter are celebrated. It's part of a tradition!\nteacher: *We're not very religious either, I meant\nstudent: like I am not an atheist, maybe you don't know but there is such a thing as an agnostic, that means that you don't really know whether there is a god or not\nteacher: Yes, I know of course. You're leaving some room for what you can't prove / disprove\nteacher: ...you don't really know _____ ____ _____ a God or not\nstudent: yeah, I think it is about me\nstudent: oy\nstudent: forgot to type if\nstudent: if there  is\nteacher: Yes, well done!\nteacher: Good writing Natalie Jones, well done!\nteacher: How many days off are you having? Just next Monday?\nstudent: and Tuesday I think\nstudent: yes\nstudent: we go back to school on Wednesday\nteacher: That's an upside to the whole Easter thing, isn't it? :)\nstudent: yes\nteacher: We're having a holiday too, it's called a bank holiday Monday. The first and the last Mondays in May are bank holidays\nstudent: but it is not only because of Easter, tomorrow is the first of May\nteacher: Oh yes, sure! Labour Day\nteacher: Ok, I'd like us to talk about food today, but not the traditional type like kulichi :)\nteacher: As you probably know, the food industry is both creating and facing many environmental problems\nteacher: Do you know much about this? How food production may be harmful to the environment?\nstudent: well, not much\nteacher: Well, to create fields to grow food for humans and animals, people cut down forests, which is very bad for the planet\nstudent: yeah\nteacher: Also, the livestock people farm .livestock = cows, sheep, pigs etc.. require a lot of fresh water and resources and create a lot of gases that are harmful for the environment\nteacher: Just some of the problems!\nteacher: And of course, some people believe it's cruel to farm and kill animals\nteacher: Finally, the number of people on this planet is still growing, and we will need to feed more and more people.\nteacher: I wonder if you've ever heard of any 'foods of the future'? Something that might be a solution?\nstudent: I haven't heard about it, but I am interested in what you will tell me\nteacher: Ok sure :)\nteacher: Just a few words before we start!\nteacher: I mean, before I give you a link\nteacher: So again, livestock (plural noun) = all the animals that are farmed for food\nteacher: For example, I have a productive kitchen garden, but I haven't got any livestock, not even chickens :)\nteacher: Ok, maybe you know the name for very simple (biologically) plants that grow in or near water?\nstudent: no.\nteacher: It's called 'alga'  /\u02c8\u00e6l\u00b7\u0261\u0259/\nteacher: or 'algae' /\u02c8\u00e6l\u00b7d\u0292i/ in plural\nteacher: Seaweed is a type of algae! Have you ever tried seaweed?\nstudent: I think yes\nteacher: Well, nori in sushi is made out of seaweed I think\nteacher: Algae can be very nutritious!\nteacher: Ok, lovely. I'm going to send you a link to the article. It's a list of futuristic foods and ways of eating. Not all of them are foods! Could you read quickly and write here, which of them are new foods\nteacher: https://brightside.me/wonder-curiosities/10-high-tech-foods-we-will-be-eating-in-the-future-414010/\nstudent: coffee cubes\nstudent: coffee*\nstudent: DNA-based diet\nstudent: edible water bottles\nstudent: Self-decomposing food packages\nstudent: 3D-printed living food\nstudent: Algae: growing your own food when breathing\nteacher: Ok, anything else?\nstudent: the others aren't new\nteacher: What about the lab-grown meat? That's pretty new, isn't it?\nstudent: I think it is sold in some shops\nteacher: Really? The future is here!\nteacher: Which of them do you think is the most promising / exciting food?\nstudent: like it is not very good\nstudent: GOOD meat from a lab is new\nteacher: Well, they are working on it! In fact, I've read that in Israel there is a restaurant that grows its own chicken meat in a lab, and it tastes like good chicken! But no chickens are killed\nteacher: Yes, I suppose\nteacher: Ok, which one do you think is the most promising technology?\nstudent: chewable coffee\nteacher: Ok, you know what I'm going to say - why?\nstudent: \u61c8because even now there are a lot of different coffee candies\nteacher: Ok, would you be excited to try chewable coffee?\nstudent: yes\nstudent: why not\nstudent: maybe it would be tasty\nteacher: What about insects?\nstudent: be tasty\nstudent: NO\nteacher: No?\nstudent: I would never try them\nteacher: They are eaten in lots of parts of the world, but I'm with you here. I'm not used to food like this either!\nstudent: of course in China or other countries insects can be eaten\nteacher: What about algae-based foods?\nstudent: It is strange\nstudent: I don't think it is possible\nteacher: Well, it's already happening!\nteacher: Ok, what do you think food will be like when you are a grown-up? What might change / stay the same?\nstudent: woah\nstudent: that's not an easy question for me to answer\nstudent: of course something will change\nstudent: but I don't know what exactly\nstudent: what*\nteacher: No, that's why we use modal verbs like 'might' and 'may'. To show that we don't know for sure\nteacher: For example, today many more people are vegetarian and vegan than even 20 years ago. Do you think this trend might continue? Do you think people might like lab-grown meat one day?\nstudent: maybe, but being vegan and vegeterian is really good!\nteacher: I agree, and it's a new trend for the western world. That's what I'm talking about, things are changing already!\nteacher: Ok, thanks for today. I hope you enjoy some aspects of the upcoming holiday and raisins don't ruin it all for you! I'll speak to you next Friday :)\nstudent: Thank you ! bye\nteacher: Bye :)",
    "student: Hi Mrs. Miller!\nteacher: Hi Sarah!\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: Good thank you! How about you?\nteacher: Good, thank you! We had a nice long weekend. And my husband got his first jab yesterday!\nstudent: Wow! That's great news!\nstudent: I still don't know when I'll get my first jab...but at least the weather is much better and, if everything goes well, we will go back to Italy at the end of the month :)\nteacher: Yes, I thought it was a historic day but he just moaned about having to queue, haha\nteacher: Yaay, that's excellent news! You must be so looking forward! Your wife got the vaccine, didn't she? Is that because she is a nurse?\nstudent: Indeed I am looking forward to going back :) Not only because I miss my parents and friends, but also because I miss the ability to stay home without the need to watch my children 100% of the time (did I use 'also' correctly here?)\nstudent: Yes, as a nurse she had high priority...but still she got her first jab at the end of March\nteacher: Yes, you used 'also' very well. And I totally get that it's so much easier with children when there are more adults around!\nteacher: If you were writing a C2 essay, I would suggest an inversion here. Not only __ I miss my parents, but also I miss the ability...\nstudent: Not only do I miss my parents, but  I also miss the ability to...\nteacher: Yes, absolutely. But it wouldn't have worked with 'because', you're right\nteacher: You're having some good weather at last then? It's horrid here!\nstudent: Really? Here it is warm and sunny...and, after all the rain of the last weeks, the grass was so green and lush: coming here was a spectacle :)\nteacher: I see, I'm jealous! I was reminded of one of my favourite gardening writers this morning on a school run, he calls this place 'the blustery North Atlantic'\nteacher: But we did need the rain, after a very dry but frosty April!\nteacher: Ok, shall we dive into some C2 practice?\nstudent: Yes, please!\nteacher: To be more precise, what I prepared for today is more of a speculation about it, with the help of some examples\nteacher: The writing you did was Part 2, where you could choose out of several tasks\nteacher: There is only one option in Part 1. You get two paragraphs from two separate texts, on a related topic. The task is to summarise both points of view and express your own in an essay\nstudent: I see..\nteacher: Have you got the pdf that is called 168294-c2-proficiency teacher's handbook from the previous time? If you have it handy, could you go to page 24? If not, I'll email it to you\nstudent: Yes I have it here\nteacher: Lovely! Can you see the part 1 task on page 24?\nstudent: Let me just rotate the page...it is titled Part 1\nstudent: Okay, I am ready\nteacher: That's right! Could you read the two paragraphs, please? The first one is titled 'Shifting sands...'\nteacher: Oh, and read the task as well, please\nstudent: Okay, done\nstudent: Should I try to write the essay 'in real time' here?\nteacher: Lovely. You see what I mean then? Two texts expressing different viewpoints on the same topic\nstudent: Indeed... I have a question, though...when I write, should I talk separately about each essay, or can I avoid expressions such as 'The opinion expressed in ... '\nteacher: Oh, sorry, I missed your question!\nstudent: I just wrote it, don't worry..\nstudent: I was wondering if I have to explicitly recapitulate each essay, or if I should just incorporate their views without making any explicit reference to the paragraphs I have read\nteacher: I actually suggest thinking about how the task is assessed by examiners and looking at some examples first. I'll give you another task to write before the next lesson, or, if you're pushed for time, during the next class\nteacher: It's a very good question, and in fact both approaches are valid! I think it will be helpful for you to see some examples in a minute\nstudent: Okay, I'll read the examples then :)\nteacher: Wait a second!\nteacher: As we said two weeks ago, the writing is assessed by its content (how fully you answer the question, whether the 'target reader' is informed)\nteacher: 2. communicative achievement (how well you communicate complex ideas, whether the style is appropriate - your last essay was very good in this respect!)\nteacher: 3. organisation (we're going to talk a bit more about it in a minute)\nteacher: 4. language (self-explanatory)\nteacher: I think a good way to think about organisation in writing is it's like signposting a road. You are showing the reader where you are about to take them.\nteacher: One of the ways of doing it is clear paragraphing with topic sentences at the beginning of each paragraph. And clear signalling as you move from one idea to another\nteacher: which can involve the use of special phrases to add / contrast ideas, give examples etc.\nteacher: Are you reading the chat or the pdf? :)\nstudent: I am reading the chat\nteacher: Cool, sorry, it's impossible to know!\nstudent: Haha don't worry :)\nteacher: Ok, lovely. Let's go to page 30 in the pdf, please. Without looking at the marks below, what do you think about this piece of writing?\nstudent: Okay, one moment, let me read it\nstudent: The first thing that I think is that evaluating English writing is something I am not that good at :) But then...I find some expressions a bit out of place\nteacher: I know, it's the job of a trained examiner, but I'm just curious about your first impression. You're absolutely right, some expressions are too colloquial!\nstudent: At times I find it hard to follow, for example in the last paragraph\nstudent: So, only by coming to terms with the above-mentioned we, all members of it,'\nteacher: Can you spot any 'linkers'? For example 'In conclusion' is a linker, it introduces the final paragraph\nstudent: I find that writing a bit unclear...\nstudent: Okay, let me look for linkers\nteacher: Yes, I agree with you. Paragraph 3 is not introduced very well (is it adding information to paragraph 2? or arguing with it? - unclear to me!)\nstudent: Nowadays, In this connection (this is an expression I don't really know),  Despite that, At last,\nstudent: Those are the linkers I have found...oh, I have missed a 'Besides' and 'For example,'\nteacher: Absolutely, yes!\nteacher: If you have a look at the marks, you can see that it's an average of 3 (out of 5)\nstudent: Okay, I see my impression about the language was correct\nstudent: I mean, it is the lowest scoring\nteacher: Yes, absolutely. Overall, it's an example of 'good but not great' as you can see\nstudent: I mean, you already confirmed it was correct...but it looks like the biggest problem with the text\nteacher: Ok, could you read the text on the next page, please? Again, without looking at the marks if possible\nstudent: Indeed :) By the way, in Austria and Germany marks at school range from 1 to 5...1 being the highest and 5 the lowest...I find it so confusing!\nstudent: Oh, I immediately see a problem with paragraphs here...\nteacher: Oh goodness, that would really mess with my brain!!\nteacher: Yep, you're absolutely right. This essay would have really benefited from clear paragraphing\nstudent: It feels fragmented...I believe there are too many 'linkers' with too little 'explanation' in between\nteacher: Oh yes, the author navigates between ideas a bit too fast, I think I know what you mean. Again, clear paragraphs with topic sentences would have really helped\nteacher: What about the language?\nstudent: It is better than the previous one, I think...but\nstudent: I don't know...there are some points where I don't know if the grammar is correct or not\nteacher: The language is pretty impressive here, actually. I think the language and ideas really 'carry' this essay\nteacher: Feel free to have a look at the marks now!\nstudent: For example here:  Yet at the heart of the matter is not the issue whether such devices are used or not but ...I would have added an 'of' after whether\nstudent: would that be wrong?\nstudent: Okay, I'll check :)\nstudent: Oh, I see, this is a good one :) Just missing paragraphs!\nteacher: No, you don't need an 'of' there. I don't know whether he agrees or not = I don't know if he agrees or not\nteacher: Yep!\nstudent: I guess I don't like the language because it is above what I could write :)\nstudent: (At least without some exercising)\nteacher: Ok, we're pushed for time now, could you skip the next one and go to the one after? Just for a quick look. Page 33\nstudent: ok\nteacher: Yes, I would say it's not your style, but you use plenty of sophisticated grammar and vocabulary too!\nstudent: I like it\nteacher: So easy to read, isn't it? And it's a 5 out of 5 in terms of marks as you can see!\nstudent: Maybe the language isn't as sophisticated, but it is easy to read and very clear\nstudent: Wow, nice :) I need to write something like this then!\nteacher: Ok, I hope reading the examples and the comments has given you a bit of an idea of how this task might be approached. If you have some time and would like to, there is another Part 1 in the first pdf I sent you\nteacher: You know what, for clarity, I'll email it to you once more!\nstudent: Okay, that sounds great thank you :)\nstudent: Now I have to go, today I have a meeting! Thank you for your time and have a nice week!\nteacher: Sure, have a lovely week, bye!",
    "teacher: Hi Sophia Williams!\nstudent: Hello Ms. Rodriguez!\nstudent: How are you?\nteacher: I'm having a bit of a technical problem today as my laptop decided to go on strike 30 minutes ago. I'm restarting it and hope it'll help!\nteacher: I'm on my phone now, sorry if the responses are much slower!\nteacher: How are you? Looking forward to your holiday?\nstudent: No problem at all\nstudent: My laptop does it all the time...\nteacher: It could be a Windows 10 issue apparently, it kind of just goes into overdrive. Which system are you using?\nstudent: In a way. One part of me is looking forward, the other one is not so excited... Living with the in-laws...\nteacher: Yes, I can see that!\nstudent: I've got a Mac. And its only problem is that it's too old. 7 years\nstudent: Having tried IOS I know I'll never come back to Windows\nteacher: It's still Ms. Rodriguez! I've re-entered from my laptop. Fingers crossed, it seems to be working\nstudent: Yay!\nteacher: Mine is only 12 months old or so, really annoying!\nteacher: But it seems to be behaving now\nstudent: Do what Sophia does when something doesn't work\nstudent: Tell it off saying 'No-no-no' and point your index finger at it\nteacher: Haha, I sometimes feel this is all I can think of!\nteacher: the expression is 'to wag your finger', by the way\nstudent: .. Yes. Sometimes it's all you can do..\nstudent: wag? as in telling off with your finger?\nteacher: like a dog wagging its tail :)\nteacher: Yes!\nteacher: He wagged his finger sternly at the two boys.\nteacher: an example from the dictionary\nstudent: Got it\nstudent: Thanks!\nteacher: We were talking about the word 'posh' last time, weren't we? And I was struggling to explain it as I remember\nstudent: Yes. You explained it just fine, actually\nstudent: actually\nteacher: I found two articles about poshness in my favourite satirical (online) newspaper\nteacher: It's called The Daily Mash, the news is all fake but really funny\nstudent: haha\nteacher: I'm going to send you the first one, it's a good example of ridiculous poshness! One second\nstudent: Ok!\nteacher: English accent so posh man sounds foreign 6th November 2020  A MAN\u2019S accent has become so posh that it no longer sounds as if he is speaking the English language.  Julian Cook, who was born in Surrey, attended boarding school and now works for a London antiques auction house, has progressed beyond well-spoken to a dialect most people no longer recognise as English.  With the help of a translator, Cook said: \u201cMy mother always encouraged us to elongate our vowels as much as possible and not really move our mouths when we speak.  \u201cFor me, being almost incomprehensible is a sign of good breeding.\u201d  While other posh people might occasionally slip in a \u2018Diddy\u2019 for \u2018Daddy\u2019 or say \u2018baarth maart\u2019 instead of \u2018bath mat\u2019, almost every word Cook says bears no resemblance to its written form.     He continued: \u201cIt also doesn\u2019t help that my vocabulary is painfully obscure and I often can\u2019t resist a foray into Latin when I\u2019m doing something like buying a pint of milk at the corner shop.  \u201cI\u2019ve even encountered prejudice because people assume that I can\u2019t possibly be English. Someone told me to go back to where I came from, which is a massive house in Richmond upon Thames.\u201d\nstudent: hahah\nstudent: This is very funny\nteacher: It is, isn't it? :...\nstudent: Is it true, though? Do they speak like that?\nteacher: Well, I don't really hang out with very posh people, so can't really tell :)))\nteacher: Obviously, you can tell if a person is 'well-spoken'.\nstudent: Oh yes. Throwing in some Latin here and there..\nteacher: Yes :)))\nteacher: Ok, the other one!\nteacher: Woman realises her 'posh' friends are just normal people who like olives 10th August 2019  A WOMAN has been under the delusion she was friends with an upper middle-class couple only to discover they just like eating olives.  Emma Bradford, 26, said: \u201cSomeone at work asked me if I knew any really posh people and I said, 'Yes, my good friends Mary and Martin are incredibly sophisticated and well-bred'.  \u201cBut when I told my workmate all about them he said they sounded like perfectly normal people who just enjoyed eating olives from a bowl.  \u201cEven when it wasn't a social function or anything.\u201d  She added: \u201cI did wonder why they read OK! and recorded every episode of Cash in the Attic. But - because of the olives - I assumed it was some sort posh in-joke.     'I don't like them anymore.'\nstudent: hahahah\nstudent: I eat olives. I guess I'm posh too..\nteacher: That's it! :)))\nteacher: As you can see, a person wouldn't describe themselves as posh / a company wouldn't describe their product as posh (without being sarcastic). It's the way other people talk about them :)\nstudent: Do you like olives?\nstudent: Riight\nteacher: So I think Posh Spice is kind of tongue-in-cheek\nstudent: The term 'posh' can only be used to describe someone else\nteacher: I love them! And posh cheeses! :.\nstudent: What's tongue-in-cheek?\nteacher: Oh, if you say something tongue-in-cheek, you mean it as a joke even if you're saying it with a serious face\nstudent: I see\nteacher: The articles in the Daily Mash are very tongue-in-cheek!\nstudent: Is there a good idiom in the Russian language, I wonder\nteacher: I can't even think of a Russian / Ukrainian equivalent to 'posh'. I think it's a British social phenomenon\nteacher: Or, about tongue-in-cheek? Hmm, I'm not sure!\nteacher: But then my Russian is so rusty!\nteacher: Words just don't come to me anymore... *sob*\nstudent: I just tried to google it. I haven't found much\nstudent: That's OK\nstudent: You can quickly restore it\nstudent: If need be (?)\nteacher: I hope so!\nteacher: Yes, if need be!\nstudent: Thanks\nteacher: Ok, let's let you talk a bit more! by answering C2 proficiency speaking questions :)\nstudent: Sure\nteacher: Ok! In part 3 of the speaking test, the interlocutor will give one candidate a card with a topic to talk about, and then ask the second candidate follow-up questions. And then swap\nteacher: So for example, if the other candidate is talking about decisions as there main topic, you have a little bit of time to brainstorm some good vocabulary to do with decisions because the question they are going to ask you is going to be related\nstudent: Ok. So I have to think of all possible phrases with decisions\nteacher: So let's pretend the other candidate is talking about making decisions, and then the examiner turns to you and says, 'Sophia Williams, generally speaking, are you a decisive person?'  (again, remember you don't have to speak the truth and only the truth, just say whatever comes to your mind without searching yourself! I know I tend to go on a journey of self-discovery if faced with a question like this, but the task is really to blurt out whatever comes to your mind in good English!)\nstudent: decision-making process, life-changing events, decision-maker, evaluate, reach an agreement, trade-off, indecisive person\nteacher: Perfect!\nteacher: Go for it :)\nstudent: Frankly speaking, I'm quite the opposite. I see myself as a very indecisive person. It takes me forever to make up my mind. And very often I lean towards the opinion of my significant other or a person I trust.\nteacher: Perfect, beautiful language, love it!\nstudent: Thanks. I didn't even double check it\nstudent: Might have perfected it a little\nstudent: *double check\nteacher: Really well done!\nteacher: Ok, the next question is... Who gives the best advice - friends, family or strangers? Why?\nstudent: I normally assess the value of any advice given to me with my gut. Sometimes a complete stranger might sound very reasonable although I'm not a big fan of people intruding in someone else's life\nteacher: Yes, lovely!\nteacher: One second, just thinking about this expression...\nstudent: Prying -- that's what I wanted to use\nstudent: instead of intruding\nteacher: Yes, prying is very good here!\nstudent: But it slipped my mind and I didn't want to cheat..\nteacher: Yes, fair enough!\nteacher: intruding is fine, by the way! But you're right, 'prying' is very precise\nstudent: Right!\nteacher: Ok! Why do jobs that involve taking difficult decisions appeal to some people?\nstudent: I assume there are many reasons for that. Some people would over-compensate for the lack of involvement in the decision-making process in their formative years. Others may have a role-model, a very decisive mother or a father, who they instinctively want to copy or immitate\nteacher: Love it! 'I assume', 'over-compensate', 'formative years', 'instinctively' - brilliant!\nstudent: Then there are those who feel more worthy and important through participating in some serious decision-'making.\nteacher: And a nice use of modals :)\nstudent: Thanks. I have a good teacher.\nteacher: Noo, I can't take the credit :)\nstudent: #ERROR!\nteacher: Ok, lovely! Hope you'll have a great break, fingers crossed it exceeds expectations :)\nteacher: Same time on Thursday, right?\nstudent: Still, I doubt I can say all that effortlessly\nstudent: Thank you! Have a great weekend!)\nstudent: See you on Thursday!\nteacher: Thank you! Bye! :)\nstudent: Bye!",
    "student: Hi Ms. Rodriguez!\nteacher: Hi Sarah!\nteacher: How are you today?\nstudent: Fine, thank you\nstudent: How are you?\nteacher: I'm good too, thank you!\nteacher: Are you looking forward to another long weekend?\nstudent: Yes, we have one more bank holiday next Monday\nteacher: Yes, sure. Just 'next Monday'\nteacher: Generally, when we use words and expressions that contain 'day', the preposition is 'on'\nteacher: on Monday, on Monday morning, on my birthday, on Christmas Day\nstudent: it was on\nstudent: it was on\nstudent: Just a typo\nstudent: )\nteacher: but: in the morning, at Christmas\nteacher: Haha, I see! If you're using 'next' you don't need a preposition at all :)\nstudent: aha\nstudent: I had that idea\nteacher: or 'last' (last Monday, last night)\nteacher: Anyway, are you planning anything nice for the weekend?\nstudent: but remembering the rule I decided to use on\nstudent: but not successfully ))))\nteacher: I see! :)) Yes, it's a bit confusing...\nstudent: Maybe we will go to the countryside with my family\nstudent: We have a nice place near Kyiv\nstudent: it is called Dva bobra .\nstudent: two something in English .\nstudent: I don't know how to say bober )\nteacher: two beavers :)\nstudent: Ah! Yes!\nteacher: Sounds very nice!\nstudent: They have a nice territory with a pond and two small beaches\nstudent: Also there is a restaurant there\nteacher: What's the weather going to be like?\nstudent: and also we can pay for a special place like besedka in Russian with mangal in Russian .\nstudent: And we can use this stuff all day and bring our food and drinks .\nteacher: Ok, besedka is a gazebo\nteacher: /\u0261\u0259\u02c8zi\u02d0.b\u0259\u028a/\nstudent: Oh! I've never heard it .\nteacher: and mangal is a barbecue!\nteacher: easy-peasy\nstudent: Ah! Of course! ..\nteacher: Yes, 'gazebo' sounds a bit funny; apparently, it comes from Italian\nteacher: Well, your plan sounds lovely! Hope the weather will be good!\nstudent: It doesn't look like an English word really .\nteacher: But if not, the barbecue will keep you warm and the gazebo will keep the rain off :)\nstudent: We hope so too )\nteacher: What are you going to barbecue?\nstudent: It should be +18 and sunny\nteacher: Ooh, brilliant!\nstudent: According to the forecast )\nteacher: Yes, according to the forecast. Fingers crossed!\nstudent: I should find Sophia's sunscreen\nstudent: from the last summer\nstudent: r\nstudent: sorry )\nteacher: no worries\nstudent: According to! Of course one more time ..\nteacher: We're dithering about whether we need a barbecue for the garden\nteacher: No worries, I know that you know :)\nstudent: haha .\nstudent: Why are you dithering?\nstudent: Is it not good for your plants?\nteacher: On the one hand, it would be nice to barbecue every now and then. On the other hand, that might mean we will eat more meat (and we're trying to eat less). Also, I'm a bit nervous about Ethan running around and a hot barbecue. Even though he's usually quite careful!\nstudent: I see\nteacher: We have a sitting area in the garden where we eat in the summer, but yes, I'd have to move my plant pots to make room for the barbecue\nstudent: I worry about dangerous stuff quite often too\nteacher: But now that you've mentioned it, I'm craving a barbecue :)\nstudent: Are you really trying to eat less meat?\nteacher: Do you know 'crave'?\nteacher: Yes! for the planet :)\nstudent: no\nteacher: We still eat some meat, but we have a lot of meat-free days too\nstudent: I don't know the word\nteacher: If a person craves something, they want it very much. e.g. He's the fifth child in the family, no one has time for him and he just craves attention!\nstudent: I'm asking you because you know Aiden doesn't eat red meat and actually I don't like it too much either\nteacher: But often, we use 'crave' to talk about the food we really want! Craving a cold beer on a hot summer day, craving a barbecue, craving some chocolate\nstudent: But if I don't eat it I have some problems with ferritin\nstudent: sorry\nstudent: ferritin\nteacher: Ok, your iron levels?\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: We're not nearly as good as my sister, who as you probably know is vegan\nstudent: And I think I should control that Sophia eats meat too\nteacher: She knows all these plant-based recipes and even makes her own yogurt with some oat milk\nstudent: So now I think we should eat meat but I still don't like it very much .\nteacher: Does she like meat? We couldn't be vegetarian at the moment because Ethan loves chicken and sausages :.\nstudent: She likes it but she doesn't love it I think .\nteacher: But we try to buy better meat, like free-range or even organic (even though it's very expensive here)\nstudent: She likes \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043b\u0435\u0442\u043a\u0438 .\nstudent: and \u043f\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438 .\nstudent: How can I translate \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0441\u043f\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0439\u043d\u043e \u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043a \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430\u043c? .\nteacher: Haha, well, I don't blame her. Pelmeni has always been my absolute favourite food!\nteacher: She is indifferent to sausages?\nstudent: I should mention it because it is very surprising for us ) Usually kids love sausages )\nteacher: Yes! True! Sausages and pasta\nstudent: and she loves shrimps ))\nstudent: Surprise! .\nteacher: Ooh, she's got a taste for grown-up foods!\nstudent: I even have to limit the number of shrimps in her pasta\nstudent: sorry\nstudent: limit the number of shrimps in her pasta .\nteacher: Interesting!\nstudent: Usually I cook \u0431\u0443\u043b\u0433\u0443\u0440? or pasta with shrimps and broccoli or zucchini .\nteacher: Actually, I've prepared something about food for today :)\nstudent: I'm ready for food ))\nteacher: bulgar wheat\nteacher: /\u02c8b\u028cl.\u0261\u0259r/\nteacher: Not just food, the foods of the future!\nstudent: ok!\nteacher: You know how the production of a lot of foods that we eat is not very sustainable at the moment. Sustainable = able to continue for a long time\nstudent: Aha! I know the word\nteacher: They are talking a lot about sustainable food and sustainable energy at the moment because we're running out of the old resources\nteacher: Oh good!\nstudent: it is  used for clothes too now\nteacher: Yes, absolutely. Sustainable fashion\nstudent: Aha!\nteacher: Ok, have you probably heard about some new foods that will be available in the future? What might / could we eat? 10 or 20 or 30 years from now. What do you think?\nstudent: beyond meat? )\nstudent: Aiden likes it ..\nteacher: Beyond meat? I've not heard about it! Is it a product?\nstudent: Yes\nstudent: You can google it\nstudent: it is not real meat\nstudent: but it tastes like real .\nteacher: Interesting! It's available in Ukraine then? I've never seen it here\nteacher: Thank you, I see!\nstudent: Yes! Usually we don't buy it for cooking at home but we buy burgers with it for example at restaurants\nteacher: I see! Sounds very cool!\nstudent: You should try it!\nteacher: I've never seen any 'beyond meat' products, but there are several companies that sell meat-free burgers, sausages, steaks etc. here\nstudent: maybe it is an American name\nstudent: I'm not sure\nstudent: here we use this name for this kind of meat\nteacher: Yes, it says on the website that it's an LA company\nstudent: Ah! I see now\nteacher: Well, the UK's relationship with the EU seems to be getting worse and worse, I'm sure we'll be importing from the US very soon instead!\nteacher: Ok, so you're saying that people might be finding alternatives to meat, right? Anything else?\nstudent: maybe you are right!\nstudent: hm\nstudent: maybe eat more plant-based food\nstudent: \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0438\u0449\u0430?\nteacher: plant-based food\nstudent: plant-based food\nstudent: food\nteacher: Yes, plant, without the 'i'\nstudent: don't use animals for producing food\nstudent: I'm not sure about the topic )\nteacher: Yes, it's more sustainable to eat plants then to feed plants to animals and then eat the animals!\nteacher: At least that's the idea I think\nteacher: Ok, sure!\nteacher: Just a couple of words before I send you a text to read about it\nstudent: Ok!\nteacher: alga /\u02c8\u00e6l\u00b7\u0261\u0259/\nteacher: the plural form is 'algae'\nteacher: /\u02c8\u00e6l\u00b7d\u0292i/\nteacher: it's a simple plant that grows near water or underwater\nteacher: for example seaweed\nstudent: \u0432\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0438?\nteacher: as you can probably guess, it's one of the food alternatives :)\nteacher: Yes, that's right!\nstudent: I know about clothes from algae .\nteacher: Do you like seaweed? to eat\nteacher: Oh yes, sure!\nstudent: I like it but I eat it very rarely\nstudent: rarely?\nteacher: rarely, yes\nteacher: Well, it's nori in sushi, isn't it\nteacher: I love Ukrainian pickled seaweed :) I buy it from the local Lithuanian shop here\nstudent: But I don't eat sushi very often ..\nteacher: Oh yes, I remember you said!\nstudent: I should buy it too. It's a good idea .\nteacher: I don't eat sushi very often'\nstudent: I see )\nteacher: would be a more natural way to say it\nteacher: Ok! the next word is 'livestock'. livestock = all the animals that we eat on a farm\nstudent: aha\nteacher: It's uncountable.\nteacher: a livestock farmer raises cows, chickens, sheep etc.\nstudent: It's clear thank you\nteacher: Ok, great, and you probably remember the last one. If something is suitable for eating, it's e.....\nstudent: edible\nteacher: Yay, well done!\nteacher: And the opposite is...?\nstudent: inedible\nteacher: Correct!\nteacher: Yes, like in 'foraging for edible mushrooms'\nstudent: aha\nteacher: Ok, lovely! I'll send you the link to the text to read before our next class if you have the time, ok?\nstudent: Lovely, thank you!\nstudent: See you next Wednesday .\nteacher: Sure! And our next class is on Wednesday at 11.30, right?\nstudent: Thank you for the lesson\nteacher: Yes, correct, on Wednesday :)\nstudent: ah\nstudent: just next Wednesday?\nteacher: It's my pleasure :) Have a lovely weekend! Don't eat anything inedible!\nstudent: You too! Thank you )))\nstudent: bye xx\nteacher: Bye! :)",
    "student: Hi!\nstudent: How are you?\nteacher: Hi Sophia Jones!\nteacher: I'm good, thank you! I've spent the whole morning gardening, so I'm very happy :)\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: I am good\nstudent: feel nice\nstudent: we are at school again\nteacher: Do you mean you're at school now?\nstudent: no\nstudent: we just went back to school on Tuesday\nteacher: Hmm, do you mean today was your first day back at school?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Aah, I see! Were you studying online then?\nstudent: oh no\nstudent: Tuesday was my first day back at school\nteacher: I see! In this case, 'we ___ ____ back at school ____ Tuesday'\nstudent: have been, since\nteacher: No! :) If you're using 'on Tuesday' you need past simple. We went back to school on Tuesday\nteacher: But if you're using present perfect (which is a good idea), you need a different word before Tuesday\nteacher: it started on Tuesday and it's still happening!\nstudent: you wrote two ___ and I wrote present perfect\nteacher: Yes, we have been back at school ____ Tuesday\nteacher: s....\nstudent: since\nteacher: Yay! We got there eventually\nteacher: You have been back at school since Tuesday then\nteacher: And now there's another long weekend coming, right? Have you got any nice plans?\nstudent: nah, tomorrow it is my mom's friend's birthday and we are going\nteacher: I see!\nteacher: This takes us nicely to today's topic, actually. Talking about the future. Would you say it's a plan, to go to your mom's friend's birthday?\nstudent: my parent's plan, not mine, for me it is a fact\nteacher: Ok, fair enough. To talk about plans, even very solid plans that are like a fact, we use... do you remember this?\nteacher: we ___ ____ to my mom's friend's b-day party (go)\nstudent: will go-me, are going to go-my parents.\nteacher: Hmm, you know what, I'm going to send you a description of how 'will' and present continuous / going to work for the future, and you have a think if it fits\nstudent: okay\nteacher: 1. We use the present simple for something scheduled:  We have a lesson next Monday. The train arrives at 6.30 in the morning. The holidays start next week. It's my birthday tomorrow.  2. We can use the present continuous for plans or arrangements:  I'm playing football tomorrow. They are coming to see us tomorrow. We're having a party at Christmas.  3. We use will:  when we express beliefs about the future: It will be a nice day tomorrow. I think Brazil will win the World Cup. I'm sure you will enjoy the film.  to mean want to or be willing to: I hope you will come to my party. George says he will help us.  to make offers and promises : I'll see you tomorrow. We'll send you an email.  to talk about offers and promises: Tim will be at the meeting. Mary will help with the cooking.  4. We use be going to:  to talk about plans or intentions: I'm going to drive to work today. They are going to move to Manchester.  to make predictions based on evidence we can see: Be careful! You are going to fall. .= I can see that you might fall.. Look at those black clouds. I think it's going to rain. .= I can see that it will rain..\nstudent: we are going to a b-day party\nstudent: that fits\nteacher: Yes, exactly!\nteacher: Will expresses other things: what you believe / hope / are sure / not sure will happen in the future\nteacher: or what you offer / promise\nteacher: like 'I will love you forever!' 'I will buy you a new iPhone'\nteacher: things like that :)\nteacher: What if you're not sure about what will happen? There's a very compact way to express it.\nteacher: It ____ be sunny at the weekend (maybe yes, maybe no, I don't know)\nstudent: will\nteacher: Hmm, how can we better expressed that we're not sure?\nteacher: remember may / might / could?\nstudent: going to\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Yeah, the modals will be great here\nteacher: Ok, let's practise this a little. Put the verb in brackets into the correct tense, please\nteacher: Los Angeles is a great city. I'm sure you    (have) a good time there.\nstudent: will\nteacher: Yes, good!\nteacher: I'm not sure but we     (see) Catrina at the funeral tomorrow.\nstudent: are going to see\nteacher: how to express that we're not sure about it?\nteacher: *are going to see sounds like you're very sure! For example, tomorrow you're going to see your mum's friend .we can be pretty sure about it!.\nstudent: will?\nteacher: might / may / could!\nteacher: Does it make sense to you?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Ok, the next one then!\nteacher: I've already decided. I    (phone) my bank manager tomorrow.\nstudent: you said for modals we use going to\nteacher: No no no! There's a misunderstanding. We usually use the modals separately from going to\nteacher: we might see Catrina... all you need is a modal verb and an infinitive\nstudent: am phoning\nteacher: It might rain tomorrow. He could know the answer. = we're not sure\nteacher: Are you on the phone you mean?\nstudent: plan\nteacher: Oh sorry, you doing the next task!\nteacher: Yes, good! Because it's a plan the person's made\nstudent: yes\nstudent: heh\nteacher: The next course     (start) on 1 July. That's what the website says.\nstudent: starts\nteacher: Yes, good!\nteacher: I     (help) you do the washing up if you like.\nstudent: will\nteacher: Yes!\nteacher: Bella and I     (get) married in the summer. We've already agreed on the date.\nstudent: are getting\nteacher: Yes, good!\nteacher: Ok, lovely! Do you remember we talked about food of the future last time? Can you make a few sentences about what we might eat in the future, using the future forms we've just talked about?\nstudent: Some insects taste like products we usually eat, so more people will eat insects soon\nteacher: Yes, that might happen! :)\nstudent: Some labs will try to make lab-grown meat\nteacher: Yes, it's happening already I think\nteacher: Oh, have you watched more of the Queen's Gambit, by the way?\nstudent: we finished watching it\nstudent: I love it\nteacher: Ok, cool! Did you like it?\nteacher: Ah yes, so good, isn't it?\nstudent: Yes!\nteacher: What do you think might happen to Beth in the future??\nstudent: maybe she will come back to America and will visit Russia next year again to participate in the world championship\nstudent: world*\nteacher: Yes, good idea! How can we express 'maybe ... will' in one (modal) verb?\nstudent: might\nteacher: Ok, so 'she might come back to America'\nteacher: Ok, what else?\nstudent: she might move to Paris or she might visit her friends who helped her on her way\nteacher: Yes, that might happen!\nteacher: Do you think Townes and she will live happily ever after?\nstudent: Townes?\nstudent: I don't actually remember\nteacher: Hmm, what was his name? The handsome guy\nstudent: ohh\nstudent: that journalist, right?\nteacher: a chess player who became a journalist I think\nteacher: yes, the journalist\nstudent: yess\nstudent: I think so, but I didn't really like him\nteacher: No? Why not?\nstudent: not my type\nteacher: Did you think there was someone else who would have been better for her?\nstudent: no\nstudent: all her boyfriends are strange\nteacher: Haha, well, she isn't very ordinary herself :)\nteacher: Ok, Sophia Jones, have a lovely weekend, I'll talk to you next Friday! :)\nstudent: and I think her girlfriend's type of life wouldn't be okay for her\nstudent: okay, bye bye\nteacher: Ok! We can talk about it some more next time",
    "student: Hi Ms. Rodriguez! How are you?\nstudent: This week was a bit more intense than I expected so I couldn't do the writing, but I should have the time to do it tomorrow, I'll send it to you :)\nteacher: Hi Sophia! All good, thank you! How are you?\nteacher: Yes, sure, no worries!\nstudent: I am good, thank you! Just a bit tired: this week both my children had nightmares...\nstudent: ..and next week we're going back to Italy, I am so looking forward to that :)\nteacher: Oh, do they wake up at night with nightmares?\nteacher: Yaay, I'm so happy for you!\nstudent: Yes, they both ended up sleeping with me and my wife...the bed was a bit overcrowded...\nteacher: We're being unlocked again on Monday, almost completely this time (but not quite, the final unlocking is June 21). We'll also be allowed to travel and stop with relatives (which we're going to do during the school holidays at the end of May)\nteacher: I see, yes, you must be so tired!\nstudent: Well, there have been worse nights, but it is starting to get better with their sleep, so I am not used to this anymore...\nstudent: Yes, I have read a lot of good news about the UK...in Italy it isn't that good, but we are visiting family so we can do it...\nteacher: Haha, I get that, it's the power of expectation, isn't it (in terms of sleep)\nstudent: I guess so :)\nteacher: Oh I see, only family members are allowed to meet? I'm not relishing this newly-found freedom, actually, not until I've had the reassurance of a vaccine\nstudent: No, but some limitations remain...but, since we are visiting family it isn't a problem...and luckily my older relatives are all vaccinated so it shouldn't be a problem...\nstudent: I mean, we should be on the safe side, I will be the one most at risk\nteacher: Lovely! I hope you have a great time! Shall we reschedule the next class in this case?\nteacher: I see, yes, you're the only one who hasn't had a jab yet...\nstudent: Well, Tuesday would be okay, but Thursday or Friday would indeed be better (we will travel back to Austria next Tuesday)\nteacher: Let me have a quick look\nteacher: I can do the same time on Thursday. How about that?\nstudent: That's perfect, I'll note it down. Thank you!\nteacher: Lovely, I've written it down too now\nteacher: Ok, shall we have a look at the remaining use of English tasks? I think we have two left if I remember correctly, the word formation one and the key word transformation\nstudent: Okay!\nteacher: page 13 in the pdf ('teacher's handbook')\nteacher: Part 3 The migration of birds\nstudent: Okay, found it!\nteacher: Lovely\nstudent: 17. scarcity 18. genetically 19. courrance 20. sensitivity 21. spectacularly\nstudent: 22. advantageous 23. progressively 24. evolutionary\nstudent: I will admit that I am not 100% about all spellings...\nteacher: Your spelling is on the money except for 19, which I think is a typo...\nstudent: oh, I forgot the initial 'o', right?\nteacher: Hmm, how would you spell the whole word?\nstudent: occurrence\nteacher: occurrence\nteacher: it's a tricky one!\nstudent: Haha, I just opened the Cambridge...yep, indeed occurrence\nteacher: No worries, everything else is perfect :)\nstudent: Great!\nteacher: Part 4? You probably remember the key word transformation task. Change the sentence using the word given, keeping the meaning as close to the original as possible (re-using words if necessary)\nteacher: Use between 3 and 8 words for each gap\nstudent: Yes I remember it! The tricky part was to alter the sentence as little as possible...\nteacher: Yes, to preserve the meaning\nstudent: 25. were instructed to make their way (I am not sure 'make way' could be used like this...this is a guess)\nteacher: nearly! 'were instructed to make their way'\nteacher: Yes, it can! 'Please, make your way down the bus' etc.\nstudent: 26. not to take sides of the argument .could I use 'not to take sides in...?'.\nteacher: no to take sides IN the argument :.\nstudent: so the correct answer was: 26. not to take sides in the argument?\nteacher: Ooh, sorry, 'not' of course\nstudent: Okay, this time trying not to change words caused a mistake...\nteacher: Yes, not to take sides in the argument\nteacher: Oh, I see. Yes, you're removing the whole of the phrasal verb 'stay out of'\nstudent: 28. isn't open to (27 is hard, I'll think about it again in a few mins)\nstudent: 29. matter how late\nteacher: Could you check the tense in 28, please? The tense should remain the same!\nstudent: oh...\nstudent: 28. wasn't open to\nteacher: 28. wasn't open to further\nstudent: okay, indeed...I can't remove words...\nstudent: Haha, this time it's trickier than I expected :P\nstudent: 30. caught the view of Emma\nteacher: Ok, thanks, let's take them one by one!\nteacher: Oh, you wanted to go back to 27?\nstudent: 27. success is under threat for the lack of\nstudent: I remember this exercise being easier...please, let's review\nstudent: them, I can feel that things aren't 'exactly correct'...\nteacher: Nearly! success is under threat due to / because of /owing to the lack of\nstudent: but aren't those 9 words?\nteacher: Oh, I mean 'due to / because of / owing to' are options, you'd only use one\nteacher: Oh wait, I know what you mean, one sec\nstudent: success is under threat due to the lack of\nstudent: those are 9 words..I had initially written the sentence with 'because of' and resorted to the 'for' because of the 8 words limit\nstudent: But then, I agree that those options are better :)\nteacher: Wow, this is a mistake in the key I believe! This is the stuff people like my husband get fired for :)\nstudent: Really? Fired?\nteacher: It never occurred to me to count the words\nteacher: Well, that's a bit of an exaggeration, but they\nteacher: *they'd be in a bit of a trouble\nstudent: Sorry, that's a habit of my trade\nteacher: due to the lack of accuracy in the answer key :)\nstudent: I see :) In Italy the final exam for high school is written in Rome...and it happened to contain very bad mistakes...but I am sure nobody got into real trouble...\nteacher: 28. was not open to further\nteacher: You'd still get one point out of two without 'further'\nstudent: I see...that's something I overlooked really\nteacher: Oh there was a big scandal to do with final exams a couple of years ago here, but it was not in my husband's department.\nstudent: (with habit of my trade I mean, because I studied mathematics...I was wondering if the expression 'habit of my trade' is appropriate here, or I have just made it up)...\nteacher: No, I got what you meant! it's a fine expression :)\nteacher: Ok, 29. No matter how late ___ ___ when you get home,..\nstudent: it is\nteacher: Yes!\nteacher: and 30. caught a glimpse / caught sight of Emma\nteacher: You would still get one point for 'of Emma', by the way\nstudent: Assuming the verb to be or to have as understood is a typical mistake for Italians, I believe...we often do it...\nteacher: Oh really? Interesting!\nstudent: I see...okay, both those options were on the tip of my tongue...\nteacher: I remember when I did Latin at university it surprised me that the subject was often dropped (it was expressed by the form of the verb). Has Italian retained it?\nstudent: but I assumed 'view' would work too...\nstudent: but okay...to catch a glimpse of someone...I have read it so many times...\nteacher: No, unfortunately. But as you can see, the moral of the story is, even if you're not sure about the right expression, right something because you might still get one point\nteacher: Yes, I'm sure\nstudent: next time I'll remember :)\nteacher: So some useful expressions from this exercise are\nteacher: 1. make your way (somewhere) 2. take sides in an argument 3. be under threat because of\nteacher: 4. open to further discussion 5. catch a glimpse of / catch sight of\nstudent: Yep...\nstudent: Making your way could be used also in a figurative way, right? As in, 'I'm making my way through the material for the exam.'\nteacher: Yes, I think so! Make my way through = good, as in I was making my way through the crowd to where my friends stood\nteacher: Ok, let's try a couple of speaking questions in the remaining 10 minutes\nstudent: Oh, I see...I inadvertently added the word 'through'\nstudent: So it technically is another verb...anyhow, thanks!\nteacher: They start from easier personal ones in part 1 and go to more abstract ones in the following parts\nteacher: I'm a bit confused, what's another verb?\nstudent: I mean that your example was 'Make your way (somewhere)'\nstudent: while my example used 'make your way through (something)'\nteacher: Most candidates take their speaking exam in pairs, with another candidate who they don't have to know\nteacher: Oh, I see, you probably mean another word, not verb, right?\nstudent: Hmm...I meant 'another phrasal verb', because the meaning of the two expressions is different...but maybe I am the one who is just complicating things\nteacher: But sometimes, you might do a speaking test in a group of three if there is an odd number of candidates .but there are provisions for this, you will still get the same exam and the same assessment!.\nteacher: Oh, I'm with you now! I'd say it's the same expression, just a different preposition of place\nstudent: Okay, thank you! So...about the speaking exam...I remember being randomly paired with a classmate for the FCE...I guess the setting is similar here, right?\nteacher: Yes, exactly. I just wanted to mention that if you find yourself in a group of three, you're not disadvantaged in any way (some people start to panic a bit)\nstudent: Oh, okay...\nteacher: And it doesn't matter how well the other candidate performs! Examiners are trained to assess individually, never compare. .probably obvious to you, but I thought I'd still mention it.\nteacher: Part 1 starts with very basic questions such as where you are from and whether you work or you're a student\nstudent: I see :) I guess it will take a bit longer, though, if there are three candidates...\nteacher: Just to break the ice, you won't have much chance to shine with the first couple of questions\nteacher: Yes, it takes a bit longer, so that everyone has an equal opportunity to speak\nteacher: And we're out of time! We can always do this next Thursday. If you have time to do the writing on holiday - great, but if not, don't feel under pressure, please! I hope you have a great well-deserved break!\nstudent: Thank you :) Yes, it shouldn't be a problem...it really was a bit hectic with the vacation coming and the kids, but I'll probably get bored if I don't study :)\nteacher: Haha, ok! Speak to you on Thursday then!\nstudent: Then next Thursday I'll discover what happens after the initial presentation...thank you for the lesson, and have a nice week!\nteacher: Thanks, you too! Have a great time!\nteacher: Bye!\nstudent: Thanks, bye!",
    "student: Hi Mr. Johnson!\nteacher: Hi Samantha Smith!\nteacher: How are you today?\nstudent: Fine\nstudent: Fine, thank you\nteacher: Did you have a good long weekend?

It's a big step, isn't it? Will you still have the nanny for a bit?\nstudent: So I had a chance to visit the lab .\nstudent: Yes! We've decided to start now because it seems like a good season regarding some 'kids' diseases'\nteacher: I see what you mean, it should be easier in the summer, yes\nstudent: Yes, definitely we will still have the nanny!\nstudent: We will start with two hours I think\nstudent: So we need the nanny )\nteacher: Sure, sounds like a gentle start for Liam!\nstudent: But actually our nanny is on annual leave every June so we will be without her next month\nteacher: How are you feeling about it? Are you nervous / excited?\nteacher: Oh I see! When can Liam start at the kindergarten?\nstudent: I feel just ok ) A bit nervous but just about some \u043e\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0442\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044b .\nstudent: Oh\nstudent: sorry\nstudent: .\nteacher: No worries. Is the chatroom working ok for you?\nteacher: I've noticed it's been taking you a bit longer than usual to type, is it the program?\nstudent: On Friday we have a tour of her class . and then we will start from next Monday .\nteacher: Ooh, I see! Best of luck to you all! Hope she enjoys it!\nstudent: I think it was more about the Internet connection on my side\nteacher: It must have been, because it's working fine for me\nteacher: What time is your first visit on Friday? Do we need to re-schedule our lesson?\nstudent: We have to be there at 11 am so I think it works with our class\nstudent: Mr. Johnson : Ooh, I see! Best of luck to you all! Hope she enjoys it! - thank you! xx\nteacher: Ok, sure!\nstudent: And what about \u043e\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0437\u0432\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044b? . How can I explain it in English? )\nteacher: Ok, lovely, shall we go to our foods of the future? and the new words, especially the fetal bovine serum :))))\nstudent: hahaha\nteacher: That's a good question! I would say 'the admin'\nstudent: Yes, let's do it .\nteacher: Wait, what do you mean? Do you mean the paper work, tests etc.? or do you mean the logistics of taking Liam to the nursery / picking her up, for example?\nstudent: I mean the paperwork and tests .\nteacher: I would say, the paper work, filling in forms etc. is the admin\nteacher: which is a short for 'administration'\nteacher: We also usually do some admin at work. Keeping the papers up to date etc.\nstudent: And if we add the preparation of some stuff like extra clothes etc?\nteacher: Sometimes, if you're booking something, for example an Airbnb, you have to pay an admin fee (for the booking, the work of the website etc)\nteacher: That's the preparation like you said, or the 'prep' :)\nstudent: I see, thank you!\nteacher: And who is dropping Liam off / picking her up is the logistics :)\nstudent: Aha )\nteacher: It's like running a small business! The prep, the admin and the logistics :)\nstudent: yeah! ))))\nteacher: :))))\nstudent: and also you have to do some communication stuff like in business )))\nteacher: I personally think it's a good age to start at a nursery. She's nearly 4 and can understand things so much better, and also talk about them\nstudent: to manage good communication I mean .\nteacher: Yes, definitely!\nstudent: Yes, I feel more comfortable about it now than several years ago\nteacher: Yes, every year makes a difference at this age, doesn't it?\nstudent: even half a year )\nteacher: Yes, I completely agree\nteacher: Ok, the foods of the future! I know you read the article yesterday. What do you remember best from it?\nstudent: Insects!!! ..\nteacher: Haha, yum!\nteacher: Ok, could you give me a couple of nice sentences with some modals. What we might / could / may eat in the future. Or what you definitely won't eat! :)\nstudent: I'm not a person from the future )\nteacher: Of course not! But the modals actually help us show that we're not sure about what might happen. It might or it might not!\nstudent: We might eat algae )\nteacher: Yes indeed!\nstudent: I think it's the most popular thing for making some sustainable stuff now\nstudent: Food, clothes, packaging etc.\nteacher: Yes, because algae grow so fast I suppose\nteacher: algae and bamboo :)\nstudent: )\nstudent: also we may eat insects (not me)\nteacher: Haha, I'm the same! Never. I can't even make myself try snails\nteacher: or escargot I should say\nstudent: I like oysters but it's different I think .\nstudent: they taste more like \u0441\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043a\u0430 ..\nteacher: I like oysters too! They taste like sea water to me, but in a nice way\nteacher: But yes, they are also mollusks like snails I suppose\nteacher: But snails and slugs are my garden archenemy\nstudent: Agree! But you know that lots of people can't eat oysters because of their consistency I think\nteacher: Hmm, did you mean 'lots of people'?\nstudent: actually we were discussing the difference between snails and slugs with Liam yesterday ))))\nteacher: Ok! What did you say to her?\nstudent: Yes, sorry, it's autocorrection! Lots of people! )\nstudent: I think snails have their shells and slugs don't have any.....\nteacher: No worries, I got it!\nstudent: it was my explanation\nstudent: )\nteacher: Slugs are like snails but not as cute :) Yes, that's how explain it too!\nstudent: haha\nteacher: Slugs come out at night and eat my courgette seedlings! Horrible creatures\nstudent: You know we like the cartoon about Ben and Holly\nteacher: Oh yes, with the barking ladybird\nstudent: There is an episode about slugs ) they are very cute there )\nteacher: Noooo, impossible!\nstudent: Mr. Johnson : Oh yes, with the barking ladybird  - and with Boris .\nteacher: :)))\nstudent: I'll send you the link.\nteacher: Boris? Is Boris the name of the ladybird?\nteacher: I refuse to watch cartoons about slugs!\nteacher: Ok, does the article mention any foods you are excited about?\nstudent: no, no! Their mayor of the city looks like Boris Johnson .\nteacher: Oh God, really? I'll check it out later on\nstudent: I think the idea of eating seaweed sounds ok to me\nteacher: Yes, I agree!\nstudent: also I like the idea with fake fish and seafood, also with meat\nstudent: so it looks like I would prefer to eat the usual food in the future, but if this food is grown using some safe methods\nstudent: *but if\nteacher: Yes, that would be nice! Some 'ethical' lab-grown meat and fish\nstudent: Agree!\nteacher: How do you like the idea of chewable coffee?\nstudent: I like the idea of 3D printed food but I think it will take lots of time before people really will be able to produce this type of food\nstudent: I'm not sure that I would like to chew coffee instead of drinking it ..\nteacher: Oh yes, it says the design is still in concept stage\nstudent: But I will definitely try it if I can )\nteacher: The verb is 'chew'. I agree with you, I'd rather have a cup of coffee!\nstudent: 100% .\nteacher: I think people in Ukraine are doing much better than here in the UK in terms of eating seasonal and local food\nstudent: I agree\nteacher: It is possible to buy courgettes, tomatoes and strawberries in the winter in Ukraine, but I think most people are used to eating them when they are actually in season\nstudent: I think it's more of a cultural thing here, not deliberate )\nstudent: deliberate sorry )\nteacher: In the UK, you can buy almost anything out of season because it's imported from Spain, for example. But it's not good for the environment and the food is not as great as when it's in season\nteacher: Yes, definitely!\nstudent: But I remember how exciting  it was to eat a watermelon in London in May )\nteacher: Yes! We had a watermelon yesterday, actually, and I also marvelled at it. To me, watermelons are for August!\nstudent: But I agree with you, it is better to eat seasonal vegetables and fruit. They are tasty and healthy\nteacher: Definitely. And then a long winter of cabbage, potatoes and pumpkins :)\nstudent: ..\nstudent: onions and beetroot )\nteacher: Ok, I'll let you go now! We will revise the words from the article on Friday, and good luck to you and Liam!\nstudent: and carrots\nstudent: carrots )\nstudent: Thank you!\nstudent: See you on Friday\nteacher: Oh yes, at least we have some carrots :)\nteacher: Speak to you on Friday, take care!\nstudent: Have a good afternoon xx\nteacher: You too, thank you",
    "teacher: Hi Liam!\nstudent: Hello Ms. Rivera!\nteacher: How are you today?\nstudent: I'm fine. And you?\nstudent: I'm on time today - yay!..\nteacher: Haha, yay..\nteacher: I'm fine too, thank you!\nteacher: How was your trip?\nstudent: It actually exceeded my expectations\nstudent: It was nice\nstudent: nice\nstudent: The in-laws behaved well ))))\nteacher: Super! Low expectations are sometimes the key to success :))\nteacher: Haha, always a plus!\nstudent: They are, aren't they?\nteacher: Yes, I've learned it the hard way with holidays :) Especially with weather in this country. If I obssess about the weather and check the forecast every minute before the holiday, it's likely to be ruined. But if I just assume it's going to rain all week, I get pleasantly surprised :))))\nteacher: Sorry, I misspelled 'obsess', didn't I?\nstudent: I think this kind of philosophy applies to all spheres of life.\nstudent: I haven't even noticed..\nteacher: Yes, assess, but obsess. And the killer is of course 'embarrass'\nstudent: haha\nteacher: I can't be so chilled in all areas of life though! I barely manage it with holidays! ..\nstudent: possess also\nteacher: Ooh, yes, good one!\nteacher: So 'obsess' is the odd one out, actually, with just the three 'sss\nstudent: Right. The weakest link..\nteacher: Loser!\nteacher: Oh, I've been enjoying ALMA videos so much! Well done ladies!\nstudent: Really?\nstudent: Thank you!\nstudent: The editing took me forever\nstudent: I really laughed at your comment to Sarah Chen\nteacher: Did you do all the editing? Amazing!\nteacher: Goodness, it's because I actually say it now! You know, 'I'll be there' but in Russian, and then I always think that :)))\nstudent: Yes. I'm usually the camerawoman and the editor .\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0436\u0435\u0440?.\nteacher: Yes, it's video editing, isn't it? It's even a category at Oscars, Baftas and whatnots\nstudent: Oh yes, it grows on you. The language environment I mean\nteacher: Wow, I didn't know! You're multi-talented!\nstudent: Right!\nstudent: I'm the jack of all trades\nstudent: and master of none..\nteacher: Haha, I'm sure that's not true :)\nteacher: What do you shoot the videos with?\nstudent: Actually, it is true. And I'm OK with it.\nstudent: My iphone =.\nteacher: Well, why not indeed!\nteacher: Oh really? Wow! Well done you and well done your iphone! I thought it was shot professionally\nstudent: The cameras on iphones are so advanced now. There's no need for any special equipment\nstudent: Thank you!\nstudent: I mostly enjoy creating them.\nteacher: Very cool!\nteacher: Ok, lovely! I want us to look at a C2 writing task (part 1) today and some examples of actual writing (I'm not going to make you write anything! today)\nstudent: Ok! Which book is this?\nteacher: As you probably remember, you've got a few options to choose from in part 1, but part 1 is set for you\nstudent: C2 prof?\nteacher: Could you go to page 24 in the 'teacher's handbook' pdf, please?\nteacher: Yes!\nteacher: It should say 'Part 1 (instructions) Shifting Sands: behavioural change'\nstudent: Ok. I'm on page 24 now\nstudent: Yes\nteacher: Lovely! Could you read the instructions and the two paragraphs, please?\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: and let me know.\nstudent: Done\nteacher: Great. What questions come to your mind, if any?\nstudent: The second text is too hard to read\nteacher: Fair enough, what's the main idea of it though?\nstudent: Individualism is cool ?\nteacher: Pretty much!\nteacher: And the first one is all about, think about others, they might hold different views, culturally\nstudent: Yes. And they probably want you to pick sides\nstudent: And present your argument in your essay\nteacher: Ok, lovely! The task here as you can see is to talk about both points of view and express your own ideas in your essay\nteacher: Or you can come up with a third idea! Some people think A, others think B, but I think C\nstudent: Right\nteacher: Ok, but my aim for today is to give you a glimpse of how different candidates approach it, and what makes a successful essay\nteacher: The essays are assessed in 4 categories. 1. Content (how fully you've answered the question) Is the target reader informed?.\nteacher: 2. Communicative achievement (how easily you communicate what you're trying to say; whether the register and style are consistent throughout .or you suddenly start to use slang etc...\nstudent: What are the other 2?\nteacher: 3. Organisation. A clear organisation is key because it makes it much easier to actually do 1 and 2 .answer the question fully and express your ideas coherently.\nteacher: The elements of organisation are structural (paragraphs, topic sentences to start each paragraph) and linguistic (linkers like 'moreover' etc.. But the structural stuff is probably more important\nteacher: 4. Language (self-explanatory, but note that grammar and vocabulary together are only 1/4 of the mark!)\nstudent: Wow. Tough..\nteacher: Yes, but it's a skill! and very learnable\nteacher: Ok, could you go to page 30, please, and skim the first sample answer (but don't look at the marks underneath yet if possible!) And tell me what you think about it :)\nstudent: OK\nteacher: Ok?\nstudent: Ok. The structure is incoherent, the language has some slang like 'thru'. There's some good vocabulary for sure. But I can't figure out the author's point of view.\nstudent: In terms of punctuation, some commas are lacking\nstudent: I think\nteacher: Yes, I very much agree with you! They bounce from one idea to another, don't they?\nteacher: Have a look at the marks now, please :) they are all out of 5\nstudent: Ok!\nstudent: LOL\nstudent: They assessed it better than I would have\nstudent: But then again, I'm not an examiner ))\nstudent: I disagree that it's cohesive\nteacher: Yeah, they had a bit more time! ))) It's an average of 3 out of 5, which by the way is a pass\nstudent: The use of phrases like 'moreover' and alike doesn't make a text cohesive, does it?\nteacher: Well, the idea is that Cambridge writes these assessments in positive 'can-do' statements. They say it's coherent, but only give it a 3\nstudent: Right.\nstudent: Same with the Language\nstudent: the Language section\nstudent: They complement it and give 2/5\nteacher: They are cohesive devices, words like 'morever'. And the candidate is linking their sentences! But the overall coherence is lacking a bit, I agree!\nteacher: Yep!\nteacher: Ok, you will see a bit more about how it works when we compare with the next two! Could you go to the next page, please? Same idea, read through the essay and don't peek at the marks, please\nstudent: Deal\nstudent: OMG\nteacher: :)) it's not as bad as it looks!\nstudent: Where did the paragraphs go?\nteacher: Yep, that's the main question!\nstudent: I really like it\nteacher: It's good, right??\nstudent: Needs a little brushing up and paragraphs )\nstudent: I wish I could express my thoughts like that =.\nstudent: my thoughts\nteacher: Me too! Again, it's a skill! Have a look at the marks, please :)\nstudent: Oh yes. The marks are good\nstudent: Well done, stranger ))\nteacher: Definitely! I'm guessing 'clear paragraphing' would have pushed it towards 5/5\nteacher: That's what I thought, too :))\nteacher: Ok, we'll skip the next one because we're nearly out of time, but can you have a quick read through the one on page 33, please? same idea :)\nstudent: ok\nstudent: The other one is also good\nteacher: Yes, that's right! Easy to read, isn't it?\nteacher: Feel free to look at the marks :)\nstudent: I did\nstudent: Easy indeed\nteacher: organised impressively and coherently' as they put it. And in a way it's more important than lots of fancy vocabulary!\nteacher: Ok, lovely. I've got to let you go. I hope it's given you a bit of an idea of how this task could be approached? We can have a go at it in real time next week!\nstudent: Yes. Got it. Structuring is crucial\nstudent: crucial\nstudent: Thank you Ms. Rivera!\nteacher: Definitely!\nstudent: Next Thursday then?\nteacher: It's a pleasure. Would you prefer Thursday or Monday?\nstudent: I think Thursday\nstudent: It's calm. There's no one in the school ..\nteacher: Got you! No problem, Thursday it is!\nstudent: Great! See you soon!\nstudent: Have a great weekend!\nteacher: Take care, I'll speak to you then :)\nstudent: You too\nstudent: Bye\nteacher: Thanks, you too :) bye!",
    "teacher: Hello!\nteacher: Sarah, is it you?\nstudent: Hi\nstudent: Sorry\nteacher: Oh hi\nstudent: I've just mixed up the lines for typing ..\nteacher: That's what I thought!\nstudent: haha\nteacher: How are you? How did the first visit to the nursery go??\nstudent: We did it )\nstudent: It looks like Sophia liked it\nteacher: Ok, that's good news!\nstudent: She even played with her new mates (?) on the playground .\nstudent: And then she wanted to go inside to continue games but they were going to have lunch and a nap\nteacher: Ok, that's promising, isn't it?\nteacher: Yes, her new mates is fine!\nteacher: What's it like? Is the group big? Are the teachers nice? Are there any nice toys?\nstudent: \u0415\u0440\u0443\u043a\u0443 \u0444\u043a\u0443 \u0434\u0449\u0435\u044b \u0449\u0430 \u0435\u0449\u043d\u044b.\nstudent: \u0449\u0440 \u0456\u0449\u043a\u043a\u043d\nstudent: sorry ..\nteacher: :))\nstudent: There are lots of toys. The room for kids looks simple and nice\nstudent: The group is quite big. There are 18 kids in the group\nstudent: but today there are 13\nteacher: Sounds good! And one teacher? Or two?\nstudent: The teachers look nice. But you know there are me and the nanny there ..\nteacher: Yes, I know...\nstudent: One teacher and one teaching assistant\nstudent: Also the manager and nurse are nice too\nteacher: Is it a private or state nursery?\nstudent: And Sophia has found two new friends )\nteacher: Sounds lovely!\nstudent: It's a private one\nteacher: Ok, sure. You've decided not to take your chances with the state one?\nstudent: One of these girls even didn't want to let her go home .\nstudent: Oh, sorry\nstudent: It's my mistake\nstudent: I mean it's a state one\nstudent: I don't know why I typed private .\nteacher: Ah, yes, I remember that you wanted to try the state one\nstudent: And it was funny because they had PE with a special teacher\nstudent: IN ENGLISH\nstudent: ))))\nteacher: Oh wow! Like PE? (physical education)\nstudent: He said loudly, step up!\nteacher: That's what it's called in English schools\nstudent: Jump!\nstudent: With a very Ukrainian accent ))\nstudent: *stand up\nstudent: Yes! Like PE .\nteacher: Haha, well, there is a demand for English at nurseries I suppose, so they're trying to keep up\nstudent: But this man looks nice too )\nstudent: But a little bit like \u0444\u0438\u0437\u043a\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0443\u0440\u043d\u0438\u043a ))))\nteacher: Yes, well, he is a PE teacher ))))\nstudent: And children like him I think _\nstudent: a real PE teacher ..\nteacher: That's the most important thing!\nteacher: Is Sophia looking forward to going there on Monday?\nstudent: Yes. She is looki\nstudent: ng forward to going there on Monday definitely\nteacher: Lovely, sounds like the first visit was a success!\nstudent: Because she really wants to play inside with the toys ..\nteacher: Aww, lovely!\nstudent: but then we will see\nteacher: Is she going to go every day for two hours next week?\nstudent: when she explores all thing in the kindergarten .\nstudent: I think she even is going to go for more than 2 hours\nstudent: because after two hours they have a walk\nstudent: (on the playground) is it still a walk?)\nstudent: So maybe she will walk with them\nstudent: I will discuss it with her during the weekend )\nteacher: Well, it's being outside / outdoors on the playground. I wouldn't call it a walk! But I know we do call it that in Russian.\nstudent: Yes, it's quite strange to use 'walk' in English in this case\nstudent: but in Russian it's ok .\nteacher: It is strange, isn't it? A walk is definitely more about going from A to B than just being outdoors\nstudent: agree!\nstudent: but in Russian \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0443\u043b\u043a\u0430 could be on the playground for example .\nteacher: Yes, I know! It's a bit weird if you think about it\nteacher: Ok, you wrote earlier, 'she would like to go inside to continue games' - which sounds like it's about the present, but you need a past form there, don't you?\nstudent: Yes, I do .\nteacher: An easy way to do it just to say 'she wanted'\nstudent: aha\nteacher: A more complicated way is to use a perfect infinitive. She would have liked to go inside...\nteacher: Does this make sense?\nstudent: Aha\nstudent: I prefer she wanted ..\nteacher: I don't blame you!\nteacher: What's the weather like in Kyiv? We're having a pretty rubbish May, very rainy!\nstudent: Ah, sorry for you\nstudent: The weather here is like in May finally .\nteacher: Nice and sunny?\nstudent: The (?) chestnuts are blooming .\nteacher: Yes, the chestnuts are blooming!\nteacher: Ours are blooming too, under the rain ..\nstudent: The weather is sunny and \u0433\u0440\u043e\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f .\nstudent: haha, under the rain .\nteacher: Oh, you're having some thunderstorms?\nteacher: A thunderstorm involves thunder and lightning\nstudent: We are going to have some thunderstormes today, tomorrow and till the end of May .\nstudent: We\nteacher: There isn't really an adjective because 'stormy' just means very windy here, maybe with some rain or snow\nteacher: It must be warm then. Here people believe that thunderstorms happen when it gets hot (which is probably correct, I'm not sure)\nstudent: Oh, poor English ..\nstudent: I think this is right\nstudent: It looks like we have thunderstorms when it's warm\nteacher: Yes, you don't get them in the winter, do you!\nstudent: No, we don't\nteacher: Ok, shall we revise the words from your lovely list, to do with the foods of the future?\nteacher: You've got here: alga - algae, emissions, stem cells, to obtain, intake, to avoid at all costs, sequencing and chewable\nteacher: What's the easiest word out of them all?\nstudent: algae )\nteacher: Haha, I didn't guess then!\nstudent: emission too )\nteacher: Yes, the plural form of\nstudent: alga\nteacher: sorry, algae is the plural form of 'alga', but we usually use the plural form\nteacher: No one talks about poor one alga ..\nteacher: Yes, correct!\nstudent: haha\nstudent: and in Russian\nteacher: We usually use 'emissions' in the plural, too! Especially when we talk about the environment. It's vital that countries cut down their emissions (meaning CO2 emissions and other harmful emissions)\nstudent: \u0432\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043b\u044c?\nstudent: \u0432\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043b\u044f? ...\nteacher: Nobody knows!...\nstudent: hahaha\nstudent: \u043d\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043b\u044c \u0438 \u0432\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043b\u044c ..\nteacher: at all costs' doesn't have to go with 'avoid'. We can also say win at all costs, get it done at all costs etc.\nstudent: aha\nstudent: I see\nteacher: It must be \u0432\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043b\u044c, right?\nstudent: But I like the expression )\nstudent: \u0432\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043b\u044c I think )\nteacher: You like 'at all costs'?\nstudent: yes, I mean the expression\nteacher: Yes, nice and intuitive\nstudent: to avoid at all costs\nteacher: Sure!\nteacher: obtain' is a more formal way to say 'get'\nteacher: to obtain a permission, to obtain a result\nteacher: Sugar is obtained by processing sugar cane (says the dictionary)\nteacher: or sugar beets\nstudent: aha\nstudent: I see\nstudent: I know the word but forget it all the time .\nstudent: I don't know why )\nteacher: It's quite formal! You probably don't hear it very often\nstudent: maybe\nteacher: Ok! 'stem cells' should be quite clear to you, right? It's like in Russian / Ukrainian\nstudent: Yes, thank you\nstudent: I just need to remember the words .\nteacher: And intake is another pretty formal word. We can say, the daily intake of vitamins / fibre etc.\nstudent: fibre?\nteacher: Good question! This word was also in the text I think. Fibre can be found in fruit, vegetables and wholemeal bread, for example. It's important to eat enough fibre for our stomachs to work well!\nstudent: \u043a\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0447\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0430?\nteacher: Yes, you've got it :)\nstudent: thank you )\nteacher: Ok, the words again! alga - algae, emissions, stem cells, to obtain, intake, to avoid at all costs, sequencing and chewable + fibre\nstudent: ok!\nteacher: Can you give me a definition and I will try and guess the word?\nstudent: ok\nstudent: this thing usually grows in the water or near the water )\nteacher: algae!\nstudent: 1 point ..\nteacher: Haha, thank you :)\nstudent: Before you eat something you should to make it smaller. So you have to ____ it with your teeth .\nstudent: And the adjective from the verb is.. ?\nstudent: you eat\nteacher: chew?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Aha, yes, to make it smaller!\nstudent: and the adjective is )\nteacher: chewable!\nstudent: 2 points ))\nteacher: I'm doing well, aren't I?\nstudent: Definitely!!! )) My best student! )\nstudent: ok\nteacher: Thank you!)))\nstudent: they are small parts of people body which are very useful in medicine\nteacher: stem cells!\nstudent: right! ) 3 points! )\nstudent: ok\nstudent: to get but in a formal way\nteacher: to obtain\nstudent: Yes!!\nteacher: Yay!\nstudent: if you don't want to do something\nstudent: you ____________\nteacher: You avoid it at all costs :)\nstudent: Yes!\nstudent: ... me too .\nteacher: Lovely, well done me! (and you :)\nteacher: Ok,  is the usual time on Monday still good for you?\nstudent: Yes!\nstudent: See you then!\nstudent: Thank you!\nteacher: Lovely! Talk to you then, have a great weekend!\nstudent: Have a good weekend XX\nstudent: Thank you!\nteacher: Thank you, bye :))\nstudent: bye ))",
    "student: hi! sorry I will be a bit late today\nteacher: Hi, ok, no worries\nstudent: Hi again\nteacher: Hi Emily!\nteacher: How's it going?\nstudent: I am fine\nteacher: Anything new happening? How's school? LinguaPro Academy? Your business?\nstudent: I wasn't home yet when the lesson started\nteacher: Yes, I figured you weren't home yet. But you're home now, aren't you?\nstudent: yes\nstudent: LinguaPro Academy is fine, a test is coming, school is also good, but as always I am very tired, and in our buisness we tried barter (maybe in English it is a different word)\nteacher: Oh yes, it's still barter in English! What are you exchanging your products for?\nteacher: And do you need any help with preparing for your test?\nstudent: we exchanged our products for PR (I think)\nstudent: I think it would be great\nteacher: PR? Do you mean some marketing?\nstudent: yes, PR\nteacher: PR = public relations\nstudent: hm\nteacher: You don't feel that the definition fits?\nstudent: like we sent a girl our accessories and she made an advert for our shop in stories\nstudent: in Russian it fits\nteacher: Oh yes, I know what you mean.\nteacher: This is called\nteacher: sorry, this is called endorsement in English\nstudent: okie\nteacher: She is going to endorse your product\nteacher: For example, if you see celebrities on TV advertising products, this endorsement\nstudent: (she already did it)\nteacher: But it doesn't have to be a celebrity\nteacher: Ok, sure\nteacher: Good marketing move!\nstudent: thanks\nstudent: now we\nstudent: have more followers\nteacher: Nice, it's working then!\nteacher: Ok, can you tell me more about your test, please? What would you like us to focus on?\nstudent: we have to revise all our units\nstudent: 44470.0\nstudent: and I can send you the photo of it\nstudent: of our book*\nteacher: Oh, I see, it's the final test, isn't it? Makes sense, it's May!\nteacher: Ok, please!\nstudent: I want to focus on grammar and vocabulary\nstudent: wait 2 minutes\nstudent: okie\nstudent: did you receive it?\nteacher: Is it on Skype? One moment\nstudent: yeah, on Skype\nteacher: Aha, cool. Hold on a moment\nteacher: Well, I found some extra practice online. How about you tell me which area of grammar is most difficult for you? If you open the book and look at the list of units, you should see the grammar points for each one\nstudent: okie, wait\nstudent: prepositions, conditionals, verb patterns, phrasal verbs, passive and have smth done\nstudent: in grammar\nteacher: Ok, cool!\nstudent: and I will just study vocabulary by myself\nteacher: Sure. Ok, can you tell me the difference between 'I cut my hair yesterday\nteacher: and 'I had my hair cut yesterday'\nstudent: yes, I cut my hair - I did it by myself, I had my hair cut - somebody did it for me\nteacher: Yes, cool! Ok, I will give you some examples with 'do it myself / yourself' and you change them into 'someone else does it for you'\nteacher: Before the race I really need to fix my bike!\nstudent: I need my bike fixed\nteacher: You can just get rid of 'be'. I need my bike fixed\nstudent: I can use it, but I don't need to, right?\nstudent: *it\nteacher: No, don't use it!\nteacher: Ok, next one! I'm cutting my hair short next time!\nstudent: I'm having my hair cut shorter next time\nteacher: Yes, well done! Jumping from tense to tense here, for practice\nteacher: Tell the manager to clean the swimming pool. (but he is a manager, not a cleaner, he's not going to do it himself!)\nteacher: or herself\nstudent: I don't understand the exercise, sorry\nstudent: what do I have to do?\nteacher: Same exercise! In my sentence I'm telling the manager he needs to clean the swimming pool\nteacher: But we don't mean that he should do it himself! he can get someone to do it\nteacher: Tell the manager to ___ the swimming pool ____.\nstudent: have, cleaned\nteacher: to have the swimming pool cleaned\nteacher: same structure, right?\nstudent: mmm\nstudent: yes\nteacher: I can't repair the washing machine on Sunday\nstudent: I can't\nstudent: have my washing machine cleaned on Sunday\nteacher: Yes, the structure is right! 'repaired'\nteacher: Tomorrow I'm taking some photos\nstudent: oops, sorry about repaired\nstudent: Tomorrow I am having my photos taken\nteacher: Yes, well done! In the first sentence I'm going to take some photos myself, in the second someone is taking photos of me\nteacher: When's your test, by the way? Next week?\nstudent: no, I think in ten days\nteacher: Oops, sorry, I'm back!\nteacher: Ok, we can do some more preparation next Friday then, that's good!\nstudent: okay, thank you very very much!\nteacher: Ok, I'm looking at verb patterns now\nteacher: We still have 5 minutes!\nteacher: We arranged (go) to the theatre. (to go / going / go?)\nstudent: going\nteacher: Noo, to go\nteacher: arrange to do something\nteacher: There isn't much logic to verb patterns I'm afraid, you just need to learn them like vocabulary\nstudent: okay.\nteacher: I feel like (eat) a tub of ice cream and (watch) a movie!\nstudent: eating, watching\nteacher: Yes!\nteacher: Tim invited (us / visit) him in Scotland\nstudent: us to visit\nteacher: Yes! well done\nteacher: My dad let me (stay up) and watch a film\nstudent: stay up\nstudent: there is a mistake, my dad letS me..\nteacher: Yes, there is no 'to' after 'let' and 'make'. And help sometimes!\nteacher: Nope! The three forms are let-let-let. It's past simple :)\nteacher: but I like that you're alert :)\nteacher: Ok, lovely, we'll practise some more next week!\nstudent: okay, thank you for your help again!\nstudent: goodbye!\nteacher: Bye, no worries, it's my pleasure!\nteacher: Have a nice weekend!\nstudent: You too!",
    "student: Hello Mr. Bennett!\nteacher: Hi Sarah!\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: I'm fine. Thanks! And you?\nteacher: Fine, thank you! I'm having my covid jab today, yay!\nstudent: Quick question: what's the English for '\u043f\u0430\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0432 \u043f\u0435\u0441\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0435'?\nteacher: Haha, you have the best questions! let me think\nstudent: Yay! Happy for you!!!\nteacher: sandcakes or mudcakes in a sandpit\nteacher: Thank you! I'm over the moon!\nstudent: Thank you! And what about the forms for sandcakes?\nstudent: moulds?\nteacher: Yes, moulds!\nstudent: What type of vaccine are you getting\nstudent: ?\nteacher: I'm getting the Pfizer one\nstudent: So sandcake moulds, right?\nstudent: Pfizer - triple yay!\nteacher: Yes, or sand castle\nstudent: And what about \u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u043a\u043e and \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043b\u0438.\nstudent: I found many translations\nteacher: Haha, there was some cartoon I saw the other day, about different vaccine camps vs. Hogwarts houses. I think it was something like Pfizer is Griffindor and AstraZeneca is Hufflepuff :)\nteacher: I'd be pleased with any, to be honest\nteacher: a bucket and a rake\nstudent: Thanks! This is super useful\nstudent: You know it is\nteacher: But I would say culturally English kids tend to build sandcastles. Maybe they haven't got the same association with tall Easter breads\nstudent: haha. Funny about the vaccines / Hogwarts houses\nstudent: What is Slytherin then?\nteacher: Well, they definitely haven't I mean. Do you think pasochki come from the Easter cakes?\nteacher: Sputnik is Slytherin! ...\nstudent: haha I'm laughing out loud\nteacher: I know.... it's hilarious\nstudent: And Ravenclaw is Moderna I reckon\nteacher: It must be! I can't remember now..\nstudent: Do you remember the name of the cartoon?\nteacher: No... it could have been one of New York Times cartoons, I'm subscribed to them on Insta. Or it could have been one of those satirical articles!\nteacher: I'll look it up in a minute!\nteacher: I'm about to have a really odd weekend! Mr. David Roberts and Emily are going to visit his parents, and I'm staying at home (I do get on with my in-laws, it's just I won't have the immunity from tonight's jab yet)\nteacher: It'll be the first time in a long long while that I'll be at home on my own for two days\nstudent: Oh my! Actually, it's a dream come true\nstudent: What plans do you have?\nteacher: It is for parents of very young children like you, I was the same (she said patronisingly :))\nstudent: Are Mr. David Roberts and Emily already vaccinated?\nteacher: I'm a bit pathetic about it! Haven't got any nice plans. I would normally go to the cinema, but again, won't have the immunity yet. I do have a round of camembert to bake, with some crusty bread, and a tub of Ben&amp;Jerry's\nstudent: haha. Right. But frankly I cannot imagine a night without Sophie by me at this point\nteacher: Mr. David Roberts is and Emily doesn't need a vaccination apparently\nteacher: Exactly!\nstudent: How about watching some silly romcom that Mr. David Roberts won't agree to watch with you?\nteacher: It'll have to be something like that, yes! Or rewatching Hamilton yet again :)\nteacher: Ok, can you guess what I've got for you today?\nstudent: Cool! I wish I could watch it somewhere\nteacher: Writing part 1 (the summary) to do in real time\nstudent: Nooooooooo\nstudent: I object..\nteacher: Mmm, my sister should be able to help\nteacher: How strongly?\nstudent: Medium strong ))\nteacher: It's on Disney+, you could get a free 8-day trial of Disney+ :..\nstudent: Oh! Got it. Thanks for the tip!\nteacher: Yes, Mrs. Karen Johnson knows more I think. We're both huge fans!\nstudent: Thanks! I'll write to her\nteacher: Well, shall we just make a plan? For the essay? A good plan is half the battle :)\nstudent: How about we do some tests? =)\nstudent: But if you insist\nteacher: Go on, I feel like we've got this unclosed gestalt :))\nteacher: Ok, I've just re-send you the paper. Could you open it at page 2, please?\nstudent: No unclosed gestalt. Just my life-long resistance to writing essays\nteacher: We can do it!..\nstudent: I guess.\nteacher: And then - I promise! - no more writing, just tests\nstudent: Ok.\nteacher: Can you see the task?\nstudent: Where?\nstudent: The book from last time\nteacher: Oh sorry! I've just emailed it to you (it is from one of the previous lessons)\nstudent: Got it\nteacher: Ok, could you read through the paragraphs in part 1?\nstudent: So I should do the same as the people from Sample Essays\nstudent: ok\nteacher: Well, let's say the mission for today is to come up with a nice plan. But if you are dead against writing the essay, I'm not going to make you! It's supposed to be fun for you\nstudent: Ok, let me first draw up a plan then\nteacher: Ok, as you remember, you don't need to say in the summary, the author of the first paragraph thinks that, the second thinks that, and I think something else\nstudent: 1. Some people think ads are fun and can brighten up both city and rural landscapes, can be informative and help\nteacher: You can just steal their ideas and weave them into your essay\nteacher: Yes!\nstudent: 2. Others think their ubiquity is annoying, even dangerous at times, especially towards vulnerable groups of people\nteacher: Yes! Love 'their ubiquity is annoying', great for your topic sentence\nstudent: 3. I think ads are OK when there's an option to mute or cancel them. In real world it's almost impossible to achieve. Thus, I only support ads on the internet\nteacher: Excellent! a very clear point of view, easy to write about\nstudent: and I prefer my city streets and my countryside trails ad-free\nstudent: Thank you\nteacher: You probably need a couple of sentences for an introduction. Something like 'outdoor ads have become a subject of heated debate' etc.\nstudent: Right.\nteacher: On the level of vocabulary, which linkers could be used? I can think of 'Some argue that...' 'Meanwhile...'\nstudent: Since the dawn of advertising people have been debating over whether the ads are an abomination or a necessary evil. something like that?\nteacher: Ooh, brilliant!\nstudent: Yes. 'It is argued', 'Moreover', 'It is stated that...', 'Some believe that' ....\nteacher: an abomination, a necessary evil or an opportunity? (maybe, from a business point of view)\nteacher: Yes, excellent!\nstudent: Yes! I was looking for a third option actually\nstudent: Thank you\nstudent: I was planning to write it in a separate sentence\nteacher: I'll save this sentence then, beauty!\nteacher: Sure, you can do that too! Go ahead :)\nstudent: But I like how you put it!\nteacher: Up to you!\nteacher: Ok, I'll copy your plan and your lovely intro sentence. But seriously, would you like to do it in the chat next time? Or shall we switch to something else? I have no intention of torturing you! (but I do think you can write a beautiful essay!)\nstudent: Thank you. Let's try then!\nstudent: To write it\nteacher: Lovely! Next Thursday same time then?\nstudent: Yes! Great!\nstudent: Good luck with your jab!\nteacher: Thank you very much! Have a lovely weekend! :)\nstudent: I hope you won't feel a thing during the procedure and after it\nstudent: You too! Bye\nteacher: Thank you, I'm determined to be brave though! ))\nstudent: Everything will be OK!",
    "student: Hi Ms. Johnson!\nstudent: How are you?\nteacher: Hi Sophie Miller!\nstudent: How are you feeling?\nteacher: I'm good, thank you. My arm is a bit sore and I'm a bit tired (but that could be even without the vaccine)\nteacher: I mean, it's not necessarily a side effect :)\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: Oh! Very good\nstudent: to be tired it's ok I think )\nstudent: And yes, it could be not a side effect\nstudent: I'm fine\nteacher: How's Liam? I'm amazed at how well she seems to be settling at the nursery!\nstudent: I feel tired too because of the kindergarten .\nstudent: Liam is ok but this morning she looked tired too\nteacher: Yes, I get that, Thomas's always tired by the end of the week!\nstudent: but we decided not to miss the day of kindergarten this week\nstudent: And we asked the nurse to call us\nteacher: if she is not happy?\nstudent: and she called about 1,5 hour ago and told me that Liam looked tired and like she was tired of lots of kids and noise\nteacher: Oh I see, yes I understand! Are you going to pick her up earlier then?\nstudent: And her nanny picked her up from the kindergarten\nteacher: Oh, the nanny picker her up, yes, makes sense!\nstudent: and Liam even decided to go to the playground with her nanny\nstudent: so it looks like she is not really tired physically but mentally\nstudent: *Liam\nteacher: Yes, I know what you mean!\nstudent: she is not used to being in crowded places\nteacher: Yes, naturally!\nstudent: I'm not sure about the grammar .\nteacher: How are you? How are you finding this whole kindergarten experience this week?\nteacher: Oh sorry, she is not to being!\nstudent: I think everything is ok for the first week .\nteacher: I used to do something .= I did it in the past but not now.\nteacher: I'm used to doing something (it's my habit now)\nteacher: *she is not used to being\nteacher: Sorry, I'm missing words. It must be the effect of the vaccine :)))\nstudent: But I feel exhausted at the end of the week .\nteacher: I bet you are!\nteacher: Have you got any nice plans for the weekend?\nstudent: Tomorrow\nstudent: I just want to lie in\nteacher: to lie in, yes!\nteacher: I hope you'll be able to!\nteacher: It's lie-lay-lain (lying)\nstudent: And then we would like to go for breakfast to our favorite place with a terrace in Kyiv\nstudent: It is called Vero Vero\nstudent: *then\nstudent: Before the Covid times we had breakfast there every weekend in the summer\nteacher: Ooh, sounds lovely!\nstudent: and we are going to the cinema with Liam on Sunday\nstudent: it will be her first time in the cinema )\nteacher: I'm jealous! What are you going to watch?\nstudent: We think on Sunday morning it won't be crowded there\nteacher: I wanted to take Thomas to the cinema too in a couple of weeks, when I have some immunity. But it doesn't sound like fun anymore! You have to be wearing a mask and you have to pre-order all the food\nstudent: We can buy food there without pre-ordering\nstudent: we have different rules here\nstudent: The name of the cartoon is Raya and the Last Dragon .\nteacher: Yes, you've got different rules, that's right! We might still go in the summer\nteacher: Ooh, my sister says it's really really good!\nstudent: has she watched it? .\nteacher: She has!\nstudent: I'm not sure that the cartoon isn't too 'adult' for Liam\nstudent: But we will see )\nteacher: I hope you'll both enjoy it. It's on our list to watch with Liam too, once it's free on Disney+ :.\nteacher: Ok, I've got something fun for you today! Expressions with 'make' and 'do'\nteacher: Fun, right?\nteacher: You know how we say 'do some work / do my job' but 'make a mistake' for example?\nstudent: Yeah! )))\nteacher: There are words that go with do and words that go with make. Sometimes there's (a little bit of) logic, but not always!\nstudent: Yes, I know, but I think sometimes I can make some mistakes ..\nteacher: That's it.. I thought it would be a good idea to revise them a little\nteacher: Ok, can you think of any nouns that go with 'make'? Like make a mistake\nstudent: make a cake )\nteacher: Yes!\nstudent: I don't know really ..\nteacher: No worries! In fact, everything to do with food preparation. Make a cake, make some coffee, make a cup of tea, make dinner / breakfast / lunch\nteacher: make borshch ))\nstudent: ok )\nstudent: Make popcorn)\nteacher: Exactly!\nteacher: That's why the machines are called, for example, a waffle-maker / a popcorn-maker\nstudent: aha, I catch the idea .\nteacher: Then we have some business words. A business can make a profit or make a loss\nstudent: \u0444\u0440\u0444\nstudent: sorry . aha\nteacher: Then there's an idea of saying something. Make a noise / make a comment / make a speech\nstudent: ok )\nteacher: And then things that I can't classify :)\nteacher: make a promise, make an apology, make a complaint\nteacher: make progress, make a change, make a mistake\nteacher: make a phone call, make a plan, make a mess\nteacher: make friends, make love, make an excuse\nstudent: oh! there's a huge number of them )\nstudent: number\nteacher: I'll stop here!\nteacher: Oh, a business can also make money!\nstudent: I see!\nteacher: Have you got any questions about any of them?\nstudent: make a mess\nstudent: like not clean?\nstudent: a mess sorry\nteacher: Yes, if you make a place untidy, you've made a mess\nstudent: \u0428 \u044b\u0443\u0443\nstudent: I see\nstudent: thank you!\nteacher: But also metaphorically, he forgot what he was going to say and made a mess of his presentation\nteacher: Do you know 'make an excuse'?\nstudent: like \u0438\u0437\u0432\u0438\u043d\u044f\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f\nstudent: ?\nteacher: Noo, that's make an apology\nstudent: Ah!\nstudent: I see now\nteacher: If you make an excuse, you give a reason why you can't do something or haven't done something\nteacher: For example, sorry, I can't come to your party, I need to feed the cat\nstudent: \u043d\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0443\nstudent: something like that I think\nteacher: Sometimes the excuse is the real reason and sometimes it's just what people say to get out of a something they don't want to do!\nteacher: Hmm, like povod or opravdaniye maybe\nstudent: I see .\nstudent: \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043b\u043e\u0433!\nstudent: I found the word )\nteacher: Yeah!! Well done you!\nstudent: I just googled it ))\nteacher: Sure\nteacher: I couldn't think of that\nstudent: it's not my \u0437\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0433\u0430 )\nteacher: Anyway, some expressions with 'do'!\nstudent: ok! )\nteacher: A lot of things to do with housework\nteacher: to do the housework, do the dishes, do the laundry, do the cleaning, do the gardening\nteacher: But! make beds and make meals (as you remember)\nteacher: Then we have things to do with studying\nstudent: ok\nteacher: do your homework, do an exam, do a test, do a task, do an exercise\nteacher: Do + Ving\nteacher: do the cleaning, do the cooking, do the shopping, do some painting\nstudent: aha\nstudent: thank you\nteacher: And some types of sports as well\nteacher: like do yoga!\nteacher: If you can't play them (like football), you usually do them (like yoga or swimming or weight-lifting)\nteacher: Oh, to do a course is another one that goes with studying\nstudent: aha\nteacher: Ok, and then things to do with work: do some work, do your best, do a job\nteacher: Finally, things I can't classify..\nteacher: do damage, do harm, do somebody good\nstudent: oh no ..\nteacher: For example, regular exercises will do you good!\nteacher: not many though..\nstudent: do harm?\nstudent: Ah I see\nteacher: Not exercising will do you a lot of harm!\nteacher: :))\nteacher: Finally, do someone a favour\nstudent: so it could be classified like \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u044f \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a\u0430 .\nteacher: Yes, not only for a person though! The storm was terrible but luckily it didn't do any damage\nteacher: to the house\nstudent: Sure! I didn't think about it )\nteacher: No worries\nteacher: And if you do someone a favour, you help them\nstudent: aha! thank you!\nteacher: Also, it's a way of asking for help. Could you do me a favour and buy a bottle of milk for me when you're doing your shopping later?\nstudent: aha . it's not very useful for me I think\nstudent: because of milk\nstudent: )))\nstudent: it's a joke )\nteacher: Haha, sorry, I forgot!\nteacher: Ok, I'm leaving you with a whole list of words today!

Is it next week?\nstudent: yeah, next Monday and Wednesday are test days\nstudent: that\u2019s me on another device\nteacher: Two days of test? But when't the day of watching a movie during the last class? :)\nteacher: Ok, sure!\nteacher: *when's\nstudent: well, I am not sure, but I think next week is the pre-final week\nteacher: Aah, I see! And then it's probably test feedback and a movie / party\nteacher: What's the word for something that's last but one? (pre-final)\nteacher: pe.........\nstudent: uh\nstudent: I don\u2019t remember\nteacher: penultimate\nteacher: that's ok\nstudent: remind me please\nstudent: *p\nteacher: penultimate\nstudent: oooh yes\nteacher: Yes :)\nteacher: a nice word\nteacher: Ok, shall we go back to our verb patterns for your test then?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Because we arranged (have) another preparation class today, didn't we?\nstudent: having\nteacher: to have!\nteacher: arrange to do something\nteacher: Ok, next one\nteacher: You won't persuade me (go) to the concert with you\nstudent: going\nteacher: to go\nteacher: arrange / persuade to do\nstudent: you see, it is a problem for me.\nteacher: My Dad let me (stay up) until late\nstudent: stay up\nteacher: Yes!

The three forms are let-let-let\nstudent: oh\nteacher: No worries!\nteacher: Ok, what's the difference between I remember calling my mum vs. I remember to call my mum\nteacher: ?\nstudent: maybeee calling my mom is what you always do and remember to call is you only need to do it now\nteacher: Hmmm, nearly! I remembered to do something = I thought, oh I should do it and did it!\nteacher: When I was at a supermarket, I remembered to buy a new notebook. (I had needed a notebook and luckily I remembered to buy it!)\nteacher: but: I remember doing something = I have a memory of how I did it\nteacher: I remember calling my mum very clearly, we talked about my sister\nteacher: Does it make sense?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: And the same with forget!\nteacher: Don't forget (call) when you get home\nstudent: to call\nteacher: Yes!\nteacher: I will never forget (meet) her for the first time\nstudent: meeting\nteacher: Yes, correct!\nteacher: Let me see what else is in your book\nteacher: Carol pretended (like) the show but I think she was bored.\nstudent: to like\nteacher: yes\nteacher: They're planning (build) a new theatre here\nstudent: to build\nteacher: Yes!\nteacher: I don't know if I can persuade him (try) skiing with me\nstudent: to try\nteacher: Yes)\nteacher: I arranged (see) my friend at the weekend\nstudent: to see\nteacher: Yes, that's right!\nteacher: Ok, let me see what's the next thing on our to-do list\nteacher: Aha! Future forms, just what we were talking about a couple of weeks ago\nteacher: Ok, could you fill in will / shall / going to?\nteacher: What ____ we do if the environment gets worse?\nstudent: shall\nteacher: Hmm, the answer is 'will'. Why not shall, what do you think?\nstudent: I don\u2019t actually remember if we studied something with shall, so can you remind me please?\nteacher: Yes, of course! It's unit 4 according the english file website\nteacher: Shall we do something?' is a suggestion for us to do something\nteacher: #ERROR!\nteacher: but 'will we do?' is an actual question. If the environment gets worse, what will we do? what is there for us to do?\nteacher: Shall we go to the cinema at the weekend? (=let's go)\nteacher: Will we still go to the party together if we are not friends anymore?\nteacher: Am I explaining it well? Shall we = let's ... will we = actual question\nstudent: okay\nteacher: ____ we watch this documentary about pollution?\nstudent: Shall\nteacher: Yes!\nteacher: That's the cleaner at the door, I ____ let him in.\nstudent: will\nteacher: Yes, that's right\nteacher: Ok, and then we have first and second conditionals. You haven't actually done third conditionals at Linguafocus this year, have you?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: Ok, what are the first and the second conditionals about then?\nteacher: Remind me..\nstudent: well, first conditional talks about things that might happen\nteacher: Yes, good use of 'might'!\nstudent: and second is about talking about something in the future that won\u2019t be true, maybe my dreams\nteacher: Yes, or at present actually. Things that are not true but we could still think about them\nteacher: I wonder what I ____ do if I ________(be / not) a teacher\nstudent: would, wasn\u2019t\nteacher: Yes! or 'weren't'\nteacher: to highlight how unrealistic it is, we sometimes use 'were' for all persons in the second conditional\nteacher: If you could choose the subjects to do at school, which subjects would you choose (or not)? give me a full sentence, please\nstudent: If I could choose, I would choose PE , Ukrainian (literature and language), English, but I think it is just my favorite ones, we don\u2019t need all school subjects, but also we need somebody to teach us for example how to pay bills\nteacher: Oh yes, you mean to teach you some practical skills?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: to teach someone to do something, actually (the verb pattern)\nteacher: Ok, lovely\nteacher: If you could travel anywhere in the world this summer, where would you go?\nstudent: If I could travel, of course I would go to Israel and I would be very happy if we travelled to Spain or\nteacher: Sure!\nteacher: Ok, if you finish your test at Linguafocus early, what will you do?\nteacher: (which conditional is it?)\nstudent: first\nstudent: If I finish early, I think my teacher will let me go home\nteacher: Yes, lovely!\nteacher: Present simple + if will\nteacher: Ok, Sophia Davis, best of luck for the test!

    "student: Hi Miss Johnson!\nteacher: Morning!\nteacher: My laptop is being rubbish this morning - sorry! I'm on my phone again until it recovers\nstudent: How are you?\nteacher: How are you?

Did you have a lie in? What did you have for breakfast?\nteacher: A ferris wheel!\nteacher: I didn't know there was a ferris wheel there, it must be new!\nstudent: I lay in a bit :)\nstudent: Yes! It's new!\nstudent: I mean it has been there for several years\nstudent: you can see the pictures on the Internet )\nteacher: It __ __ there for several years\nstudent: there is there' is not right ) I think\nstudent: It has been there?\nteacher: Yes, that's my idea of new too :)\nteacher: Yes! Correct :)\nstudent: ok\nstudent: breakfast was lovely\nstudent: but they didn't have any croissants unfortunately\nteacher: That's a shame!\nstudent: despite the fact that they have them on the menu )\nteacher: Ah, typical!\nstudent: Sophia wanted to eat one\nteacher: Despite the fact they have them on the menu\nstudent: usually they don't have this problem\nstudent: it is quite an expensive place and usually the service is great\nteacher: They must have run out of croissants!\nstudent: So I was surprised\nstudent: expensive\nteacher: I see! Yes, disappointing!\nstudent: also now there is a market at weekends on Kontractova ploscha\nstudent: with lots of hand made things\nstudent: and lovely food from small businesses\nteacher: Oh, like on Andriivskiy?\nteacher: Sounds lovely\nstudent: it is something different I think\nteacher: I'm going to try to switch to my laptop, bear with me, please\nstudent: it is not just Ukrainian traditional things or souvenirs\nstudent: but usual things like bags, clothes, food, sweets\nstudent: ok!\nstudent: bear with me! Nice expression )\nteacher: Hiya\nteacher: Yes, people use it a lot, especially if they're providing some sort of a service, to say, please wait\nteacher: For example, a receptionist is trying to find your booking and her computer isn't working, so she says, please bear with me\nstudent: I like it\nstudent: Ok\nstudent: so!\nteacher: It seems to be working! The other Miss Johnson is going to leave now\nstudent: then we spontaneously decided to invite Emily and her family to our place\nstudent: And it was so surprising to us that Sophia and Sophia played together without us\nteacher: Haha, that's always so nice!\nteacher: How old is Sophia? I forgot\nstudent: and we just looked at them and ate pizza and drank kombucha ..\nstudent: Sophia is 9 months older than Sophia .\nstudent: months\nstudent: But in the evening kids were so tired\nstudent: and then\nteacher: That's lovely!\nstudent: On Sunday morning\nstudent: Sophia was sick\nstudent: Sophia\nteacher: Oh no!!\nstudent: She has a runny nose and high temperature\nstudent: It looks like the result of the first week in the kindergarten\nteacher: Oh poor her! Yep, it totally looks like that!\nstudent: So no cinema yesterday of course\nteacher: Oh that's a shame!\nstudent: Jason's mom gave her a check-up\nstudent: it looks like a usual \u041e\u0420\u0412\u0418\nteacher: Yes, I see\nstudent: I don't know the term in English\nteacher: Well, it's just a cold in English :)\nstudent: Today she still has a runny nose but in the morning she had a usual temperature\nstudent: Ah, I see ! A cold )\nstudent: So we decided it is not dangerous for her nanny and the nanny came today\nteacher: Yes, kids recover so fast, don't they?\nteacher: Well, the nanny should be used to kids' colds\nstudent: But we decided if Sophia feels worse I'll return earlier from work\nstudent: Miss Johnson : Well, the nanny should be used to kids' colds - Yes, she should!\nteacher: Sure. I hope she'll get better very soon!\nstudent: Thank you!\nteacher: Ok, lovely! Shall we revise our do / make?\nteacher: I'll give you part of an expression, and you insert do or make, ok?\nstudent: ok!\nteacher: ___ the laundry\nstudent: do the laundry!\nteacher: Yes!\nteacher: ___ the shopping\nstudent: do the shopping!\nteacher: Yes.\nteacher: ___ dinner\nstudent: make a dinner .\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: ____ a loss / profit\nstudent: make\nteacher: Yes! ____ money\nstudent: make!\nteacher: That's right! Oh, I think I forgot this one last time, can you guess it? ___ love\nstudent: make love\nstudent: you wrote it\nteacher: Yes! Oh did I? Sorry! Like 'make love not war'\nteacher: You know, the effects of the vaccine :)\nstudent: isn't it like have sex?\nteacher: I won't be able to make this joke for much longer!\nteacher: Yes, of course!\nteacher: It does mean to have sex\nstudent: Ah! ))))\nstudent: I see now\nteacher: By the way, 'make a joke'!\nstudent: actually\nstudent: what about the side effects?\nstudent: effects\nstudent: any from Friday?\nteacher: Oh, I feel very lucky, my arm was sore and I had a little bit of a headache, but I took some paracetamol and felt ok! Thanks for asking\nteacher: Lots of people have worse side effects it seems\nstudent: I'm happy that you feel well )\nstudent: is it the right expression? )\nstudent: I remember we talked about feel good and feel well )\nteacher: Yes, it is, thank you!\nteacher: Oh sorry, feel well = about physical health\nteacher: But I feel good too today! It finally feels like summer here\nstudent: Ok, so I'm happy that you feel well!\nteacher: Thank you :)\nteacher: Ok, the next one! ____ a test / exam\nstudent: do!\nteacher: yes!\nteacher: ____ your best\nstudent: do your best!\nteacher: Correct:)\nteacher: make ___ a list\nstudent: hm\nstudent: sorry\nstudent: make a list? )\nteacher: that's right!\nteacher: yes\nteacher: like 'make a to-do list'\nstudent: Ah!\nteacher: or make a shopping list\nteacher: Does it make sense now?\nstudent: Yes! I see now!\nteacher: ___ some exercise\nstudent: Make a to-do list is my second name ))\nteacher: Oh really? Interesting! We can talk about it in a second\nstudent: as well as to make a shopping list )\nstudent: do some exercise\nteacher: to make a shopping list!\nteacher: yes, correct\nstudent: Oh sorry\nstudent: make\nstudent: I don't know why I typed to do ))\nteacher: ___ a speech / comment\nteacher: no worries\nstudent: make a speech / comment\nteacher: Lovely!\nteacher: Ok, let's practise them by taking turns to ask each other questions using one of the expressions. I'll start! Do you like making to-do lists?\nstudent: I love to make to-do lists!\nstudent: And you? )\nteacher: No, I don't make them, actually! I only make lists when we're going to travel, the lists of what to pack. If I don't make a packing list, I have to be thinking about what to pack all the time!\nteacher: Do you make your to-do lists every day? or every week?\nteacher: And I make shopping lists, of course\nstudent: I make to-do lists all the time )\nstudent: what to do in the morning, at work, in the evening )\nteacher: I see! You're very organized!\nteacher: Ok, can you ask me a question using one of the expressions, please?\nstudent: I think it is just the quality of my brain and memory\nstudent: If I don't make a to-do list I will forget half of my errands\nteacher: I see! An errand is a very good word here\nstudent: Thank you\nstudent: I asked for help from my colleagues ))))\nteacher: Haha, please say hi to them :)\nteacher: Ok, your question, please!\nstudent: Ok\nstudent: Do you make your coffee in a coffee machine? .\nstudent: your\nteacher: Good question! Yes, we make coffee in a coffee machine, a fiter coffee maker. We bought it at the beginning of the first lockdown and we've been using it every day since!\nteacher: My turn! Who does the cooking in your family?\nstudent: Me! ))))\nteacher: Sure!\nstudent: Ok, I do the cooking, but sometimes Jason makes some meals when I would like to  lie in )\nteacher: Perfect! do the cooking but make some meals, absolutely correct\nteacher: Your turn, please\nstudent: and when Sophia has a cold for example and doesn't let me go .\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: Sure, that sounds familiar\nstudent: and in your family do you just do the baking or do you make meals too?\nstudent: do you make\nstudent: is better\nteacher: I make breakfast and some of the meals and I bake, yes, but David's been doing most of the cooking since he started working from home. Again, since the beginning of the pandemic\nteacher: I make some Ukrainian meals. For example, I'm making a nettle and sorrel soup tomorrow\nstudent: Oh, lucky you .\nteacher: I know! :)\nteacher: I do appreciate it\nstudent: but sometimes our nanny does the cooking too ))\nstudent: So I feel ok with it )\nteacher: That's a good arrangement!\nteacher: Ah, time! I've got to let you go. Are we ok for Friday, the usual time?\nstudent: Ok!\nstudent: I have to think\nstudent: maybe another day\nstudent: can I write you later?\nteacher: Yes, of course! I hope Sophia will feel better soon! Have a nice week!\nstudent: Thank you!\nstudent: You too\nteacher: Thanks, take care!\nstudent: bye XXXX\nstudent: thanks!",
    "student: Hi Ms. Taylor!\nteacher: Hi Emily!\nteacher: How are you today?\nstudent: Fine, thank you\nstudent: )\nteacher: Haha, I can see that!\nteacher: How's Sophia? Feeling better?\nstudent: Yesterday she was better, just with a runny nose\nstudent: But today she has a temperature of 37\nstudent: I'm quite upset\nteacher: Oh no, I bet you are upset!\nstudent: I've corrected my name )\nstudent: corrected\nteacher: Yes!))\nstudent: I've felt nervous for the last two days in general\nteacher: Is she quite tired? Or is she alright in herself?\nstudent: I think it's because of the nanny's holiday etc\nteacher: Yes, it's a big change to the routine!\nstudent: She is alright in herself and so I was surprised that she had a high temperature today\nteacher: I see! Is she home with the nanny?\nstudent: And I wanted to joke about my mood )\nstudent: Do you know about the full moon? and other things like that\nteacher: Oh, yes, the full moon! Some people believe it affects how they feel (and many other things)\nstudent: Mercury retrograde )\nteacher: full is the opposite of empty\nteacher: but a fool is the opposite of a clever person :))\nstudent: ah\nstudent: hahaha\nstudent: )\nteacher: It was the full moon yesterday, I saw it!\nstudent: so I think my mood is because of this stuff ))))\nstudent: Ok\nstudent: Sophia is with her nanny now, but maybe I should go home earlier today\nteacher: Ok, I've got some information for you. We're finishing the teaching program on June 18. As you probably remember, we'll take a week off next week, and then we can still have chats for two weeks afterwards\nstudent: I will see when I contact the nanny\nstudent: Connect? Is it too formal?\nstudent: ?\nstudent: Like \u0441\u043f\u0438\u0448\u0443\u0441\u044c \u0441 \u043d\u044f\u043d\u0435\u0439 in Russian\nteacher: I think you mean 'contact the nanny'?\nstudent: I will message to nanny?\nteacher: You can just say 'I'll talk to the nanny' or I'll message her, yes\nstudent: contact, yes )\nteacher: Are you ok to continue with the class today? And will you be ok for chats between June 7 and June 18, considering the nanny will be on holiday? You can always let me know later!\nstudent: to continue with the class today? - what do you mean, sorry?\nteacher: I mean, you said maybe you had to go home earlier!\nstudent: I'll let you know because I would like to continue with the kindergarten when Sophia get well\nstudent: And I have to see how the process will go\nteacher: Yes, sure! Makes perfect sense. We can discuss it at the end of next week!\nstudent: Ah, sorry! Maybe I confused you. Now I am at work and can chat with you. I meant to go home earlier in the evening/\nteacher: Ah, ok, sure :)\nstudent: Sorry )\nteacher: No worries\nstudent: will you have school holidays next week?\nteacher: Yes, that's right!\nstudent: and then?\nteacher: It's called 'half-term' here (a week off in the middle of a school term; there are three terms in an academic year in the UK)\nteacher: And then I will still be teaching for two more weeks, or at least that's the plan\nstudent: and then? How long will kids be learning for this year?\nteacher: Oh, I see! 7 more weeks after that! Until July 23\nteacher: And then 6 weeks of summer holiday\nstudent: it is so unusual for us\nteacher: It seems very short to me\nstudent: Here kids already have summer holidays\nteacher: Yes, I know! But at the same time, I have no idea what parents would do if children were off for three months like in Ukraine\nteacher: You know, the system of babushkas is not as well developed here :)\nstudent: I see )\nstudent: Actually the system doesn't work properly for me )\nteacher: No? Because both Sophia's grandmothers are working?\nstudent: Yes!\nteacher: Yes, I see! What did you do during your summer holidays when you were at school?\nteacher: Did you stay in Kyiv?\nstudent: When I was at preschool\nstudent: Usually I went to my grandmas and granddads\nstudent: But when I was older usually I stayed in Kyiv and\nstudent: oh sorry\nstudent: and spent time with my friends )\nteacher: That makes sense! Do I remember correctly that you had some family in Chernihiv?\nteacher: (did I spell that correctly?)\nstudent: Yes!\nstudent: Yes twice! )\nteacher: Good for me :)\nstudent: And another granny in Koselets. It is a small city between Kyiv and Chernihiv\nteacher: Sounds lovely!\nstudent: Looks more like a village )\nstudent: With animals etc .\nteacher: Nice!\nstudent: And how did you spend you summer time?\nstudent: by the sea?\nteacher: Linda and I were very lucky to have a grandma who lived on the Southern Coast\nteacher: Crimean\nteacher: so yes, by the sea! magical summers\nstudent: Wow!\nstudent: What is the name of that place?\nteacher: Simeiz\nstudent: I know it! It's a beautiful place!\nteacher: Oh really? Have you been?\nstudent: Hm\nstudent: let me think\nstudent: I don't think so\nteacher: Ok, you've never been ___ Simeiz then\nstudent: I've been to Gaspra\nteacher: what's the preposition?\nteacher: Oh yes, Gaspra is not far away!\nstudent: Ok, you've never been to Simeiz then\nteacher: Yes, well done! :)\nstudent: ok\nstudent: Can I ask you a question\nstudent: I?\nteacher: Yes, sure!\nstudent: Do I have to use 'to' all the time after have been?\nstudent: Or can I use in?\nstudent: I remember we were talking about it but I forgot\nstudent: shame on me )\nteacher: Good question! Remember we talked about the difference? I've been to London 3 times vs. I've been in London for three months now\nstudent: \u0429\u043b\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: I've been to London = I've visited\nteacher: I've been in London = I'm still in London!\nstudent: So maybe I remember clearly. So if you are in the place you use in\nstudent: and if you left the place you use to\nstudent: Ok\nteacher: Yes, if you're talking about your past visits to the place, it's I've been to\nstudent: I see\nstudent: thank you\nstudent: for explaining one more time )\nstudent: so\nstudent: I think I have been to Gaspra\nstudent: is it near Simeiz?\nteacher: No worries. Yes, correct!\nteacher: Well, not very near, Alupka is the closest. It's maybe 20 km away or so?\nteacher: I'm not sure!\nstudent: also I've been to Foros\nstudent: another nice place there\nteacher: Ok, I've got a bit of new grammar for you!\nstudent: ok! )\nteacher: Oh yes, definitely! Foros is about 30 min aways from Simeiz\nteacher: It was very weird in 1991, when Gorbachev was held in Foros, it was very close to us!\nstudent: so I've even been to Foros )\nteacher: I remember even though I was very young\nteacher: Excellent!\nstudent: Actually I've been there in 1991 I think )\nteacher: Haha, not a good summer to go there!\nstudent: hahaha )\nteacher: Ok, a bit of new grammar before we have to go! And we can practise it some more in two weeks' time\nstudent: ok! )\nteacher: I painted my bedroom   vs.   I had my bedroom painted\nteacher: Do you know / can you guess what the difference is?\nstudent: \u042f \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u044e \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0443\nstudent: \u041c\u043e\u044f \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0430\nstudent: ?\nstudent: Ah\nstudent: maybe no\nteacher: No?\nstudent: Ah\nstudent: ok\nstudent: not finished action\nstudent: and finished\nstudent: the first one is about the process\nteacher: Good guesses, but no!\nstudent: and the second one is about the result\nteacher: It's about who does the action\nteacher: I painted my bedroom = I did it myself\nstudent: Ah\nstudent: I see now\nstudent: aha\nteacher: I had my bedroom painted = I paid someone to do it for me\nstudent: it is clear\nteacher: As you can see, the model is 'have something done'\nteacher: I cut my hair  vs.  I had my hair cut\nteacher: (you don't even need to say who did it, it's clear that it was probably a professional)\nteacher: He fixed his car   vs.  He had his car fixed\nteacher: etc. etc.\nstudent: I see\nstudent: I had my face massaged )\nteacher: Yes, exactly!\nteacher: Good one!\nstudent: )\nteacher: Do you do your nails yourself or do you have them done at a salon?\nstudent: Now I do my nails myself but before the Covid times I had my nails done at a salon )\nstudent: *times\nteacher: That makes sense, perfect!\nteacher: Do you shop at a supermarket or do you have your shopping delivered? )\nteacher: (different verbs but you get the idea!)\nstudent: I have my shopping delivered usually\nstudent: And you?\nteacher: Me too, I have it delivered!\nteacher: Ok, I'm going to give you some phrases in brackets and you complete the sentence using the 'have something done' model, ok?\nteacher: We usually   (the bedrooms / redecorate) every two years. score\nteacher: Sorry, ignore 'score', please\nstudent: ok\nstudent: We have the bedroom redecorated every two years\nteacher: Yes, well done!\nteacher: Sarah isn't making her own wedding dress, she   (it / make) by a designer in Italy.\nteacher: (the tense here is present continuous)\nstudent: ... she is having it made by\nteacher: Well done! it was a tricky one\nstudent: haha\nteacher: (you / ever/ anything / steal) from your house?\nteacher: you'll have to guess the tense by yourself :)\nstudent: Have you ever had anything stolen..&amp;\nstudent: ?\nteacher: Nearly!\nteacher: Have you ever ___ anything stolen...\nstudent: had\nteacher: Yes! well done :)\nteacher: Ok, lovely, I'll send you the rest of the exercise as homework, ok?\nstudent: with the second try )\nstudent: Yes! Thank you!\nteacher: Hope Sophia will feel better very soon! And we'll stay in touch as always\nstudent: Thank you!\nstudent: See you\nstudent: have a good week\nteacher: Take care, bye! :)\nstudent: bye xx\nteacher: Thanks\nstudent: thank you!",
    "student: Hi Ms. Emily Henderson.!\nteacher: Hi Olivia!\nteacher: How are you? How was your trip?\nstudent: Hi! I am good thank you :) It was great! A bit tiring though: we met with a lot of relatives...\nstudent: How about you? How are you?\nteacher: Sounds lovely!\nteacher: Well, I had my first dose a week ago, so yay!\nteacher: of the covid vaccine I mean\nstudent: Of course...Austria just sent the appointments to everyone who asked for the vaccine: I am getting my first dose in a month :)\nteacher: Otherwise, we keep waiting for some sun, maybe we'll finally glimpse it this weekend\nteacher: Yay! A wait, but at least you have a date I suppose\nstudent: That's true! The weather was terrible in Italy too...we had only two days without rain\nteacher: Really? Well, if even Italy is all rainy, it kind of makes me feel a bit better :)\nstudent: Haha...in Italy we have a saying 'mal comune, mezzo gaudio' (a common pain is half a joy)\nteacher: Haha, exactly! :)\nteacher: I wonder what the saying is in English, there should be something...\nstudent: But I didn't have time for the writing, sorry...we really travelled a lot!\nstudent: misery loves company...maybe\nstudent: (I found it with google, I didn't know it)\nteacher: No worries! I'm taking the next week off teaching because my son will be on holiday, so if you still want to do it, you'll have some extra time\nstudent: That's great! Agreed!\nteacher: Yes, kind of 'misery loves company', hmmm\nteacher: But the Italian one is more joyful!\nstudent: Yes, at least it mentions something that isn't misery..\nteacher: Lovely! Also, I am sad to say that we will be closing the teaching project on June 18, which means that we will only have the time for two classes, between June 7 and June 18\nstudent: I see :) Okay, well it was a nice opportunity so I can only be thankful for it\nstudent: And I am curious to see what sort of research they do on the papers: I'll follow the professor who I first contacted for this opportunity ;)\nteacher: Yes, it's been a pleasure on my part, and of course, we are very grateful to our volunteer students like yourself\nstudent: It's been a pleasure for me too!\nteacher: I think they're taking the research in more than one direction at the moment. Yes, I'm sure you can contact Dr. Jasmine Chen for more information if you're curious, he did mention it\nstudent: Cool, thank you :) It would be cool if I eventually end up also working on the data I contributed to generate...\nteacher: Ok, so the question is, what would you like to focus on in our remaining time? I've been planning to look at some more speaking questions from C2 proficiency today\nstudent: (If they release it openly)\nstudent: Okay, let's look at speaking questions!\nteacher: Yes, Dr. Jasmine Chen would be a better person to speak to about this than myself!\nteacher: It would be cool if I eventually end up working also on the data I contributed to generate\nteacher: I feel that 'also' is a bit out of place here. What would be a better place for it?\nstudent: Oh, 'also' is in the wrong position there, right?\nstudent: Yep\nteacher: haha, yes! You see it yourself, don't you?\nstudent: I could either remove it, or...maybe...I could put it before 'working': end up also working ...\nteacher: Yes! I like it before 'working'.\nstudent: Yes and no...but now, everytime I write it an alarm bell rings in my head so I try to pay more attention (not in that case, apparently)\nteacher: also working' - like other researchers\nteacher: It's German interference, isn't it? I can just hear 'arbeiten auch' in my mind\nstudent: Yes...moreover German has an interjection which is written 'also', has a slightly different sound...\nstudent: The way we use 'anche' in Italian, which is the closest word to 'also' we have, is also different...\nteacher: Aah, yes, I remember! indeed\nstudent: So it is really tricky for me ;)\nteacher: I can imagine!\nstudent: *the closest\nstudent: Anyway, practise makes perfect :) As you see if I think about it I am starting to correct it!\nteacher: Ok, C2 questions! I think I mentioned last time that there are several parts to the speaking test, and in the first part the questions are focused on you rather than abstract\nteacher: I'm warning you, some of them are a bit weird, you'll have to just roll with them and show off your English!\nstudent: Okay, that's fine!\nteacher: You'll see what I mean (I'll start with not so weird ones though)\nteacher: The test always begins with, please tell us your name, are you a student or do you work and then maybe 'where are you from', no need to answer those now\nteacher: Next question: You said you are from Friulli (did I get that right??) Is that an interesting place to live?\nstudent: Those are the easy ones..\nstudent: Yes, I am originally from Friuli (just one 'l').\nteacher: yep, they give the examiner a chance to fill in the papers :)\nteacher: Sorry! Friuli\nstudent: It depends on what you mean by 'interesting'. It is a small, rural region which was among the poorest in Italy before the so called Italian economic miracle of the sixties...\nteacher: Ok, lovely! Feel free to add another sentence or two\nstudent: I find it interesting because you can experience nature in all its forms: from mountains to the seaside...and, as any place in Italy, it has many places that are interesting as far as history is concerned. For instance Trieste, with castle Miramare, or Palmanova: a small city which still has the original footprint from the Middle Ages\nstudent: and looks like a star, surrounded by its walls, when you look at its map.\nstudent: In this sense it is quite interesting :) But I would use the word quiet to describe it: if you look for a thrilling night life you should look somewhere else.\nteacher: Ok, thanks! Great sophisticated grammar, I like it! It would be helpful to use some synonyms to 'interesting' though, such as...\nstudent: (maybe when you see an aerial view would be a better way to say 'look from a map')\nteacher: what comes to your mind?\nteacher: Yes, sure, because you mean 'look at its map', but an aerial view is a better expression!\nstudent: Oh..I didn't think about synonyms...this is a trick I should remember...\nstudent: To be honest I don't have many synonyms...maybe stimulating, in certain contexts?\nstudent: noteworthy\nteacher: Yes, you would probably use 'interesting' in real life, and so would a native speaker, but you aren't scoring any points with it in the test as you can imagine!\nstudent: Okay! But I should probably exercise with synonyms because it isn't that easy (even when looking at Italian synonyms for help ;) )\nteacher: I find it interesting... could be replaced with something like 'it appeals to me'\nteacher: noteworthy is a good one! and then all kind of descriptive adjectives, like 'fascinating' etc.\nteacher: There is a lot unpack / explore in terms of history etc.\nstudent: Indeed...I should exercise by paraphrasing questions\nteacher: Ok, let's try another one!\nstudent: into ones that use more refined terms.\nteacher: exactly, with that in mind\nteacher: How good are you at organising your time?\nstudent: Scheduling my day is a fundamental task for me: I have a busy life, with two small children, and I can't expect things to work out without any planning.\nteacher: Excellent! great paraphrasing\nstudent: Therefore I'd answer saying I am good at planning my day, even when this means handling unexpected events.\nstudent: Which are common among parents of small children.\nteacher: Lovely! A good expression: firefighting (especially in the work context)\nteacher: dealing with problems that pop up unexpectedly\nteacher: Too much time is spent firefighting rather than moving the business forward.\nteacher: an example from the dictionary\nstudent: Oh, that's a lovely expression!\nstudent: And I am not sure I've ever encountered it...I'll write it down :)\nteacher: Yes, very useful! My husband says it all the time, when he's annoyed that he hasn't made any progress because he's been firefighting the minor crises\nteacher: Ok, the next one!\nteacher: What would you dream job be? (they are eliciting conditionals and the grammar of speculations like could / might  here!)\nstudent: If I had the possibility to go back in time, I would try to focus my efforts into becoming a pilot with the final objective of becoming an astronaut.\nstudent: I might have actually attempted to follow this passion of mine if it had not been for my parents who are scared of flying...\nstudent: and made it very clear that, if I was to fly, they would be in a constant state of alert and fear.\nstudent: (okay, I exaggerated a bit, but it was just to show off some language)\nteacher: Excellent!\nteacher: Just one objection. Third conditional: I might have attempted, it it ___ ___ ___ for my parents (because it's in past)\nteacher: *in the past\nstudent: if it were not for my parents?\nteacher: if it had not been!\nteacher: The pure third conditional is 'past perfect, if would / might / could have V3'\nstudent: okay..I guess I'll have to check it again..\nteacher: I'll make a note, if we've got some time left, we can do a bit of third conditional practice in June\nteacher: But otherwise great!\nteacher: Ok, are you ready for the weird one?\nteacher: How important is the internet for you?\nstudent: I must say I was expecting a weirder question...\nteacher: Really? I've got to up my game :) I thought this was weird!\nstudent: The internet is fundamental for me: sometimes I am scared when thinking about how much of my activities rely on it: from working, to listening to music and shopping...\nteacher: The best answer to this would be, 'Excuse me, inte... what?'\nteacher: Sorry, go on!\nstudent: I can hardly move a stone without connecting to some server to check how many steps I've taken today or using a neural network to try and identify the species of the insect that is strolling across my porch...\nstudent: Haha...Agreed! I'll write down that answer...\nstudent: Maybe 20 years ago...\nteacher: No, don't write it down! :))\nstudent: Nowadays even driving a car often relies on an internet connection, if not for the driving itself, at least for the directions\nteacher: Love the vocabulary! brilliant!\nteacher: And you managed to avoid using the word 'important'))\nstudent: I was joking ;) Thank you! I must say that I should exercise a bit, as currently my words are stirred more by the will to produce outstanding English rather than saying what I mean to say haha\nstudent: But, as you said, the examiners don't know anything about me, they are there only to evaluate my English\nteacher: Exactly! I wouldn't worry about truthfulness here!\nstudent: Good :) I guess I have to go now, right? What time in 2 weeks?\nstudent: I should be available again on Tuesday\nteacher: Will Tuesday suit you?\nteacher: Tuesday June 8?\nstudent: Yes\nstudent: At 1 pm?\nteacher: Lovely, at 1 pm?\nteacher: Yes, absolutely, because I won't have to reload the chatroom afterwards\nstudent: Perfect! See you then...enjoy the vacation!\nteacher: Great, I'll speak to you then! Thank you :)\nstudent: And thank you!! Bye!!\nteacher: Bye!",
    "student: Hello Ms. Ramirez!\nteacher: Hi Emily Smith!\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: How are you?\nstudent: I'm good. It's raining cats and dogs right now in Kyiv\nteacher: Good, thank you!\nteacher: Oh really? It's been raining here for days, I'm so fed up with it!\nteacher: But they're promising ___ sun for the weekend!\nstudent: Does it generally rain often where you live?\nteacher: the / a / 0 article?\nstudent: Yay!\nstudent: the sun\nstudent: oh no\nstudent: sun\nteacher: No, we're the 'dry counties' of the east!\nstudent: That's great\nteacher: Yes, exactly, 0 article because I mean 'sunshine', don't I\nteacher: So basically, all the rain and wind move in from the Atlantic, Ireland and the west of the country get hit worst but it loses a lot of its force by the time it gets to the east\nstudent: Yes! I remembered\nstudent: but only after I wrote 'the sun')))\nteacher: It? they? the rain and wind, so they! sorry!\nteacher: It still counts!\nstudent: Haha I didn't even notice)\nstudent: No worries\nteacher: Thank you!\nstudent: Which part of England is hit the most then?\nstudent: I mean, has the heaviest rains\nteacher: The west, definitely! That's where storms are the worst. And Wales, too. Wales is the rainiest part of the UK I think\nstudent: Noted\nteacher: I've been so fed up with all the rain, but then, my Italian student just told me it had rained non-stop in Italy as well, so I'm a bit more reconciled with it now :)\nstudent: Noted - not my travel destination then))\nteacher: Haha, well, it's supposed to be beautiful, but I've never been. Very green (because of all the rain)\nteacher: like Ireland :)\nteacher: I still don't dare travel to Scotland even though it's supposed to be breathtakingly beautiful, for the same reason\nstudent: Sure. Must be good for plants\nteacher: That's it!\nteacher: Ok, unfortunately, I've got to tell you that we're closing down the teaching program on June 18. Also, I will be taking next week off (Sophia's going to be on holiday), which leaves us two classes between June 7 and 18\nstudent: Oh no!\nteacher: We will get on with the writing now, but for the other two, please let me know if there's something you'd particularly like to do!\nstudent: Are you OK with them closing the program?\nstudent: Yes, the writing... )) Let's try\nteacher: Yes, it's a shame for me too, it's been such fun! And we're very grateful to our volunteer students like yourself :)\nstudent: It has been a blast!\nteacher: It certainly has!!\nstudent: I'm really going to miss our classes\nstudent: You're the best teacher\nteacher: Aww, thank you! Yes, me too! I love our conversations!\nstudent: Well! I hope we'll continue conversing from time to time but on Facebook in a more relaxed setting, preferably an essay-free one))))))\nteacher: Definitely!! I promise no essays on Facebook :))\nstudent: Joking ^.^\nstudent: Yay!)))\nstudent: Ok. Then it's time to finally write it\nteacher: And we do hope to go to Kyiv at some point! Maybe next Easter...\nstudent: Oh! That's fantastic news. If you do come, I really hope to meet you all\nteacher: Yep! Have you got the writing paper handy? Could you re-read the two paragraphs about advertising? And I'll retrieve the sentences you wrote last time\nteacher: That would be great!\nstudent: ready with the paper\nstudent: paper\nteacher: Lovely!\nteacher: Since the dawn of advertising people have been debating over whether the ads are an abomination or a necessary evil.  1) Some people think ads are fun and can brighten up both city and rural landscapes, can be informative and help  2) Others think their ubiquity is annoying even dangerous at times, especially towards vulnerable groups of people  3) I think ads are OK when there's an option to mute or cancel them. In real world it's almost impossible to achieve. Thus, I only support ads on the internet\nstudent: I'm terribly sorry to ask for the millionth (?) time but could you possiblyt tell me again the pages and the name of the book\nteacher: This was the plan from the last time\nstudent: possibly*\nstudent: Did I write this?\nstudent: Whoa\nteacher: No worries! It's the writing sample paper pdf that I emailed you last time!\nteacher: So it should be in your inbox\nteacher: Right? As I keep saying :))\nstudent: Ok I've got it\nteacher: Lovely! Could you re-read the paragraphs about advertising, please?\nstudent: So I read again. Then try to write an essay including my previous sentences\nstudent: Ok, sure\nteacher: Yes! I think this first sentence could be a good start, what do you think?\nteacher: Since the dawn of advertising people have been debating over whether the ads are an abomination or a necessary evil.\nstudent: Agree\nteacher: Feel free to add a couple of sentences for the intro\nstudent: One quick question\nteacher: Sure\nstudent: What do you think the author means by 'digital advertising' in the second article?\nstudent: Digital billboards\nstudent: or internet ads\nstudent: I mean, digital billboards on the streets\nteacher: That's a good question, I've been thinking myself! I think they mean digital billboards, because it needs to correlate with the first paragraph\nteacher: and the contrast is, posters in the past vs. digital billboards now\nteacher: or at least it must be!\nstudent: Ok. So it probably correlates with the previous article\nstudent: article\nteacher: Yes, it should! Two views of the same thing\nstudent: If that's not the case then I would have argued differently. Hence the question\nteacher: So let's stick to the idea of digital billboards\nteacher: Aha, I see! How?\nstudent: Yes.\nstudent: haha\nstudent: I need to think\nstudent: think\nteacher: Sure!\nstudent: Something about the fact that there's no escape from the advertising frenzy, neither online, nor offline. And you'll have to become immune at some point and maybe teach your children to do the same, see through things\nstudent: neither ... nor\nteacher: Yes, I see!\nteacher: Your original point was that we have no choice when exposed to billboards, we can't block them like on the Internet\nstudent: Yes.\nteacher: Shall we go at paragraphs one by one, and then you choose which idea you'd like to express? or potentially both\nstudent: That's if we think about digital boards on the streets\nstudent: I'd like to continue expressing the first one\nstudent: So I have to write by hand the whole essay now, right?\nteacher: I think it's a very promising one, easy to write about!\nstudent: Yes, much easier.\nteacher: Can you type it here, please, sentence by sentence? You've got the first sentence!\nstudent: Here? OK!\nteacher: And I'll be saving them for you\nstudent: in 2 mins I'll start, Ok?\nteacher: Sure!\nstudent: Ok. Ready to start\nteacher: Lovely!\nteacher: Since the dawn of advertising people have been debating over whether the ads are an abomination or a necessary evil.\nteacher: the first sentence again\nstudent: It is hard to imagine a single day when you're not bombarded with advertisements, in one way or another.\nteacher: Yes, 'bombarded with' = lovely!\nstudent: You may think it's necessary or you may be appalled - one thing is clear, there's little you can do about it. However, this is only partly true for the virtual world.\nteacher: Right, I'm just thinking... are we still in the introduction part?\nteacher: There's surely more than one way about it, but shall we say for now,  1)a general introduction 2) opinion 1 3) opinion 2 4) your opinion\nstudent: I'm positive that even the biggest and most loyal fans of the advertising world, who consider ads to be fun, informative and overall a charming addition to both city and rural landscapes - even those people have an ad-blocker installed on their PCs.\nstudent: Maybe omit 'even those people'?\nteacher: Ok, that's a great sentence, but you are going back to billboards, aren't you??\nteacher: yes, a comma after landscapes and 'have an ad-blocker...'\nstudent: I'm trying to continue what I wrote last time.\nstudent: Or we're doing a new version?\nstudent: So I need more introduction then, right?\nteacher: No, you're right, we're building on the old one!\nteacher: I would say so, and then proceed to the next paragraph that can start with a topic sentence\nteacher: Boring, but well-structured!\nteacher: Ah, I've got to let you go! Shall we continue in two weeks' time?\nstudent: Sure. I'll try to maybe write it on my own\nteacher: Sure, feel free to email it to me then!\nstudent: Thank you!\nteacher: Ok, lovely. Thursday June 10, same time?\nstudent: That's right!\nteacher: Great! Looking forward to it!\nstudent: See you soon!\nteacher: Bye!",
    "student: Hi!\nteacher: Hi Melissa Smith!\nteacher: Everything alright with the chatroom for you?\nstudent: I tried to use it a few seconds ago and I couldn't change my name, but now it is working, thanks.\nstudent: How are you?\nteacher: Oh good!\nteacher: Fine, thank you! It's summer here at last, we've had a week of non-stop sunshine!\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: I'm fine thank you! It looks like summer has arrived here too!\nstudent: Even though we still had a couple of storms...\nstudent: with hail and everything\nteacher: Have you guys been mostly unlocked now?\nteacher: Hail? Sounds extreme!\nstudent: In my experience it is fairly common in summer storms...\nteacher: I hope it doesn't materialize here, it would hurt my plants!\nstudent: anyway we have been somewhat unlocked, but there are still many restrictions...and, since I am still waiting for my jab, I have to do a covid test in order to do many things\nteacher: When do you think it might be your turn for the jab?\nstudent: Haha...indeed, hail is a big problems for plants...I have an appointment for the end of the month!\nstudent: But here they didn't go stricly following age order, so I know people who are younger than me and already had their first shot...anyhow, end of the month is better than never ;)\nteacher: I see, it's a wait but at least there's some certainty now, isn't it?\nteacher: Yes, exactly!\nteacher: We're having a bit of a problem that you mentioned before, younger people seem reluctant to get vaccinated...\nstudent: Yes, indeed...at least now I know when I'm getting it...moreover cases are going down nationwide so it's becoming less of a worry\nteacher: Good! Ours are up again, especially among unvaccinated people...\nstudent: Unfortunately the communication from media and politicians played a lot on the fear of the vaccine, because it was an easy way to get readers and attention...\nstudent: I am sure this situation fueled the distrust towards vaccines...\nstudent: I've heard...and, as far as I know, you are also dealing with a new variant...\nteacher: Yes, I absolutely agree with you. Plus some tinfoil hat theories (do you know this expression?)\nteacher: Yes, the Delta variant...\nstudent: I didn't know the expression, but 'tinfoil hat' reminds me of some weird headgear worn by somewhat crazy people...so I am pretty sure I know what you are talking about\nteacher: Sorry, my Internet's just recovering\nstudent: No problem...hopefully your laptop will work properly this time ;)\nteacher: Yes, I think a tinfoil hat originally meant a crazy person, but now it mainly means someone who believes in cospiracy theories spread through the internet\nteacher: Sorry, it's being a bit clunky, but seems to be working\nstudent: I have seen a video of conspiracy theorists who were literally wearing tinfoil hats to protect them from technology reading their minds...or aliens...\nteacher: Hi Melissa Smith, I'm on my phone now. How annoying!\nstudent: ...which, to me, makes them at least a bit crazy.\nstudent: Sorry to hear that :(\nteacher: Hopefully, it will be fixed in a minute\nteacher: Soo, have you had a chance to do the writing? I've got some grammar stuff for you if not :)\nstudent: Unfortunately not :( But since the next lesson will be the last one, I promise you I'll do it tonight so you have time to read it and give me some feedback\nteacher: Haha, I've just read your comment about people wearing tinfoil hats :)\nteacher: Yes, great! Only if you'd like or think this would be helpful, obviously, we can always do something else instead\nstudent: No, I believe this is a good opportunity to get my writing reviewed...\nteacher: Ok, in this case let's have a look at the grammar used to describe unreal situations in the past (or a mix of past and present)\nteacher: There's the basic rule, but also some nice expressions around it\nstudent: (is everything okay with your connection, Ms. Patel? I don't see you as a connected user for most of the time)\nteacher: If I _ _ the house earlier, I _ _ _ late (but I was!)\nteacher: I'm connected! And will hopefully be back on my laptop in a minute\nteacher: But I do see that I'm not a connected user for some reason\nstudent: If I had left the house earlier, I wouldn't have been late.\nteacher: Yes, perfect!\nteacher: Sometimes the reason is in the past, but the result in the present\nteacher: If I _ _ (invest) in Zoom last year, I_ _ a millionaire now\nstudent: If I had invested in Zoom last year, I would be a millionaire now.\nteacher: Yay, I'm back!\nteacher: Here's hoping it'll work, so sorry about the disruption!\nteacher: Absolutely, yes\nteacher: Sometimes the perceived reason is in the present, but the result is in the past!\nteacher: If I ____ such an idiot, I ___ ____ invested in Zoom last year\nstudent: If I hadn't been such an idiot, I would have invested in Zoom last year. (but in this case I am not so sure)\nteacher: Possible! But also: If I wasn't / weren't such an idiot, I would have invested...\nteacher: I still feel that I'm an idiot, so it's the grammar of an unreal situation in the present\nteacher: Have you got the 'Grammar and Vocabulary' book handy? The one with the orange cover (a pdf)\nteacher: If not, I'll email it to you again\nstudent: Yes I have it, one moment\nstudent: (I even bought it for self study, but now I'm not home so I have to use the pdf)\nteacher: Great, could you go to page 89, please (in the pdf)? = page 88 in the actual book\nteacher: It should be Section 4, Past conditionals\nstudent: Yes, Section 4 past conditionals, right?\nteacher: Exactly! Could you read this page, please, and note any nice expressions / points of interest here?\nstudent: Well, the formal structure using 'were' sounds new to me\nteacher: Ok, sure!\nstudent: Were you to have stopped and considered, you'd have seen the error of your ways.\nteacher: Were you to have stopped and cosidered?\nteacher: Oh yes, I see, sure!\nstudent: By the way, I am a bit perplexed by the example, since it is supposed to be formal and yet it uses a contraction - you'd\nteacher: It's an inversion too! It could have been a more straightforward 'If you were to have stopped and considered'\nteacher: Good question! I think the speaker is assuming a more formal language here because they are addressing the audience from the moral highground\nteacher: :))\nteacher: Like a schoolmistress scolding a child\nteacher: Rather than a formal letter / piece of academic writing where we wouldn't expect contractions\nstudent: I see, okay...anyway I believe the other inversion, the one with have, e.g., 'had it not been for you' is more common\nstudent: Okay, I see!\nteacher: Ok, sure! It sounds more familiar then\nteacher: I know you know and use 'If it hadn't been for...', which is a very good expression too\nteacher: or, if we omit if, 'had it not been for...'\nstudent: I see...the other thing that sounds new to me is the 'false conditional', as in 'If you were in the area, why didn't you come and visit?'\nstudent: What's a false conditional?\nteacher: Yes, it's not an unreal situation, because 'you' really were in the area!\nteacher: If I was in Austria, we could have a cup of coffee and catch up\nteacher: this is unreal\nteacher: unreal present\nstudent: I see..\nteacher: If you were in the supermarket, why didn't you get some coffee? (I ask my husband who just told me he had been to the supermarket)\nteacher: for example\nteacher: Do you see? He really was in the supermarket!\nteacher: And I'm using the past simple to describe this situation\nteacher: as opposed to past simple for an unreal situation in the present, to highlight how unreal it is\nstudent: I see...so if you were to tell him 'If you had been to the supermarket, why...'\nstudent: it means you are assuming he wasn't really there, right?\nteacher: If you had been to the supermarket = exactly, this is unreal!\nstudent: I see...okay!\nteacher: Ok, sure. It's a tricky one!\nteacher: Ok, could you go to the next page, please? Ex. 3\nstudent: Okay...\nteacher: Yes, could you write the sentences here, please?\nstudent: a. If it wasn't for the visual effects, the show wouldn't have been worth watching.\nstudent: b. Had it not been for my parents encouraging me, I would have never got so far.\nteacher: Ok, can you put the whole of a. in the past, please? including the 'if' clause\nstudent: c. If you hadn't forgotten the most basic rule of Safety First, you wouldn't  be lying in this hospital bed.\nstudent: a. If it had not been for the visual effects, the show...\nteacher: c = perfect\nteacher: a. yes to the if clause!\nteacher: but in both a and b there's the same pesky mistake after 'would'\nstudent: e. If the goolkeeper wasn't so brilliant, we would have lost by many more.  (I'll think about d in a minute...I am not too sure about this one)\nstudent: Okay, let me check a and b\nstudent: is it a word order mistake?\nstudent: *word order\nteacher: No, it's not! you need 'would HAVE been / got'\nteacher: You did it correctly in e though\nstudent: Oh...I don't know why I was using the past everywhere...I see...\nteacher: No worries, it happens!\nstudent: d. She would have been working from 8 till 8 every day, had she taken that job.\nteacher: Yes, perfect! I like the inversion too\nstudent: f Were you to turn left at the lights, you'd have got here ten minutes earlier.\nteacher: Ooh, what a tricky one! f\nstudent: g. Were it not for the child being only twelve, he'd have been prosecuted. (ugh)\nteacher: This looks like 'were you to turn left...' is about the present / future, but it's in the past, right? Because they didn't turn left and didn't get here ten minutes earlier!\nstudent: you'd have got here\nteacher: To put it in the past, we can use the 'perfect infinitive'. Were you to have turned left a the lights,...\nteacher: No, you'd have got here is correct!\nstudent: Oh...to have turned, okay\nstudent: Indeed that's tricky\nteacher: Oh, actually, it's like in the example they're giving. Were you to HAVE stopped and considered\nstudent: which are in the past tense...I see\nteacher: Yes, correct!\nstudent: okay...The last one is also tricky, this exercise was hard...\nstudent: h. There could have been a potentially very ugly incident, had it not been for the police showing great restraint.\nteacher: h = correct!\nteacher: Ok, I've got to let you go! Thanks for persevering through my technical problems and good work today!\nstudent: Thank you! It was a pleasure...see you in a week, right?\nteacher: Yes, absolutely!\nteacher: Have a nice week :)\nstudent: Thank you for the lesson, bye bye &amp; have a nice week!\nteacher: You too, bye! :)",
    "teacher: Hi Emma Johnson!\nstudent: Hello Ms. Rodriguez!\nstudent: The internet is bad on my side\nstudent: How are you?\nteacher: Hi, ooh I can see that, yes\nteacher: Fine, thank you!\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: Haha, it says there are three of us in the chat))\nstudent: I'm fine too! Thanks!\nteacher: Yes, no problem, you must have logged in twice\nstudent: How was your holiday?\nteacher: Lovely, thank you! We went to Ikea and also to the seaside, which sadly meant being stuck in a huge traffic jam\nstudent: Oh no\nstudent: How long did it take you?\nteacher: Lesson learned: don't go to the seaside on the first nice weekend of the summer, just after the lockdown :))\nstudent: Ikea is always a good Idea)))\nteacher: It took us 3 hours to get home, instead of just over an hour!\nstudent: OMG. Terrible\nstudent: How did Hannah take it?\nteacher: Yes, you must be used to traffic jams though, as a city-dweller?\nstudent: I remember when we got stuck in a traffic jam with Sophia)\nstudent: What a fantastic memory it is))))\nteacher: In his stride, bless him! An audiobook helped, and a promise of KFC for dinner, lol\nstudent: Normally yes, I'm used to short jams\nteacher: Haha, oh goodness, I can imagine!\nstudent: Ahaha KFC for dinner -- anyone would behave\nteacher: Well, exactly! :)))\nstudent: This, however, was an exception. Took us forever to get out\nstudent: Sophia was really irritated(\nteacher: How old was she then?\nstudent: Emma Johnson got bored and left the room)))\nstudent: She was around 1\nteacher: Yes, I've noticed :)) Can't blame her, she never got to say anything\nstudent: A difficult age for this type of situations, I think\nteacher: Is she ok with car seats? Or does she fight for her freeeedom?\nteacher: Oh absolutely!\nstudent: Actually, she enjoys cars and likes riding in them\nstudent: She can stare out of the window for an hour\nteacher: That's nice!\nteacher: Oh yes, I remember! At passing cement mixers :)\nstudent: That incident was just too much. We were so slow\nstudent: That incident was *\nstudent: Haha! Oh yes. And ambulances, and tractors\nstudent: Can you make plural with 'ambulance' by the way?\nteacher: Yes, of course! ambulances\nstudent: Thanks\nteacher: No worries. So, where are we with the writing? Shall we go back to it?\nstudent: I forgot all about it (\nstudent: Is today our last class?\nteacher: No problem )) Would you like to do it now? I've got your sentences. Or not? (either is fine by me!)\nteacher: No, we've still got one class next week if it works for you!\nstudent: Yes, It does\nstudent: Ok, let's try to finish the essay\nteacher: Ok, lovely! As you probably remember, it was all about 'digital advertising', but they just meant advertising on big screens in cities, like billboards etc.\nstudent: Yes!\nteacher: We've got a plan!\nteacher: 1) Some people think ads are fun and can brighten up both city and rural landscapes, can be informative and help  2) Others think their ubiquity is annoying even dangerous at times, especially towards vulnerable groups of people  3) I think ads are OK when there's an option to mute or cancel them. In real world it's almost impossible to achieve. Thus, I only support ads on the internet\nteacher: And the first sentence of the introduction:\nteacher: Since the dawn of advertising people have been debating over whether the ads are an abomination or a necessary evil.\nteacher: And a sentence that, now that I'm looking at it, I think would work in part 3\nteacher: I'm positive that even the biggest and most loyal fans of the advertising world, who consider ads to be fun, informative and overall a charming addition to both city and rural landscapes, have an ad-blocker installed on their Pcs.\nteacher: (your opinion that is) What do you think?\nstudent: Right. The structure is a mess))\nteacher: Is it? I thought it was a good plan! and sentence 2) is a great topic sentence\nstudent: But one sentence is clearly too early\nstudent: You are right\nstudent: Can you tell me approximately how many sentences I need to add\nstudent: *without do\nteacher: Do you mean the sentence about the ad-blocker? Yes, I think it supports your argument for the last paragraph, doesn't it?\nteacher: Ooh, one second, I'll just check the word limit, I've started to doubt. How about you add one / two more sentences to the introduction while I do that?\nteacher: Since the dawn of advertising people have been debating over whether the ads are an abomination or a necessary evil.\nteacher: something to go after this, keeping it general but focusing in on your topic)\nstudent: Ok. I'll take 10 minutes and come back to you, ok?\nstudent: I think it'll be easier if I write it in another editor altogether\nteacher: Yes, sure!\nteacher: The word limit is 280-320. To give you an idea, your first sentence is 20 words\nstudent: Got it!\nstudent: I'm on it\nteacher: Sure!\nstudent: So I started rewriting it and it got me in a different structure other than what we originally discussed, but I like it better I guess.\nteacher: Ok, I'm intrigued!\nstudent: I'll send you the intro\nstudent: Since the dawn of advertising people have been debating over whether ads are an abomination or a necessary evil. Being subjected to the advertising frenzy on a daily basis, we, the city-dwellers, who are constantly bombarded with ads on the streets as much as online have no choice but to take a stand: adapt and survive or move to the countryside. The latter is no guarantee of a life completely void of advertising, however. There\u2019s always the Internet, should you choose to be on it.\nteacher: Ok, sure! In which direction are you planning to proceed?\nstudent: I'll probably talk more about how you can adapt to ads in the city - where you can't control what's being adverstised. And I'll talk about  how you can adapt on the Internet where you have plenty of tools to manage ads.\nstudent: And I'd say something about the little percent of people who think ads are fun and can brighten up both city and rural landscapes, can be informative and help\nstudent: That if you're not part of these few .2 percent)) here's what you can do.\nteacher: Haha, ok! You need to summarize both points of view though!\nstudent: Both?\nteacher: Also, I would caution you against going too deep into discussing internet ads! Because this is not the topic they want you to write about. So I would keep it to one sentence where you compare outdoor advertising to the one on the Internet where you have more control. Otherwise you're risking not addressing the topic!\nteacher: Yes, summarize both points of view and give yours!\nstudent: I see\nstudent: Ok. I'll think about it before next class\nstudent: Thank you\nstudent: by both points you mean 'people who like street ads' and 'people who don't'\nteacher: Write an essay summarizing and evaluating the key points from both texts. Use your own words throughout as much as possible, and include your own ideas in your answer'\nteacher: Yes! the ideas from the two texts\nstudent: Right. Ok\nstudent: I have to go now. Thanks again Ms. Rodriguez!\nteacher: Yes, it's all about answering the exact question they are asking (the content mark)\nteacher: Ok, sure! Talk to you next week!\nstudent: See you!!",
    "teacher: Hi Emily Johnson!\nstudent: Hi\nteacher: How are you? We haven't spoken for ages, and now you're on holiday!\nstudent: I'm fine\nstudent: I\u2019m *\nstudent: holiday is\nstudent: p\nstudent: Oh my god\nteacher: :)) it's ok, take your time\nstudent: my tablet is crazy today\nstudent: wait a second\nteacher: sure\nstudent: okay I am ready\nstudent: so\nstudent: my holiday is a bit strange\nstudent: sometimes it is lazy and not interesting but sometimes it is exciting!\nstudent: for example\nstudent: I wake up at 11-12\nstudent: and I do nothing for hours\nstudent: then I go out with somebody\nstudent: it's not easy to have new ideas about what to do\nstudent: for example yesterday I didn\u2019t know what to do\nteacher: Are you back in Kyiv then?\nstudent: then my friend called me and said that she had sat her ZNO and the school where she sat it wasn't far from my house\nstudent: yes, I\u2019m back in Kyiv\nteacher: I see! Sounds like you've got plenty of time on your hands - nice!\nteacher: Are you going to do any summer classes  or maybe go to a summer camp? Or maybe visit your family again?\nstudent: then I called another friend and we also went out\nstudent: I thought it would be another boring day\nstudent: I go to an exam booster from Linguaviva Academy\nteacher: Oh interesting! Which exam are you preparing for?\nstudent: We can\u2019t visit our family because Israel doesn\u2019t let anybody in from Ukraine\nstudent: I\u2019m not preparing for anything\nstudent: just for the future\nstudent: now I know some more tricks for Listening\nteacher: Oh shame! You haven't seen your family in Israel for a long time now, have you?\nstudent: we are studying an IELTS book\nteacher: Ah, interesting!\nstudent: no, I haven\u2019t\nteacher: IELTS, ok, I see!\nstudent: from 2019\nteacher: The IELTS certificate is only valid for 2 years as you probably know, so yes, it only makes sense to take IELTS when you need it!\nstudent: so now I know that Listening in IELTS and the whole IELTS test is evil\nteacher: Haha, well, there is a reason for it\nstudent: at the end of our course (25 of June) we will have a trial test\nteacher: IELTS is a multilevel test. People who are only beginners and people who are fluent take the same test\nteacher: However, there are lots of level tests that Cambridge has developed. The one that will be good for you to prepare for if you're interested is B2\nstudent: yeah, I think our book is intermediate or intermediate plus\nteacher: Yes, I think the B2 test should be the right level of challenge for you\nteacher: Sorry, it's B2 First (it used to be called FCE)\nteacher: Here's a link if you're curious\nteacher: Unlike IELTS, a B2 First certificate is forever (it doesn't expire)\nstudent: the link doesn\u2019t work\nteacher: Ah, it doesn't work in this chatroom, sorry! You can just search for 'Cambridge B2 First' using your search engine\nstudent: yeah I checked the website\nstudent: are you here?\nteacher: Sure. How did it go with the final test, by the way?\nstudent: oh it\u2019s okay!\nteacher: Was it ok?\nstudent: 0.835\nstudent: or 117/140\nteacher: Ooh, that's really good, well done!\nstudent: thanks\nteacher: So... As I mentioned, this is our final class! Is there anything you would like to talk about? Exams? Tips on how to work on your English in the future? Books? Anything else?\nteacher: Maybe you've got a burning grammar question you've been dying to ask me this whole time?\nstudent: oh, maybe we can talk about tips on how to work on my English in the future)\nteacher: Absolutely!\nstudent: I just understand now that I will miss so much :(\nstudent: *how\nstudent: oh my god\nteacher: Aww, I will miss you too! It will be weird, we've been talking for a year now! You always have my Skype if you'd like to message me, right?\nstudent: of course\nstudent: do you have any plans for the summer?\nteacher: Soo... I understand that your goal is to learn 'all English' and be able to communicate fluently. That's the general goal. But right now, what would you like to be able to do in English? Talk to people? Watch movies? Listen to songs and understand lyrics? Chat to other Roblox players from other countries?\nteacher: I do, yes! We're working (and my son is at school) until the end of July, and then we're going on holiday (yaaaay!) to Cornwall. It's a beautiful (and warm!) place in England, in the south-west\nteacher: In the meantime, I'm enjoying the beautiful English summer and especially my garden :)\nstudent: well, for me it is important to understand what I listen to or what I read, even if I don\u2019t know the word, I can understand it from context. By the way, I want to know more about the difference between different English countries\nstudent: Is Cornwall a city?\nstudent: Wow, you will have only one month of holiday! Why?\nteacher: Cornwall is a county. Do you remember, at the very beginning we were talking about the UK being divided into counties? it's like 'oblast'\nstudent: oh yeah\nteacher: Schoolchildren in this country only get 6 weeks of summer holidays, yes!\nteacher: If you imagine the map of the UK, Cornwall is in the bottom left corner :)\nstudent: that\u2019s sad\ud83d\ude22\nstudent: oh, makes sense\nteacher: Yes, it's unusual for us, isn\nteacher: isn't it\nteacher: But at least it gives parents a chance to work. Not many people would be able to take 3 months off to spend with the kids!\nteacher: Back to the UK. It's made up of 4 countries. England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. They are all very different and have their local governments. But of course, there's a general UK government and parliament in London\nteacher: But you probably know that, right?\nstudent: yes!\nstudent: at least I know it from the texts from English books, not from geography lessons!\nteacher: Yes, sure, it should be in your English texts!\nteacher: Ok, to go back to understanding what you hear and what you read in English!\nteacher: The key to understanding is words. I really believe there's no way round it, to learn a language you need to learn lots of new words (and I also think this is the fun part, too!)\nteacher: I really recommend a good dictionary. Lots of people use online translations, but a good English-English dictionary that explains instead of translating can do so much more!\nteacher: I always recommend Cambridge English dictionary online. You can listen to the pronunciation there too and there are pictures and quizzes!\nstudent: Yes , I know that translating words is not as good as understanding them, for example when you speak you remember the translation, not the word\nteacher: Exactly!\nteacher: And then just use your favourite way to memorize words, maybe an app or a notebook or post-it notes\nteacher: How do you prefer to learn new words?\nstudent: I tried using an app for studying words but it was boring\nteacher: Ok, sure. Just a notebook always worked for me, especially a small one that I could carry with me everywhere\nstudent: if I need to study them I just repeat them a lot of times and if I don\u2019t know the meaning I google it\nstudent: also I have a vocabulary notebook, I've been writing words there since the fifth form\nteacher: Sounds perfect!\nstudent: but it is for school, so there are not definitions, just translations\nteacher: In terms of listening, the trick to understanding is actually pronunciation! Once you start to understand how English pronunciation works, you can understand so much more when you hear it!\nteacher: Sure, you can always create a new one just for yourself, right?\nstudent: yes\nteacher: We haven't been able to do much pronunciation work here, obviously :)\nteacher: But! There's a really nice series on the BBC Learning English website\nteacher: It's called Tim's Pronunciation Workshop\nteacher: It's really useful (and funny too!) and teaches you how to understand when people speak fast and don't pronounce every word very carefully\nstudent: I will also check it later\nstudent: I found the website\nteacher: You can just find it through your search engine because links don't work as we know\nteacher: Perfect! There's lots of fun stuff to do there, too!\nteacher: And of course, if you'd like a project, I always recommend reading in English (and learning those new words), and our favourites, the HP books are perfect for this\nteacher: The first two books are written for younger readers as you know, and the language is not as difficult. By the time you get to the third book, you've already got some experience reading in English and it's easier for you anyway!\nteacher: The way I used to approach reading in English was to learn every single new word at first! It's hard work at first and you can only read a few pages at a time, but then, after a few chapters it becomes so much easier! There are usually very few new words by the end of the book\nstudent: I think I will try\nstudent: maybe not the whole book\nstudent: something not long\nteacher: Yes, you can take it slowly at first and then see how it goes!\nstudent: I think somebody gave me an English book\nstudent: as a gift\nteacher: Obviously, if there's a blog / Insta / tik tok account that you like in English, that could be perfect for smaller texts\nstudent: I probably like watching tiktok videos on English\nstudent: for example I watch anime\nteacher: Oh yes, I think you mentioned it before!\nstudent: and there is a Russian side of it\nstudent: and there is an English side\nteacher: Oh, like a comic?\nstudent: no, just some videos in tiktok\nteacher: Ah sure!\nstudent: you see, if you watch anything (anime, series, film etc.) you can see some different fandom videos on tiktok\nteacher: Ok, Emily Johnson, I've got to let you go now! Thank you for participating in this project and helping science! It's been a pleasure to talk to you and teach you :)\nstudent: fandom means fans of something\nteacher: Aah, I didn't know that! about fandom videos. I don't know much about tiktok I'm afraid!\nstudent: thank you so much too! It was really fun and interesting to participate! Thank you so much for everything you\u2019ve done for me! I am going to miss you so much! I think we will chat in Skype!\nteacher: I'm going to miss you to! Take care, have a wonderful summer, write on Skype! :))\nstudent: Anyway,goodbye! Have a good day and summer!\nteacher: *too\nteacher: Thank you Emily Johnson, you too! Bye :)",
    "student: Hi Mrs. Thompson!\nteacher: Hi Hannah!\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: Good, thank you! How about you?\nteacher: All good, thank you!\nteacher: Thanks for your essay, I really enjoyed reading it! Some very nice language there :)\nteacher: I especially liked the inverted third conditional :)\nteacher: Had it not been for this shared trove of knowledge and rules, it would have been impossible to build today\u2019s nations where millions of people, who are de facto strangers to each other, live and thrive together.\nteacher: I mean this one\nteacher: Also, it's an elegant summary of the two viewpoints, very nice\nstudent: Thank you :) As I explained it took me a while to write it, but I thought that sometimes trying to perfect one's language can be a good exercise :)\nteacher: Yes, absolutely. If you were in a situation where you have to observe the time limit such as an exam, I'd suggest sticking to a very clear structure with topic sentences, It does speed up the process! (I would say the structure is very clear in the last two paragraphs, but the beginning is more free-flowing)\nstudent: Maybe I should start by writing a topic sentence for each paragraph ;) It took me a long time to write it for multiple reasons, among them the fact that I rewrote some parts...\nstudent: *some parts\nteacher: Yes, a boring but reliable structure. 1. Introduction (signposting early what you're going to write about) 2. topic sentence, expansion 3. topic sentence, expansion\nteacher: or maybe 4 too, I'm not saying there should be 3 paragraphs :)\nstudent: Yes, of course :) The problem is that it is difficult to be 'creative' with such a structure...\nstudent: since it is a topic that I'm interested in I had plenty to write about in 'my way'...but, of course, for an exam it's better to choose some topics\nstudent: and produce just what you're asked for :)\nteacher: Yes! But it's also difficult to steer away from the topic and get lost, which is a problem with a lot of exam writing (not yours, actually)\nteacher: Yep, that's the trick!\nteacher: It is an interesting topic though, isn't it? And the one that's existed since the dawn of time as your video so nicely illustrates :)\nstudent: Yes, it is quite interesting, especially as a parent...and I think that it is becoming more and more apparent, as society changes at a greater speed...\nteacher: Yes, I'm sure our kids' generation will find ways to shock us even though we might be thinking now that we've seen it all\nstudent: If I think about the first time I surfed the internet, I was one of the first in my little town...and now, if we have a problem, that's 'too much' internet...\nstudent: Haha, indeed...we'll have to wait and see what they come up with\nteacher: Anyway, for our final lesson, have you maybe got any questions / anything you'd like to discuss / anything I can help with?\nstudent: Hmm...no, not really...\nstudent: As I told you I've bought the book you sent me via pdf, and I plan on working on it from start to finish\nteacher: Oh really? I must have missed it somehow! The orange one?\nstudent: Yes, from Longman :)\nteacher: I see, oh it's really good, I'm sure you'll enjoy it!\nstudent: But then, if you have some exercises or interesting sayings with difficult vocabulary, that would be fine for me :)\nstudent: Yes, I like how it is structured! And it is packed with exercises...\nteacher: Yes, I do have something prepared, we'll get to it in a second, just wanted to check with you first\nteacher: You probably do it anyway, but I do recommend reading good quality media in English, I do believe it helps with the language a lot!\nteacher: I know I've become a better writer because I do like my Guardian articles :)\nteacher: What do you prefer to read in English?\nstudent: I read mostly books...from biographies to science and technology related treaties...\nstudent: Sometimes I skim through bbc or cnn, but I find it hard to read attentively a whole article on my mobile phone...\nstudent: Oh, I also read a lot of scientific articles on machine learning, but the quality of the language there is mixed...\nteacher: Right, sure, the quality of the language is not the main point there I can imagine\nteacher: I think an opinion article is as close as it gets 'in real life' to those exam essays, and they're usually full of good language\nstudent: It should be of some concern...but currently the pace at which articles in ML (machine learning) appear is out of control...which leads to lower quality in many aspects (including language)\nstudent: Indeed...they also have the advantage of being 'short': I am used to long texts, but in real life you often need to be synthetic\nteacher: Interesting! You're in a very dynamic field\nteacher: Yes, absolutely, they are quite concise and pack a lot in a small space\nteacher: Anyway, a little something I've prepared for you to practice those past conditionals (if you have the book handy, feel free to open this chapter, the one we were working on last time)\nteacher: I'm going to tell you a story and invite you to speculate about what could have happened if people had acted differently :)\nstudent: I would dare to say that, to a point, it is a fad...a lot of people have been blinded by the promises of artificial intelligence, money is flowing and people are trying to apply it to everything...still it is very interesting and dynamic, indeed!\nstudent: Okay! I have the book here, but I don't remember the page...\nteacher: One second, I'll find it\nteacher: A fad? Very interesting, coming from you! As I said before, my main objection from the user side of it is 'artificial empathy'. It just doesn't work in my opinion!\nteacher: It's page 88 in the actual book and page 89 in the pdf\nteacher: Ok, the story!\nstudent: Haha...not in all aspects, but in some, for instance empathy...or creating an artificial psychiatrist ;) Yes, the story!\nstudent: Are you still here?\nteacher: It's about a poor musician called Anton who lived in a small fishing village. He and the daughter of a rich fisherman, Barbara, were in love, and he went to her father to ask for her hand. The father said that he had to have a boat to be able to marry his daughter and provide for her. But Anton did not have a boat, only his guitar! Anton went to his friend Chris, a fisherman, and asked to borrow his boat. But Chris refused him saying that he needed the boat for work. Barbara and Anton broked up. Heartbroken, Anton proposed to another girl, Elizabeth, but Elizabeth said he was still in love with Barbara and turned him down. Anton was unhappy and unmarried then. But who was to blame?\nteacher: Sorry, still here, but a long story!\nteacher: in third conditional sentences, please :)\nstudent: If Anton had had a boat he would have been able to support a family and Barbara's father would have granted her hand.\nteacher: *broke up, not broked!\nteacher: Nearly! If Anton ___ ___ a boat,\nstudent: had had?\nteacher: Yes!\nteacher: Or Barbara's father should have been more open-minded?\nstudent: If Chris hadn't needed the boat for work, he would have lent it to Anton.\nteacher: My guess is that in Italian 'borrow' and 'lend' are the same verb :) he would have lent it to Anton!\nstudent: If Barbara's father had grown up in another time he would have been more open-minded and let Barbara choose who to marry.\nteacher: Nearly! had ___ up in another time\nstudent: They are indeed, but to be fair I was a bit dubious about which verb to use...\nstudent: grown\nteacher: lend (lent, lent) = let someone temporarily have something that belongs to you\nteacher: borrow: borrow some money from a bank, borrow a book from the library, May I borrow your pen, please?\nteacher: And which of them is a synonym of 'loan'?\nstudent: I see :) The difference is between the fact that you are actively 'giving' something or 'taking' something...\nstudent: A loan is something you ask a bank for, so I'd go for 'borrow'...\nstudent: But I didn't know loan was a verb too\nteacher: Yes! Like in Italian, it's the same verb in my native language, so I could recognize the problem :) But there's a very clear distinction in English. Also, you don't use 'have' instead of 'borrow'\nteacher: There's a big difference between 'you can have it' and 'you can borrow it'!\nteacher: If you say 'you can have it', you don't expect 'it' back!\nstudent: That's quite clear to me\nteacher: Ok, sure!\nteacher: to take out a loan / apply for a bank loan means to borrow money from a bank or to try to do so\nstudent: Haha I know :) Unless you say something like 'you can have it for a couple of days, but I need it this Sunday'\nteacher: But 'to loan' means 'to lend'\nstudent: (I hope I'm not making up an expression) Oh...okay\nteacher: Banks loan money\nteacher: Yes, exactly, it would be clearer to say 'you can borrow it for a couple of days!'\nstudent: So my reasoning was wrong...ok...I guess it is more formal\nstudent: I mean loan is used in more formal situations, right?\nteacher: Ooh, we're out of time!\nstudent: Or maybe with money/institutions?\nteacher: Yes, absolutely!\nstudent: 13:59 on my laptop\nteacher: Loan is more formal!\nteacher: Right, thank you very much for participating in this project! It's been a pleasure to chat with you over the last few months :)\nteacher: You've still got my email address if you'd like to contact me one day, I'll be very happy to hear from you!\nstudent: Thank you! It was a pleasure for me too! And also a great opportunity for me, and science :)\nstudent: Of course! You have my e-mail too, for instance if you ever need some suggestions about what to visit in Italy ;)\nstudent: Thank you again! And have a great summer! Bye, bye!\nteacher: Oh that would be so nice, I hope we can go next year! I'll definitely turn to you for suggestions\nteacher: Thank you, and all the best to you and your family! Bye Hannah!",
    "student: Hello!\nstudent: Sorry for being late\nstudent: I really needed to have my lunch. I was starving)))\nteacher: Hi Emily!\nteacher: No worries, totally understand :)\nteacher: What did you have?\nstudent: I've had a schnitzel with some nut salad and fries\nteacher: Oh goodness, it sounds so nice! I haven't had a schnitzel for ages\nstudent: It was extraordinary. I have finally found the perfect Glovo restaurant\nteacher: glovo?\nstudent: Glovo is a delivery service. Like Uber Eats\nteacher: Aah, I see!\nstudent: There are plenty of restaurants to choose from\nteacher: Sounds great!\nstudent: Having tried quite a few, I've finally managed to find a good one with great lunch options\nteacher: When we finally go to Ukraine, I'll be asking you for some tips :)\nstudent: Sure! I just wanted to write that I'll give you \u044f\u0432\u043a\u0438 \u0438 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u043e\u043b\u0438 once you arrive\nstudent: Dunno how to say this in English))\nteacher: Haha, yes please! Well, the names...  I don't think there's an idiom. At least I can't think of one\nteacher: What's the covid situation like at the moment? Infections are going up again here :(\nstudent: 1188 cases in the past 24 hours\nstudent: I guess the stats are good\nteacher: In Kyiv? or in Ukraine?\nstudent: is good?\nstudent: in Ukraine\nstudent: in Kyiv -- 251\nteacher: statistics = plural noun\nstudent: Thanks\nteacher: Oh, that's good! It's around 9000 in the UK, sadly\nteacher: mainly among younger people who haven't got the protection of two vaccines yet\nstudent: what about other nouns like this. For example, logistics?\nstudent: Sad(\nstudent: Ours might be higher of course\nstudent: Who knows how they make up the stats\nteacher: logistics is plural too!\nstudent: mathematics too?\nteacher: Yes, sure, depends on how accessible the testing is and how it's all accounted for as you say\nteacher: Actually no, mathematics is uncountable\nstudent: Now you can easily get vaccinated here. All the elderly have been vaccinated\nstudent: Hmm, so apparently there's no single rule for nouns ending in -ics\nteacher: Oh, that's brilliant!\nstudent: How has your vaccination been?\nstudent: Did you feel anything odd?\nteacher: Yes, like economics etc.\nstudent: Right. Thank you!\nteacher: The main side effect was pain in my arm! and maybe tiredness, but nothing major\nteacher: I'm still waiting to be invited for the second dose, it'll probably be a couple of months now\nstudent: Great! It's good that you took it lightly (if I can put it like that)))\nteacher: Yes, indeed, thank you! David felt quite ill after his, actually (but it was a different vaccine)\nteacher: You will probably be fine if you decide to get a jab because you should still have antibodies, right? I think that's the logic\nstudent: Oh really. Which one was it?\nteacher: He had the AstraZeneca one and I had the Pfizer\nstudent: I didn't know that. However, I think if I still have any antibodies there are like 5 of them left\nstudent: ))))))\nteacher: 5 tiny antibodies!))))\nstudent: Exactly!\nteacher: :)))\nstudent: So what do you plan to do with all the time free from the Cambridge experiment?\nteacher: Ok, what shall we do for our last class? a bit of grammar and vocabulary from the book? revisiting writing? anything else?\nstudent: Maybe let's just talk? =)\nteacher: Well, I'm still working until the beginning of August, then Ethan will be on holiday, then, in September, I'll have a baby! That's the plan :)\nteacher: We can just talk if you promise to ask me grammar / vocabulary questions every now and then :) we need our teaching points for the chat!\nstudent: WOWWWW Amazing news! Congratulations!\nteacher: Thank you :))) we're full of joyful anticipation :)\nstudent: This makes me so happy!\nteacher: Aww, thank you!\nteacher: We're actually going to pick up a pram tonight. Do you know the difference between a pram and a pushchair?\nstudent: Do you know the gender? Or you want a surprise?\nstudent: A pushchair is for older babies?\nteacher: No surprises, please! It's a little boy :)\nstudent: YAY!!\nteacher: Ethan's delighted because girls are lame, apparently\nteacher: if you're 5\nstudent: Thank you for sharing. It has really lifted my spirits\nstudent: ahahaha\nstudent: I think boys think like this right until puberty hits\nstudent: haahaha\nteacher: Yes, pretty much I think!\nteacher: Yes, a pram is short for a perambulator (such a charming word) and is horizontal\nteacher: I mean the baby lies horizontally in them\nteacher: And a pushchair is like a chair that can be pushed :))\nstudent: A charming word indeed))))\nteacher: Yes, I'm just thinking of other words for baby / child gear that might be of interest to you. Although you probably know them all...\nstudent: Actually, not many. What is the word for \u043f\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0438\u043a?\nteacher: That's a good one! A changing table\nteacher: Because you change a nappy / diaper, but colloquially, you change the baby :)\nteacher: Even though we wouldn't change our babies for the world! :)\nteacher: or better probably, get the baby changed\nteacher: What do you call a chair where a baby / toddler is secured and elevated and where you feed them?\nstudent: And a high chair is that feeding table, right?\nteacher: Yep, a high chair :)\nstudent: And the bed is called a cradle?\nstudent: cradle\nteacher: Hmm, a cot, more often\nstudent: A cot. Right\nteacher: There's an American word for it, I'm trying to remember\nteacher: a crib!\nteacher: a crib AmE = a cot BrE\nstudent: I just remembered that song, you know. Rockabye baby\nstudent: There's a word 'cradle' in it\nteacher: I think a cradle is a smaller cot that can swing\nstudent: Oh, I see.\nteacher: also a Moses basket (for newborns)\nstudent: And what do you call a \u0431\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043b?\nstudent: Got it\nteacher: Hmm, I'm not sure what it is!\nteacher: I'll google some pictures\nteacher: Haha, I've been wondering what the Russian for this was!\nteacher: a balance bike!\nteacher: ___ do you call it?\nstudent: What))\nstudent: Sorry\nstudent: a balance bike!\nstudent: cool\nstudent: \u0411\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043b is funny\nteacher: Can Sophia ride a balance bike?\nteacher: I know, I had images of crosstrainers in my head :))\nteacher: Oops, did I misspell her name again?\nteacher: And what do you call an enclosed playspace for a child? like \u043c\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0436\nstudent: She only rides the scooter\nstudent: No, all correct!\nteacher: Ooh, very cool!\nteacher: Phew! I've been in doubt\nstudent: \u043c\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0436 - don't know\nteacher: a playpen\nstudent: haha interesting\nstudent: why -pen though?\nteacher: I think it comes from a pen where animals are kept\nteacher: a sheep pen, a pig pen\nteacher: like an area with a fence around it, but open air\nstudent: Oh yes, children can act like animals\nstudent: Makes sense))\nteacher: herd them into playpens :))\nteacher: Ok, on this unethical note, I've got to thank you for your wonderful contribution to this research project :) And it's been such a pleasure to talk to you here, thank you very much!\nstudent: Thank you very very much for everything, Mrs. Patel.!\nstudent: I learnt a lot.\nstudent: Still need to work on my essay writing skills and low self-esteem though, haha\nstudent: I really hope to see you soon and stay in touch\nteacher: You're very welcome! I'm so glad it's been of value to you! And let's keep in touch in the future!\nteacher: Yes, your English is brilliant, it's time to go out an shine! :)\nstudent: Sure! I'll be happy to meet you in Kyiv and treat you to a cup of tea or matcha latte))\nstudent: Thank you! It means a lot!\nteacher: Ooh, yes, only hipster stuff for me in Kyiv, no tea! :))\nstudent: Will do!\nstudent: Take care and all the best to you!!!\nteacher: :)) All the best, thank you and good bye!\nteacher: Thank you :)\nstudent: Good bye! (*love emoji*)\nteacher: Love emoji back! bye Emily! :)\nstudent: bye bye",
    "student: Hi Mrs. Rodriguez!\nstudent: Sorry for being late\nteacher: Hello!\nteacher: No worries at all!\nteacher: How are you?\nstudent: Fine\nstudent: thank you\nstudent: and you?\nteacher: Good, thank you! It's absolutely pouring here!\nstudent: pouring? )\nteacher: How's Sophia been settling at the nursery this week?\nteacher: Yes, raining very hard! You know, like pour some water into a glass\nstudent: Ah! Wow\nstudent: It's hot here\nteacher: I guess 'pouring down' is more correct, actually\nstudent: I saw on Instagram that it was raining in Kyiv yesterday, but I didn't 'meet' the rain )\nteacher: It was hot until yesterday, now it's been raining non-stop :)\nteacher: Oh, interesting! Kyiv is big I guess!\nstudent: Sophia is ok, but she decides till which time to be at the nursery each day\nstudent: and it is not very convenient for me ))\nteacher: That's nice! What has she decided today?\nteacher: Oh, I see!\nstudent: But I negotiated with her about next Tuesday so I'm happy about it )\nstudent: Today she asked to pick her up from the nursery at 3 pm\nstudent: So it's quite good\nteacher: Yes, you'll have a little bit of time. And then her nanny will be back soon!\nstudent: because on Monday she asked to do it at 12:30 and I really didn't have time for work\nstudent: just 3 hours\nstudent: Yeah\nteacher: Speaking of work, I've noticed that SymbioTech Solutions.'s launched some new courses!\nstudent: but we are going on holiday, so we will be with the nanny just 1 working day ))\nteacher: You're going on holiday? Exciting!! Where?\nstudent: It's near Chernomorsk city\nstudent: About 1 hour from Odessa\nstudent: But the sea is better because the beach is not so close to the city\nteacher: Yes, I can imagine!\nstudent: It is called Serenity Shores Resort )\nteacher: Ooh, you're going on a beach holiday, yay!\nstudent: They have several buildings with bedrooms and kitchens\nteacher: I can't wait for our holiday too, we're going to Cornwall\nstudent: And an open space with playgrounds for children\nteacher: Sounds perfect!\nstudent: with washing machines\nstudent: etc.\nstudent: Cornwall! Hm\nstudent: I think I've heard about it before\nteacher: It sounds like your holiday is 'self-catering', is that right? When you buy and cook the food yourselves, and do the washing etc.\nstudent: is it a popular place?\nteacher: Yes, it's going to be especially popular this summer now that many people can't go on holiday abroad\nstudent: It could be self-catering, but also we can order food there and they will cook it for us\nstudent: But we are going to go with my mom and Sophia, and one week later Sophia and Ethan will join us\nteacher: It's the very south-east of England. It's warmer and the sea is beautiful!\nstudent: So I think it will be ok to cook \u043f\u043e \u043e\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438 ) or together )\nteacher: Ok, you're going to take turns cooking. Fair enough!\nstudent: wow! It sounds perfect. When are you going there?\nstudent: yes! To take turns )\nteacher: Once Emily's finished school, the last week of July\nteacher: Sorry, it's not the south-east of England! It's the south-west!\nstudent: Oh! They also have fridges with ice-cream, vareniky and pelmeny, so we can buy and eat this food )\nteacher: Oh, you're sorted then :))) ice-cream, vareniky and pelmeny, what else do you need? )))\nteacher: I bet in Cornwall there are going to be a lot of Cornish pasties and Cornish ice-cream, and fish and chips\nteacher: Do you know Cornish pasties?\nstudent: \u0440\u0444\u0440\u0444\nstudent: sorry )\nteacher: They are medium-sized pies filled with some meat, carrots and peas\nstudent: haha, you are right! )\nstudent: Ok\nstudent: I don't know Cornish pasties\nstudent: Let me check please )\nteacher: It's very simple food\nstudent: Ah! \u041f\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0436\u043a\u0438 )))))\nstudent: It looks very tasty )\nteacher: Yes, well, they are bigger than pirozhki and the pastry is different\nstudent: I see )\nteacher: But it's the same idea of putting some filling in pastry so that it's easy to eat on the go or at work if you're a miner or a sailor\nstudent: miner? )\nteacher: Yes, someone who works down the mine. A coal mine for example, where people cut coal out of rock, or a salt mine\nteacher: or a gold mine, if you're lucky :)\nstudent: ah!\nstudent: Coal\nteacher: Yes, like in Donbass (at least there used to be mines...)\nstudent: I see now\nstudent: thank you\nstudent: It's strange but I didn't know the word before\nteacher: No worries! There used to be a lot of mines in the UK, but then the country started importing a lot of its fuel. And now, obviously, everyone is trying to find alternative sources of energy and stop mining!\nstudent: ah!\nteacher: No problem, that's what we're here for :)\nstudent: But I know the word mining )\nstudent: bitcoin mining )\nteacher: Haha, there you go! I'm not sure what it means but still!\nstudent: haha )\nteacher: Well, I understand 'bitcoin' and 'mining', but not together))\nstudent: Bitcoin mining is the process by which new bitcoins are entered into circulation, but it is also a critical component of the maintenance and development of the blockchain ledger. It is performed using very sophisticated computers that solve extremely complex computational math problems.\nstudent: it's not my text )))))\nteacher: Right, I'll have to look it up later, I can't say it's very clear to me :)))\nstudent: me neither )))))\nteacher: So, when you're on holiday, you can make food yourselves, or you can have something made for you, right?\nteacher: Remember we talked about 'have something V3'? to mean that someone else does it for you\nstudent: Aha, I remember\nteacher: Great! Shall we practice a bit? I'll give you a sentence where the person does something themselves and you change it into 'have something done', ok?\nteacher: e.g. I clean my windows ever month. I have my windows cleaned every month\nstudent: I see\nstudent: let's do it )\nteacher: One second, I lost my exercise!\nstudent: no probs\nstudent: )\nteacher: Here it is!\nteacher: Mind that tenses are different in different sentences\nstudent: ok!\nteacher: They are painting portraits of their children.\nstudent: They are having?\nstudent: their children's portraits painted\nteacher: Yes, absolutely!\nstudent: super )\nteacher: Have you done your hair?
