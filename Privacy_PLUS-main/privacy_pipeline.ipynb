      "teacher: Sure - a lot of it is crowd control - some people are good at it - it's like a vocation I guess. I do really admire those teachers - that's why I don't consider myself a really great teacher to be honest!  Yes there are more young people overall - \u001b[6;30;42m[definitely]\u001b[0m in my school too!\n",

I'll think of some more stuff to challenge you! In the meantime, I thought I'd revisit a bit of vocabulary you did in the lesson at Studio \u001b[6;30;42m[the other day]\u001b[0m ok? give me a second\n",
      "student: What does 'flying colours' mean?\n",
      "teacher: Do you remember the lesson you did with the folowing adjectives? e.g. relieved/confused/optimistic/annoyed etc? Could you give me a setence (true if possible) to describe a time you expereinced any of these feelings I just mentioned in the list?\n",
      "teacher: Oh sorry - in this context it means you passed to a high standard\n",
      "teacher: you got a high mark basically\n",

      "student: I was really relieved to hear my husband say my cooking was delicious.\n",

      "teacher: \u001b[6;30;42m[THat]\u001b[0m's OK - do you know the word 'nautical'? as in related to the sailing - there are loads of phrases related to this area in English\n",
      "student: Oh, I didn't know that word. Maybe that's because the \u001b[6;30;42m[UK]\u001b[0m is an island country.\n",
      "student: Sorry, my next example...\n",
      "student: I was confused when I heard about my grandmother's death.\n",
      "student: I didn't use to be optimistic when I was a student.\n",
      "teacher: Yeah - and remember it has a very strong naval tradition - that's what kept \u001b[6;30;42m[the BRitish Empire]\u001b[0m going for so long! I'll get some examples for our next lesson of common phrases derived from this. OK thanks for your confused example - sorry if it's a sad subject ...but this suggests you didn't understand \u001b[6;30;42m[something....is]\u001b[0m that true for your example?\n",
      "student: Yes, unfortunately it's true and I went back to \u001b[6;30;42m[Japan]\u001b[0m \u001b[6;30;42m[two weeks ago]\u001b[0m because of this. I was so confused because she had been absolutely fine until \u001b[6;30;42m[that day]\u001b[0m.\n",
      "teacher: OK thanks I understand. I think maybe 'shocked' is better here.\n",
      "teacher: \u001b[6;30;42m[Emily]\u001b[0m, can you give me the missing two words in the following: I’m optimistic _______ my chances of winning. I was confused ______ the explanation.\n",
      "student: I'm optimistic for... and I was confused with...?\n",
      "student: Ah, I understood that 'shocked' is better.\n",
      "teacher: OK thanks - we normally say 'optimistic about' and 'confused by'. Can you try to think of two more examples using these structures correctly (true if possible!)\n",
      "student: Oh, it's difficult! I was annoyed by the cancellation of my train.\n",

      "student: About for 1, and by for 2, right?\n",
      "teacher: Yes that's it good! You can kind of see the similarity with the adjective groups - though it's not exactly a rule!\n",
      "teacher: Could you try a sentence with: impressed and bored\n",
      "student: I think group 1 is more emotional... is that right?\n",
      "student: I was impressed by her works.\n",
      "student: I was bored with his story.\n",
      "teacher: Yeah I guess that's \u001b[6;30;42m[true...al]\u001b[0mso, it's more like a reaction to a general situation and the others are often assciated with a smaller, more contained event\n",
      "teacher: sorry not a great explanation but you get the idea?!\n",
      "student: Hmm... I have to get used to it!\n",
      "teacher: THanks - 'impressed by' or 'with' is good. 'bored of' is possible and peopel say it in real life though some more careful speakers prefer 'bored with' = more 'correct'\n",
      "student: Thank you. I understood.\n",
      "teacher: I'll think again about my explanation before and improve it for next time with examples!\n",
      "student: Thank you. Is there any rule??\n",
      "student: Sorry, 'rules'\n",
      "teacher: One last task on this topic \u001b[6;30;42m[Emily]\u001b[0m: could you tell me a time you were: suspicious/curious By the way, sorry no rule! Adjectives + prepositions is a bit unpredictable I'm afraid...\n",
      "teacher: Rule inthe singular was OK because you can think of all adjectives together in one group\n",
      "student: I see. Thank you.\n",
      "teacher: e.g. you can imagine one rule covering everything or many rules\n",
      "student: I was suspicious of his story.\n",
      "student: I am curious about the group activity.\n",
      "teacher: \u001b[6;30;42m[THanks Emily - ']\u001b[0msuspicious of' is much more common but 'about' is OK too! curious about is good...\n",
      "student: Wow.. there are many kinds of preposition!\n",
      "teacher: Yeah sorry - keep using them and it will become automatic - Do you know the nouns? Take a quick look back and write the nouns of any of the adjectives you've done...\n",
      "teacher: 4 or 5 if you like\n",
      "student: Do you mean like 'curiosity?'\n",
      "teacher: Exactly\n",
      "student: impression, relief, confusion,excitement\n",
      "teacher: Thanks - could you choose two of those and give me an example?\n",
      "student: The film made an impression on me.\n",
      "teacher: Thanks Emily - do you mean : I was impressed by the film?\n",
      "student: Yes. Is that correct?\n",
      "teacher: Sorry I mean Emily - unfortunate error!\n",
      "teacher: You need to say: the film made an impression on me\n",
      "student: Make an impression.... and this time I need 'on'\n",
      "student: Thank you for telling me.\n",
      "teacher: If you use the adjective form it's more normal to mean it in a straight-forward positive sense whereas the noun phrase is slightly more ambiguous (probably basically positive though)\n",
      "student: The accident caused traffic chaos.\n",
      "teacher: Thanks - the noun confusion goes with e.g. cause so for example: the mistake caused a great deal of confusion - for traffic we'd say something like 'chaos' maybe as in the accident caused (that verb again - or led to etc) traffic chaos\n",
      "teacher: Could you try relief or excitement? I thin k this is useful...\n",
      "student: The result of an exam was a relief to me.\n",
      "teacher: \u001b[6;30;42m[THanks Emily - yes]\u001b[0m, good example and you can say a relief \u001b[6;30;42m[FOR...it]\u001b[0m's common to say: it was relief to me. Also the phrase is quite common: it came as a relief to me\n",
      "teacher: which is maybe less familiar to you (again, with 'familiar' you could say 'for' but 'to' is more normal\n",
      "teacher: much more normal\n",
      "teacher: Last question \u001b[6;30;42m[Emily]\u001b[0m - do you know 'relieve' as a verb? Culd you give me an example of that?!\n",

      "teacher: THanks - a logical example...but (!) ...have you seen for example adverts for painkillers? They always say 'fast,efffective pain relief' \u001b[6;30;42m[...so]\u001b[0m...what can you releive\n",
      "teacher: I mean relieve\n",
      "student: I can relieve pain?\n",
      "teacher: That's it! It nearly always goes with e.g. relieve pain/worry/traffic congestion (!) - stuff like that\n",
      "teacher: OK \u001b[6;30;42m[Emily]\u001b[0m thanks for \u001b[6;30;42m[today]\u001b[0m - did you prefer the lesson \u001b[6;30;42m[today]\u001b[0m? Would you like more of the same?\n",

      "student: I continue\n",

      "teacher: and on your first day you said - you mean of driving or of your job?\n",
      "student: The funny thing was that they rang their insurance company earlier than me and made up a story\n",
      "student: They said that it was my fault so I had to fix my car and pay for it. I learnt the lesson ;)\n",
      "teacher: Oh no! I guess you can never tell what people are going to do...\n",
      "teacher: Thanks \u001b[6;30;42m[Emily -  ]\u001b[0mYes we say ‘on the road’ to talk in general – ‘in’ the road is like a specific place in space do you see?  So for example do we say sleep ‘in’ or ‘on’ the street for rough sleepers do you think?\n",
      "student: I don't really understand your question '-you mean of driving or of your job?'\n",
      "student: It was my first day at work \u001b[6;30;42m[10 years ago]\u001b[0m\n",

      "student: OK thank you!\n",
      "student: About on or in the road\n",
      "student: I would say that they sleep on the street\n",
      "student: Is it correct?\n",
      "teacher: Yes that's right! Because it's not a real spot you know...OK Emily - look at at the following phrases/words and then back at your story and tell me how you can use them ok?\n",
      "teacher: pull out / get out / shaken up / get my car fixed / - if you don't know one just leave it\n",
      "teacher: as in you need to replace/correct with these\n",
      "student: I'll try...\n",
      "student: No idea about pull out\n",
      "student: I think I should have said 'they got out of their car...'\n",
      "teacher: Yes! Sorry one more: ironically you don’t really say ‘come out’ of a car and you don’t say ‘do’ a stop really BUT you can say ‘come to a stop’ (often implies gradually) – you know that phrase right? Like ‘come to an end’ and similar phrases\n",
      "teacher: Actually because gradually not really appropriate in your story to be honest...\n",
      "student: Yes, I know 'come to an end' but I didn't know 'come to a stop.' How do you use it??\n",
      "teacher: Well \u001b[6;30;42m[...fo]\u001b[0mr example ...if your car runs out of petrol it might start making noises and then come to a stop by the side of the road  (as in slowly/gradually/not all of a suddden)\n",
      "student: I'll try to use 'shaken up' now. 'I was shaken up' instead of 'I was nervous'??\n",
      "teacher: Or a plane might skid across the runway and then come to a stop etc...!\n",
      "teacher: Yes that's good for shaken up!\n",
      "teacher: By the experience you know - suggests soemthing a bit more traumatic or with an adrenaline rush\n",
      "student: Now I understand how to use 'come to a stop'. Thanks!\n",
      "teacher: although I understand maybe you wre just saying nervous because you were worried about getting to work\n",
      "teacher: but 'shaken up' definitely common/good for this event\n",
      "student: But how do you say that there was a stop sign and she didn't do it?? That was the reason why her car crashed into mine\n",
      "teacher: Ah OK ... well, it the \u001b[6;30;42m[US]\u001b[0m they say 'run a stop sign' which is logical...wait a sec\n",
      "teacher: but for me as a \u001b[6;30;42m[BRitish]\u001b[0m person I guess I'd say maybe 'I had right of way' or 'it was my right of way'\n",
      "teacher: The thing is we don't really have signs saying STOP on them in the \u001b[6;30;42m[UK]\u001b[0m you see\n",
      "student: I understand\n",
      "teacher: So ‘pull out’ is when you drive from one road onto another (especially from a junction)\n",
      "teacher: As in you're stopped and then you move into the traffic/other road - it's really  common\n",
      "student: Really?? haha I didn't know that (no stop signs in the \u001b[6;30;42m[UK]\u001b[0m)\n",
      "teacher: No!Do you know I remember the first time I went to \u001b[6;30;42m[Spain]\u001b[0m I was really confused when I Saw a stop sigh because it was written in English!\n",
      "student: hahahah that's funny\n",
      "teacher: Listen \u001b[6;30;42m[Emily - ']\u001b[0mpull' = really common for driving i.e. pull out/pull in/ pull over\n",
      "student: Pull out' wow this is a very difficult phrasal verb...\n",
      "teacher: Yeah...! So 'out' is into traffic/ 'in' is like we pulled in at the servcie station or whatever and pull over is when you stop by the side of the road!\n",
      "teacher: But all really common\n",
      "student: OK, thank you. I'll write them down\n",
      "teacher: OK ...you're happy with e.g. 'I got my car fixed' right - I'm sure you know it ....\n",
      "student: So 'pull in' means that you stop somewhere??\n",
      "teacher: Yes - at  a place I guess ..but \u001b[6;30;42m[confusingly...it]\u001b[0m can also be used for the same as pull over actually sorry! or 'had my car fixed'  = the same\n",
      "student: Sure, 'I got my car fixed' I guess I use 'to get' because I don't fix it myself??\n",
      "teacher: Yes that's right - seems like a small thing and you do hear people say 'I fixed the car' but this structure with get more \u001b[6;30;42m[normal....as]\u001b[0m in I had/got my hair cut much more common than I cut my hair yes\n",
      "student: I understand!\n",
      "student: understand\n",
      "teacher: OK - Emily sorry for the stupid question \u001b[6;30;42m[but...ar]\u001b[0me there motorways in the CAnary ISlands ?\n",
      "student: haha it is not a stupid question. Yes there are motorways. What a coincidence, \u001b[6;30;42m[yesterday]\u001b[0m I had a conversation about it. We talked about how long we have had them\n",
      "teacher: \u001b[6;30;42m[Right...so]\u001b[0m how long would it take to drive around \u001b[6;30;42m[Tenerife]\u001b[0m?\n",
      "student: I know it isn't right but I don't know how to say that... can you say that the motorway is \u001b[6;30;42m[50 years old]\u001b[0m?? I don't think so\n",
      "teacher: No that's fine! Are you worried because it's a thing? no it's normal...or fo course 'we've had motoways for \u001b[6;30;42m[50 years]\u001b[0m\n",
      "student: I'm not sure how long it would take but I think it wouldn't take \u001b[6;30;42m[more than 4 hours]\u001b[0m\n",
      "teacher: or it was built \u001b[6;30;42m[50 years]\u001b[0m a go or whatever\n",
      "teacher: OK \u001b[6;30;42m[4 hours]\u001b[0m - well in fact you can drive quite a lot of the length of \u001b[6;30;42m[England]\u001b[0m in that tie\n",

      "student: maybe 'on the road'\n",
      "student: I continue\n",
      "teacher: ok\n",
      "student: I was trying to get onto a main road, and a car didn't stop so that it crashed into my car. The driver was a very young girl and her father was also in the car\n",
      "teacher: Oh no! I'll wait ...\n",
      "student: They got out of their car and \u001b[6;30;42m[apologised]\u001b[0m because it was clearly their fault. It wasn't very serious but my car got damaged\n",
      "teacher: OK so no-one was badly hurt - that's the importnat thing\n",
      "student: I was nervous because I didn't want to be late for work so I just took their telephone number\n",
      "teacher: and on your first day you said - you mean of driving or of your job?\n",
      "student: The funny thing was that they rang their insurance company earlier than me and made up a story\n",
      "student: They said that it was my fault so I had to fix my car and pay for it. I learnt the lesson ;)\n",
      "teacher: Oh no! I guess you can never tell what people are going to do...\n",
      "teacher: Thanks \u001b[6;30;42m[LatonyaYes]\u001b[0m we say ‘on the road’ to talk in general – ‘in’ the road is like a specific place in space do you see?  So for example do we say sleep ‘in’ or ‘on’ the street for rough sleepers do you think?\n",
      "student: I don't really \u001b[6;30;42m[understand]\u001b[0m your question '-you mean of driving or of your job?'\n",

      "student: OK thank you!\n",
      "student: About on or in the road\n",
      "student: I would say that they sleep on the street\n",
      "student: Is it correct?\n",
      "teacher: Yes that's right! Because it's not a real spot you know...OK Emily - look at at the following phrases/words and then back at your story and tell me how you can use them ok?\n",
      "teacher: pull out / get out / shaken up / get my car fixed / - if you don't know one just leave it\n",
      "teacher: as in you need to replace/correct with these\n",
      "student: I'll try...\n",
      "student: No idea about pull out\n",
      "student: I think I should have said 'they got out of their car...'\n",
      "teacher: Yes! Sorry one more: \u001b[6;30;42m[ironically]\u001b[0m you don’t really say ‘come out’ of a car and you don’t say ‘do’ a stop really BUT you can say ‘come to a stop’ (often implies gradually) – you know that phrase right? Like ‘come to an end’ and similar phrases\n",
      "teacher: Actually because gradually not really appropriate in your story to be honest...\n",
      "student: Yes, I know 'come to an end' but I didn't know 'come to a stop.' How do you use it??\n",
      "teacher: Well \u001b[42;30m<URL>\u001b[0mr example ...if your car runs out of petrol it might start making noises and then come to a stop by the side of the road  (as in slowly/gradually/not all of a suddden)\n",
      "student: I'll try to use 'shaken up' now. 'I was shaken up' instead of 'I was nervous'??\n",
      "teacher: Or a plane might skid across the runway and then come to a stop etc...!\n",
      "teacher: Yes that's good for shaken up!\n",
      "teacher: By the \u001b[6;30;42m[experience]\u001b[0m you know - suggests soemthing a bit more traumatic or with an \u001b[6;30;42m[adrenaline]\u001b[0m rush\n",
      "student: Now I \u001b[6;30;42m[understand]\u001b[0m how to use 'come to a stop'. Thanks!\n",
      "teacher: although I \u001b[6;30;42m[understand]\u001b[0m maybe you wre just saying nervous because you were worried about getting to work\n",
      "teacher: but 'shaken up' \u001b[6;30;42m[definitely]\u001b[0m common/good for this event\n",
      "student: But how do you say that there was a stop sign and she didn't do it?? That was the reason why her car crashed into mine\n",
      "teacher: Ah OK ... well, it the \u001b[42;30m<LOCATION>\u001b[0m they say 'run a stop sign' which is logical...wait a sec\n",
      "teacher: but for me as a \u001b[42;30m<NRP>\u001b[0m person I guess I'd say maybe 'I had right of way' or 'it was my right of way'\n",
      "teacher: The thing is we don't really have signs saying STOP on them in the \u001b[42;30m<LOCATION>\u001b[0m you see\n",
      "student: I \u001b[6;30;42m[understand]\u001b[0m\n",
      "teacher: So ‘pull out’ is when you drive from one road onto another (\u001b[6;30;42m[especially]\u001b[0m from a junction)\n",
      "teacher: As in you're stopped and then you move into the traffic/other road - it's really  common\n",
      "student: Really?? haha I didn't know that (no stop signs in the \u001b[42;30m<LOCATION>\u001b[0m)\n",
      "teacher: No!Do you know I remember the first time I went to \u001b[42;30m<LOCATION>\u001b[0m I was really confused when I Saw a stop sigh because it was written in English!\n",
      "student: hahahah that's funny\n",
      "teacher: Listen \u001b[6;30;42m[Jeannepull]\u001b[0m' = really common for driving i.e. pull out/pull in/ pull over\n",
      "student: Pull out' wow this is a very difficult phrasal verb...\n",
      "teacher: Yeah...! So 'out' is into traffic/ 'in' is like we pulled in at the servcie station or whatever and pull over is when you stop by the side of the road!\n",
      "teacher: But all really common\n",
      "student: OK, thank you. I'll write them down\n",
      "teacher: OK ...you're happy with e.g. 'I got my car fixed' right - I'm sure you know it ....\n",
      "student: So 'pull in' means that you stop somewhere??\n",
      "teacher: Yes - at  a place I guess ..but \u001b[42;30m<URL>\u001b[0m can also be used for the same as pull over actually sorry! or 'had my car fixed'  = the same\n",
      "student: Sure, 'I got my car fixed' I guess I use 'to get' because I don't fix it myself??\n",
      "teacher: Yes that's right - seems like a small thing and you do hear people say 'I fixed the car' but this structure with get more \u001b[42;30m<URL>\u001b[0m in I had/got my hair cut much more common than I cut my hair yes\n",
      "student: I \u001b[6;30;42m[understand]\u001b[0m!\n",
      "student: \u001b[6;30;42m[understand]\u001b[0m\n",
      "teacher: OK - Emily sorry for the stupid question \u001b[42;30m<URL>\u001b[0me there motorways in the CAnary ISlands ?\n",
      "student: haha it is not a stupid question. Yes there are motorways. What a coincidence, \u001b[6;30;42m[01/01/2008]\u001b[0m I had a conversation about it. We talked about how long we have had them\n",
      "teacher: \u001b[42;30m<URL>\u001b[0m how long would it take to drive around \u001b[42;30m<LOCATION>\u001b[0m?\n",
      "student: I know it isn't right but I don't know how to say that... can you say that the motorway is \u001b[6;30;42m[01/01/2008]\u001b[0m?? I don't think so\n",
      "teacher: No that's fine! Are you worried because it's a thing? no it's normal...or fo course 'we've had motoways for \u001b[6;30;42m[01/01/2008]\u001b[0m\n",
      "student: I'm not sure how long it would take but I think it wouldn't take \u001b[6;30;42m[01/01/2008]\u001b[0m\n",
      "teacher: or it was built \u001b[6;30;42m[01/01/2008]\u001b[0m a go or whatever\n",
      "teacher: OK \u001b[6;30;42m[01/01/2008]\u001b[0m - well in fact you can drive quite a lot of the length of \u001b[42;30m<LOCATION>\u001b[0m in that tie\n",
      "teacher: time\n",
      "student: Thank you!! yes, I didn't know if you could use \u001b[6;30;42m[01/01/2008]\u001b[0m' for things...\n",
      "teacher: did you ever drive in the \u001b[42;30m<LOCATION>\u001b[0m?\n",
      "teacher: OK yes! e.g. these shoes are \u001b[6;30;42m[01/01/2008]\u001b[0m/my house is \u001b[6;30;42m[01/01/2008]\u001b[0m etc etc\n",

      "student: About driving in the \u001b[42;30m<LOCATION>\u001b[0m\n",
      "student: Yes, I rented a car for \u001b[6;30;42m[01/01/2008]\u001b[0m of the winters I spent there\n",
      "teacher: OK right..you can guess my next question! Was it OK driving on the left?\n",
      "teacher: I mean the correct side\n",
      "student: I hated the cold so much that I thought that having a car I would enjoy my life more, but it wasn't really like that\n",
      "teacher: Oh no! That sounds like another  \u001b[6;30;42m[depressing]\u001b[0m story about miserable, grey England...\n",
      "teacher: and cold\n",
      "student: It was tricky, but having a bike since I moved there helped me a lot.\n",
      "teacher: Yes bikes are great in some places here\n",
      "student: hahah yes, \u001b[6;30;42m[depressing]\u001b[0m long grey winters...\n",

      "student: Is it grey \u001b[6;30;42m[01/01/2008]\u001b[0m??\n",
      "teacher: \u001b[6;30;42m[Daniel]\u001b[0m right now it's sunny!!!!\n",

      "teacher: Yeah I'm good thanks, just been for a run!\n",
      "student: That's a great way to start \u001b[6;30;42m[the day]\u001b[0m. I also did some exercise \u001b[6;30;42m[this morning]\u001b[0m\n",
      "student: I have done, I guess\n",
      "teacher: Yeah? what did you do? I'll come back on the have done or did in a bit\n",
      "teacher: It is more common overall to use the present perfect for e.g. \u001b[6;30;42m[this morning]\u001b[0m if it hasn’t finished yet but…it’s by no means a rule and e.g.  did is perfectly fine especially if you’re focusing on the action itself\n",
      "teacher: tell me about your exercise if you like!\n",
      "student: I try to do something every morning. \u001b[6;30;42m[This morning]\u001b[0m I went for a walk and afterwards I did some yoga at home. I'd love to run but I can't. I have something like arthrosis, so if I push myself too much I get pain everywhere...\n",
      "teacher: OK I see \u001b[6;30;42m[...to]\u001b[0mo bad about the running...but yoga is good I \u001b[6;30;42m[guess...do]\u001b[0m you find it's good mentally too? I've never really done it to be honest ...I'm too impatient I think!\n",
      "student: I understand. I thought the same before I did it for the first time. It is actually very hard, people tend to think that it is about relaxing and doing nothing, but I think it is very good for your body. It is difficult to explain but the first time I went to a class I realised that if I didn't do this kind of exercises (stretching exercises mainly) I wouldn't be able to do my shoes in \u001b[6;30;42m[10 years]\u001b[0m haha\n",
      "student: stretching\n",
      "teacher: Yes I realise it's not easy really! I can see it's really good for you particularly for as you get older(!)  - actually I do lots of runnign so I do have to do a lot of e.g. core exercises and stuff some of which aren't dissimilar to yoga...\n",
      "student: What does 'dissimilar' mean??\n",
      "teacher: not similar to \u001b[6;30;42m[...so]\u001b[0m not dissimilar \u001b[6;30;42m[means...si]\u001b[0mmilar!\n",
      "student: OK, thanks\n",
      "teacher: it's  bit of a complicated way of putting it i guess but common for educated speakers like me...(!)\n",
      "student: I think running and yoga is a very good combination. An d when I say yoga I mean exercises that help you to stretch all your muscles\n",
      "teacher: Yes I'm sure you're right...I have thought about doing yoga before so who knows? But i'm supposed to be doing kung fu with my daughter after \u001b[6;30;42m[Christmas]\u001b[0m! By the way Alexis I noticed you've typed 'tent' a couple of time for the verb 'tend' - is that just a typo??!\n",
      "teacher: Do you know what i mean by'typo' (=a typing error)\n",
      "student: Kung fu?? That sounds fun!\n",
      "teacher: Yeah well my daughter started doing it and has really got into it so I thought I'd try do some extra with her - so I can defend myself against her!\n",
      "student: Oh no, it's a mistake. I thought the verb was \\to tent\\\", I`ll correct it thanks\"\n",
      "teacher: OK sure - She hit me with her elbow \u001b[6;30;42m[the other day]\u001b[0m and it really hurt even though she's only 9\n",
      "student: haha did she hit you by accident??\n",
      "teacher: No! we were play fighting - but she takes it quite seriously hahah the tricky thing is as a parent i feel like I have to lose you know? \u001b[6;30;42m[but..at]\u001b[0m the same time I have to try to get her to cope with failure!\n",
      "student: Sure, I guess that is a difficult situation as a parent. I believe that it's not very helpful for children when parents let them win all the time but I'm not a mum\n",
      "teacher: No I think you're right - I guess kids with siblings learn the hard way but for only children I think they need to lose sometimes....did you play any sport in the past? Compettive I mean\n",
      "teacher: competitive!\n",
      "teacher: learn the hard way = learn through bad experiences in case you weren't sure by the way\n",
      "student: No, I've never played any team sports (I don't know how to say that)\n",
      "teacher: you can say 'as part of a team' or 'in a team' or 'team sport'  - all with the verb play\n",
      "student: great\n",
      "teacher: but not 'as a team' just for yourself!\n",
      "student: I understand\n",
      "teacher: I sed to play a lot of football but then 'retired' cos of injuries and now I just run but actually I've really got into it and run races etc\n",
      "teacher: used to play\n",
      "student: I wish I had but I wasn't interested in team sports when I was younger\n",
      "teacher: yeah some kids just don't - for different reasons I guess\n",
      "student: Running is very popular in \u001b[6;30;42m[Spain]\u001b[0m at the moment\n",
      "teacher: Yeah? in the \u001b[6;30;42m[UK]\u001b[0m too I'd \u001b[6;30;42m[say....th]\u001b[0mere are lots of 'park runs' everywhere every \u001b[6;30;42m[Saturday]\u001b[0m and people just turn up and do a 5k - I go to the athletics club so a bit more than average....\n",
      "student: I think it's great! I can see many more people exercising on the streets nowadays than \u001b[6;30;42m[a few years ago]\u001b[0m\n",
      "teacher: Yes, you know one thing that I think about with running and \u001b[6;30;42m[Spain]\u001b[0m is that it  must be really hot for some of the year - as in too hot to run(?)\n",
      "teacher: When I lived there I didn't do much exercise - just smoked and drank too much!\n",
      "teacher: I gave up smoking a long time ago by the way thank god...\n",
      "student: Yes, I think you are right. I'm not sure if runners keep running in the summertime... I don't know if you know that in \u001b[6;30;42m[the Canary Islands]\u001b[0m it is generally 22 degrees \u001b[6;30;42m[all year]\u001b[0m round (is it correct?), so we don't have that problem\n",

      "student: Fags and booze?? I don't know these words\n",

      "teacher: yes that's true! when we say them it doesn't make us think of the other meaning usually! I'd say 'fag' for 'gay' (and yes it's an insult) is more \u001b[6;30;42m[American]\u001b[0m than \u001b[6;30;42m[British]\u001b[0m\n",

      "student: I search on the Internet\n",
      "teacher: no that's good - just wanted to check - lots of non-natives use 'search' a lot now because of the internet of course  - it's fine for that but they use it too much for other things you see - look up and check = perfect\n",

I'd love to run but I can't. I have something like arthrosis, so if I push myself too much I get pain \u001b[6;30;42m[everywhere]\u001b[0m...\n",

      "student: I \u001b[6;30;42m[understand]\u001b[0m. I thought the same before I did it for the first time. It is actually very hard, people tend to think that it is about relaxing and doing nothing, but I think it is very good for your body. It is difficult to explain but the first time I went to a class I realised that if I didn't do this kind of exercises (\u001b[6;30;42m[stretching]\u001b[0m exercises mainly) I wouldn't be able to do my shoes in \u001b[6;30;42m[02/16/2008]\u001b[0m haha\n",

      "teacher: Yes I'm sure you're right...I have thought about doing yoga before so who knows? But i'm supposed to be doing kung fu with my daughter after \u001b[6;30;42m[02/16/2008]\u001b[0m! By the way Alexis I noticed you've typed 'tent' a couple of time for the verb 'tend' - is that just a typo??!\n",

      "student: haha did she hit you by accident??\n",
      "teacher: No! we were play fighting - but she takes it quite seriously hahah the tricky thing is as a parent i feel like I have to lose you know? \u001b[42;30m<URL>\u001b[0m the same time I have to try to get her to cope with failure!\n",
      "student: Sure, I guess that is a difficult situation as a parent. I believe that it's not very helpful for children when parents let them win all the time but I'm not a mum\n",
      "teacher: No I think you're right - I guess kids with siblings learn the hard way but for only children I think they need to lose sometimes....did you play any sport in the past? \u001b[6;30;42m[Compettive]\u001b[0m I mean\n",
      "teacher: competitive!\n",

      "teacher: Yes, you know one thing that I think about with running and \u001b[42;30m<LOCATION>\u001b[0m is that it  must be really hot for some of the year - as in too hot to run(?)\n",

      "teacher: yes that's true! when we say them it doesn't make us think of the other meaning usually! I'd say 'fag' for 'gay' (and yes it's an insult) is more \u001b[42;30m<NRP>\u001b[0m than \u001b[42;30m<NRP>\u001b[0m\n",

      "student: I need a lot of preparation. At the moment I'm taking lessons (\u001b[6;30;42m[08/10/2008 a week]\u001b[0m, I can't afford more) and I have some books... I should spend more time studying; however, after the course I'm too tired.\n",
      "student: I see what you mean. That's very good!\n",

      "student: I think just writing here helps me. Before these 'classes' I was much more scared of writing in English\n",
      "teacher: ha! well I guess the general principle is that you can do a lot of \u001b[6;30;42m[self-study]\u001b[0m (as your an intelligent learner I'm sure!) and then (this si the key) you can do feer practice of new language to consolidate/integrate it into your \u001b[6;30;42m[productive]\u001b[0m skills (speaking and writing)\n",
      "teacher: I mean practise it by consciously using it with me\n",

      "teacher: more or less!\n",
      "student: I should do that\n",
      "teacher: yes don't worry - using new stuff is always tricky - you need to 'meet' it lots of times before \u001b[6;30;42m[Lula]\u001b[0m likely to use it\n",
      "teacher: but you can speed it up a bit by artificially focusing on it - but again it's much more effective if it's in some form of realistic communication\n",
      "student: I see. Do you do exam preparation?\n",
      "student: sorry, do you do or teach?\n",

      "student: So you know what I am supposed to know. I mean maybe we could practise \u001b[6;30;42m[vocabulary]\u001b[0m that is used in CAE... I don't know, just an idea\n",
      "student: No, I've never taken an English exam\n",
      "teacher: yes of course - that's fine and yes a good idea for you - do you have books?\n",
      "student: Yes I have two books with tests\n",

      "student: Yes\n",

      "teacher: \u001b[42;30m<URL>\u001b[0mat's a difficult question! I guess that the considerations are e.g. frequency - so higher frequency items are generally more useful of course. The trouble is of course that it's difficult for you to know that sometimes (which is why teachers are useful!) - maybe not ALL the words no - I guess sometimes you can get a feel for how useful a word is i.e. if you can see it's \u001b[6;30;42m[restricted]\u001b[0m to a very specific topic\n",
