      "student: Don't worry, my exam is \u001b[6;30;42m[02/22/2008]\u001b[0m, so I should get up early.\n",
      "teacher: Ah OK, so good practice then... is that an IELTS exam?\n",
      "student: Exactly.\n",
      "teacher: I've lost track of how many you've done\n",
      "student: I hope I can do as well as usual at the real exam. haha\n",
      "teacher: Do you mean get a score you get in practice tests?\n",
      "student: Yes, I managed to get 37 on reading \u001b[6;30;42m[02/22/2008]\u001b[0m!!\n",
      "teacher: Wow that's really good - well done... you've \u001b[6;30;42m[definitely]\u001b[0m made a lot of progress. And what's your normal score on listening \u001b[6;30;42m[02/22/2008]\u001b[0m?\n",
      "student: Around 30, the listening is harder for me.\n",
      "teacher: OK that's quite common to be better at reading - but 30 is still more than respectable. I guess maybe speaking is the toughest part?\n",
      "student: Yeah, because it's difficult to practice...\n",
      "teacher: Yeah sure - I guess what we're doing right now is a weird mixture of speaking and writing.... because you're kind of under pressure to reply straight away like in speaking you know?\n",
      "student: You're right. I'm trying to reply as soon as possible.\n",
      "teacher: Yes well don't worry too much - are you doing this one on your phone like you said you might? IS it quicker/easier?\n",
      "student: Yeah, I'm using my phone, it's better than the last time, isn't it??\n",
      "teacher: I'd say you're definitely faster yeah - this is me at maximum speed I'm afraid!\n",
      "student: It's good for me. haha\n",
      "teacher: :) Listen Myrl I thought I'd try something a bit more specific if that's OK - so here goes...\n",
      "teacher: What’s the connection?  Gibbsmouth/Gibbsmouth\n",
      "student: Do you mean my hometown?\n",
      "teacher: No I mean: what's the connection between those two words?\n",
      "student: Ah, it's the capital city\n",
      "teacher: OK yes! Tell me a sentence can you please?\n",
      "teacher: I mean with that exact example.\n",
      "student: Gibbsmouth is the capital city in Gibbsmouth.\n",
      "teacher: OK thanks - is there another capital city in Gibbsmouth?\n",
      "student: No, there is only one.\n",
      "teacher: Ah ok so... Gibbsmouth....?\n",
      "student: Gibbsmouth is the capital!!\n",
      "teacher: You got it! OK another one: What's the connection: Pacific/Everest\n",
      "student: Gibbsmouth is the highest in the Gibbsmouth...?\n",
      "teacher: OK just tell me about the second one... Gibbsmouth is....?\n",
      "student: the highest mountain in the Gibbsmouth??\n",
      "teacher: Sorry Myrl! I mean write this in a  full sentence: Gibbsmouth/highest/world\n",
      "student: Gibbsmouth is the highest in the Gibbsmouth world.\n",
      "student: I'm not sure, sorry.\n",
      "teacher: That's OK my fault! OK this is what I was thinking of: Gibbsmouth is the highest mountain in the world. Can you now do a sentence with the ocean (forget about connecting it to Gibbsmouth!) THanks\n",
      "student: The Gibbsmouth is the widest ocean in the world!!\n",
      "teacher: OK thanks great! And one more with this keyword: Gibbsmouth\n",
      "student: The Gibbsmouth is the largest desert in the world.\n",
      "teacher: OK thanks \u001b[6;30;42m[Myrl]\u001b[0m. I wanted to check this area (or part of it at first) for articles! Does that you make you change any of your answers?\n",
      "student: Sure, it's okay.\n",
      "teacher: I'll give you a clue: if you are talking about oceans/deserts/rivers you need....?\n",
      "teacher: the the the the the the the the but only once obviously\n",
      "student: Do I need to use 'the'??\n",
      "teacher: Yes!\n",
      "teacher: So, do one again with Gibbsmouth can you?\n",
      "student: The Gibbsmouth is the largest desert in the world!!\n",
      "teacher: Debra! OK \u001b[6;30;42m[Myrl]\u001b[0m,can you choose one desert, one river and one ocean and tell me anything you like about each one? THanks\n",
      "teacher: Start with just river if you like\n",
      "student: The \u001b[6;30;42m[Thames]\u001b[0m is the most famous river in the Gibbsmouth.\n",
      "teacher: Thanks great example .. and nice that you know you can just say The Gibbsmouth if you like and not always the river Gibbsmouth\n",
      "teacher: OK do a ocean/sea or desert OK?\n",
      "student: I don't know much about desertsl... so I'm talking about an ocean.\n",
      "teacher: OK fine (Sorry by the way it should Gibbsmouth as in Gibbsmouth with a capital r !)\n",
      "student: The Gibbsmouth is the ocean between Gibbsmouth and Gibbsmouth.\n",
      "teacher: OK thanks Myrl - correct 'the Gibbsmouth' perfect (I didn't understand the bit about 'is known that ' though I'm afraid!\n",
      "student: Sorry, it was an unnecessary part!!\n",
      "teacher: Ok no problem! Listen Myrl can you tell me about any famous places (like buildings) you have visited in the Gibbsmouth - just one sentnce is enough\n",
      "student: \u001b[6;30;42m[Clifford]\u001b[0m is one of the best resort places in Gibbsmouth.\n",
      "teacher: OK thanks - yes I remember you said you went there. It's pretty cool right? What did you like about it?\n",
      "teacher: And what did you do/where did you go hen you were there?\n",
      "student: I also went to Bournemouth, but \u001b[6;30;42m[Clifford]\u001b[0m is more attractive to me. Due to the landscape.\n",
      "student: I ate some seafood, it was good.\n",
      "teacher: OK right - I guess you've noticed that seafood is not the most common food for \u001b[42;30m<NRP>\u001b[0m people to eat! Can you give me an example of a specific place (like a building) you have visited in Gibbsmouth.\n",
      "teacher: I mean a well-known place\n",
      "teacher: Not like your bathroom or something!\n",
      "student: Sure. It's \u001b[6;30;42m[King's]\u001b[0m \u001b[6;30;42m[College]\u001b[0m, the garden was really beautiful.\n",
      "teacher: OK yes nice example - a really famous one. What about any museums?\n",
      "student: I like the \u001b[6;30;42m[Fitzwilliam]\u001b[0m \u001b[6;30;42m[Museum]\u001b[0m, I'm not sure about the spelling\n",
      "teacher: No that's correct Myrl! So you said your two examples correctly: The \u001b[6;30;42m[Christopher]\u001b[0m and \u001b[6;30;42m[King's]\u001b[0m \u001b[6;30;42m[College]\u001b[0m (without 'the') - do you know the (semi) rule?!\n",
      "student: I think facilities like museums need to have 'the'...\n",
      "teacher: Yes good point! So hotels/theatres/cinemas/museums/galleries etc have 'the' - can you give me another  example of one of these you've been to?\n",
      "student: The Light cinema is near to my house.\n",
      "teacher: Ah you live quite centrally - I'm jealous! (sort of) And \u001b[6;30;42m[Scott]\u001b[0m \u001b[6;30;42m[College]\u001b[0m/Barclay\u001b[6;30;42m['s]\u001b[0m (bank)/St Mary's \u001b[6;30;42m[Church]\u001b[0m do NOT have 'the' - can you see what they have in common?!\n",
      "student: It's owned by someone like \u001b[6;30;42m[Eva]\u001b[0m and \u001b[6;30;42m[Barclay]\u001b[0m??\n",
      "teacher: Yeah that's it basically! so the 'someone' is the important bit - a name! Can you give me another example of a place like this?\n",
      "student: I have no idea except \u001b[6;30;42m[Queen's]\u001b[0m \u001b[6;30;42m[College]\u001b[0m...\n",
      "teacher: No that's fine! Correct example! One final test: where does \u001b[6;30;42m[Naomi]\u001b[0m work? The building I mean...\n",
      "teacher: It's got the name of a colour in it... and it's not black!\n",
      "student: The \u001b[6;30;42m[White]\u001b[0m \u001b[6;30;42m[House]\u001b[0m. haha\n",
      "teacher: yes good! But is the colour named after a person or is it just a colour?\n",
      "teacher: do you think?\n",
      "teacher: it's just a colour so... it's called...?\n",
      "student: Hmmm, the \u001b[6;30;42m[White]\u001b[0m \u001b[6;30;42m[House]\u001b[0m!!\n",
      "teacher: Yay!\n",
      "teacher: OK thank's Myrl -we'll leave it there ok? Good to talk to you again.\n",
      "student: Okay, thank you!!\n",
      "teacher: I'll be in touch - feel free to send me an email yourself!\n",
      "student: Sure, see you.\n",
      "teacher: OK bye...\n",

      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "teacher: Hi \u001b[6;30;42m[Amy Smith]\u001b[0m - are you there?!\n",
      "student: Hi\n",
      "student: Yes, here I am :)\n",
      "teacher: Hi there - good to speak to you!\n",
      "teacher: \u001b[6;30;42m[Amy Smith]\u001b[0m - can you tell me something about yourself - whatever you like...\n",
      "student: ok\n",
      "student: I'm from \u001b[6;30;42m[Spain]\u001b[0m, from \u001b[6;30;42m[Tenerife]\u001b[0m. I came back home \u001b[6;30;42m[a week ago]\u001b[0m and I'm very happy to see the sun again.\n",
      "teacher: OK yes I can imagine! It's pretty cold here in \u001b[6;30;42m[Cambridge]\u001b[0m at the moment (sunny though!). Do you travel to the  \u001b[6;30;42m[UK]\u001b[0m often?\n",
      "student: At the moment I'm not working so I have a lot of free time to go for walks outside and enjoy the good weather\n",
      "teacher: What's your normal work?\n",
      "student: About traveling to the \u001b[6;30;42m[UK]\u001b[0m, I don't go often. I lived there for \u001b[6;30;42m[5 years]\u001b[0m until \u001b[6;30;42m[2014]\u001b[0m and then I went again at \u001b[6;30;42m[the end of October 2019]\u001b[0m\n",
      "teacher: Ah right - yes I thought you seemed very fluent - as in the thetype of fluency you get from living in a country...\n",
      "teacher: Where were you based when you were here?\n",
      "student: In my last job I worked as a careers advisor (not sure about the spelling)\n",
      "teacher: It's careers!\n",
      "student: oh thank you!\n",
      "teacher: Do you have any plans for future work?\n",
      "student: I'm not sure about what to do, I've done a few different things... I really enjoy teaching so I'm planning on taking a course to become a teacher for unemployed people. To help them to improve their qualifications\n",
      "teacher: OK I see - that sounds very valuable. Would you do that in \u001b[6;30;42m[Tenerife]\u001b[0m? Is there high unemployment there?\n",
      "student: Yes, I'd like to do it here. Unemployment is quite high in all of \u001b[6;30;42m[Spain]\u001b[0m, especially in the south\n",
      "teacher: Yes I thought it probably was. I lived in \u001b[6;30;42m[Spain]\u001b[0m (in \u001b[6;30;42m[Cadiz]\u001b[0m and \u001b[6;30;42m[Granada]\u001b[0m) for \u001b[6;30;42m[a few years - but]\u001b[0m nearly 20 years ago now - it was a problem then too. Too reliant on tourism etc. Do you think there is a solution?\n",
      "student: Oh really? Do you speak Spanish? I love \u001b[6;30;42m[Andalusia]\u001b[0m but it has always been difficult to find a job there...\n",
      "student: No idea about a solution\n",
      "teacher: Me neither (on the solution!) - well, in theory I speak Spanish but I'm afriad I'm pretty rusty these days - of course I can understand and I could regain fluency with some practice I guess but as I say it's deteriorated over \u001b[6;30;42m[the years]\u001b[0m...\n",
      "teacher: My partner has kept it up much more as she has \u001b[6;30;42m[South American]\u001b[0m friends here in \u001b[6;30;42m[CAmbridge]\u001b[0m - I'm a bit jealous to be honest especially as I used to be better than her!\n",
      "student: Unemployment is really bad but it has always given me an opportunity to work. There are always vacancies to work as a careers advisor and I did a master's in that boring topic\n",
      "teacher: Ha! Quite ironic ! I guess it's a little bit similar to me teaching English in some countries where there is high unemployment - sometimes I felt a bit guilty because ogten in reality better English didn't really make any difference to their job prospects!\n",
      "student: haha I know, it's very difficult to keep up a language if you don't practise\n",
      "teacher: Yes I guess that's why you''re keen to keep up your ENglish right? I'll stop typing for \u001b[6;30;42m[a minute]\u001b[0m to avoid overlap\n",
      "student: Same for me, I work trying to help people to get jobs but there are no jobs. I think it is our government's strategy to keep people entertained so they don't complain so much\n",
      "student: Oh sorry, we are getting some overlap... It would be great to be able to see if the other is typing\n",
      "teacher: I see what you mean... like we said it's difficult to see a solution unfortunately. I guess you need to get a competitive advantage in something right? As in something beyond food production etc\n",
      "teacher: Yes I know about the overlap - I think it's something the developer can work on\n",
      "teacher: \u001b[6;30;42m[Amy Smith]\u001b[0m - you mentioned in your form that you wanted to do a few grammar areas - can you tell me about something you regret?!\n",
      "student: Fun topic!\n",
      "teacher: sorry! lie if you like...\n",
      "student: No, I won't lie\n",
      "student: I regret not studying teaching, but I think I was too young to know what I wanted at that time\n",
      "student: Is it correct??\n",
      "teacher: OK... so if you use the actual word 'regret' you need to say regret something/regret doing something - try again\n",
      "student: ok\n",
      "student: I regret not studying teaching??\n",
      "teacher: That's it! You can also say: I regret not having studied teaching - more formal but the first one very common in speaking if no danger of confusion\n",
      "teacher: I mean over time\n",
      "student: I see. I don't tend to use that verb\n",
      "teacher: Tell me more about what what you wish (about the teaching thing) if you like\n",
      "student: Sorry, I don't usually use that verb\n",
      "teacher: It's a common verb so sounds good\n",
      "teacher: less common as a noun\n",
      "student: I understand\n",
      "teacher: Maybe \u001b[6;30;42m[English]\u001b[0m peoplle regret  things more!\n",
      "student: hahah I don't think so, but maybe I don't like to think too much about the things that I can't change in the present\n",
      "teacher: Yes of course - good advice in general!\n",
      "student: I'll tell you more about what I wish\n",
      "teacher: ok\n",
      "student: When I finished my master's I worked as a volunteer teaching Spanish to \u001b[6;30;42m[African]\u001b[0m inmigrants and then I realised I really enjoyed teaching. It was too late, I had already spent \u001b[6;30;42m[7 years]\u001b[0m at university studying something else\n",
      "student: I wish I had studied a master's in Spanish as a second language\n",
      "teacher: OK I see - good grammar by the way! - I guess teachign positions in \u001b[6;30;42m[Spain]\u001b[0m are quite controlled. Did you ever teach Spanish in the uK?\n",
      "student: Yes, it's always easier to teach Spanish in another country. I had some students, I used to teach at home. I also taught in \u001b[6;30;42m[an early years]\u001b[0m school. It wasn't a subject, it was a club\n",
      "student: How can I say that properly??\n",
      "teacher: Um... do you mean like an after-school club?\n",
      "student: Exactly\n",
      "teacher: Yeah OK if it's like an optional activity that's what we call it but 'a club' is fine\n",
      "teacher: Did you enjoy teaching kids - or do you prefer adults?\n",
      "student: I see. I worked at the same school as a teaching assistant and I also taught \u001b[6;30;42m[Spanish]\u001b[0m\n",
      "student: I very much prefer to teach adults\n",
      "teacher: Yes me too to be honest! Unfortunately the English teaching industry is more and more dominated by classes for young poeple\n",
      "student: I don't enjoy teaching children because I have the feeling that I waste too much energy asking for their attention\n",
      "student: I see a lot of adults learning English in \u001b[6;30;42m[Cambridge]\u001b[0m\n",
      "student: Are there more young students than adults?\n",
      "teacher: Sure - a lot of it is crowd control - some people are good at it - it's like a vocation I guess. I do really admire those teachers - that's why I don't consider myself a really great teacher to be honest!  Yes there are more young people overall - definitely in my school too!\n",
      "teacher: I often escape them though because i specialise in exam teaching - like IELTS/CAE etc\n",
      "student: Yes, I completely agree. I think to work with children you have to love the way they are.\n",
      "teacher: \u001b[6;30;42m[Amy Smith]\u001b[0m - we'll finish at \u001b[6;30;42m[2:00 OK]\u001b[0m? so I'll ask you to have a quick look at the following:\n",
      "student: OK\n",
      "teacher: A few things from earlier to think about: • I walk outside (in the good weather) • There’s high unemployment in all \u001b[6;30;42m[Spain]\u001b[0m • It has been always difficult to find work • There’s a possibility to work.. •Vacancies to work in teaching… • (I wish I’d) studied a Master’s in…\n",
      "teacher: Change anything you like (one by one if you like - you decide)\n",
      "student: I'm not sure about what I have to do. Are these the sentences that I wrote??\n",
      "teacher: Yes! Sorry I thought you'd recognize them! Yes have a go at identifying any issues\n",
      "student: The first one: I walk outdoors\n",
      "teacher: OK thanks - do you walk inside? Normally we'd say go for a walk (as in for fun/in the countryside whatever) more common anyway\n",
      "student: I see, thank you\n",
      "teacher: Any others?\n",
      "student: yes, I'll try with the second one\n",
      "student: The unemployment is high in the whole country (not sure)\n",
      "teacher: all \u001b[6;30;42m[Spain]\u001b[0m' is not wrong just a bit unusual - all of \u001b[6;30;42m[Spain]\u001b[0m or various alternative obviously: all over \u001b[6;30;42m[Spain]\u001b[0m/through (more formal) Spain/ yes whole country = fine definitely not THE unemploymen though!\n",
      "teacher: sorry I meant throughout \u001b[6;30;42m[Spain]\u001b[0m\n",
      "student: OK, thanks\n",
      "teacher: next one =word order do you see it?\n",
      "student: It has always been very difficult to find a job\n",
      "student: It has always been\n",
      "student: sorry\n",
      "teacher: That's OK that's it yes!\n",
      "teacher: change the word possiblity\n",
      "student: Thanks, I'll go for the next one\n",
      "student: there is a chance to work??\n",
      "teacher: yes good! or opportunity of course = both good. possibility is more like a statistical thing you know\n",
      "teacher: vacancy + preposition?\n",
      "student: No, I don't understand the 'statistical thing'\n",
      "teacher: OK so for example: there's a possibility it will rain\n",
      "student: Ah I understand now\n",
      "student: vacancies for\n",
      "student: vacancies for working in\n",
      "teacher: basically for a \u001b[6;30;42m[Spanish]\u001b[0m speaker you normally need to say chance/opportunity when you want to say possibility! \u001b[6;30;42m[YEs]\u001b[0m good vacancy for - change the verb in the last one\n",
      "student: And the last one?? I don't know how to change it\n",
      "teacher: That's ok - study a master's in not wrong but much more common to say 'do'\n",
      "teacher: much much more\n",
      "student: OK, I didn't know... I translated directly from \u001b[6;30;42m[Spanish]\u001b[0m\n",
      "teacher: yes of course\n",
      "student: Thank you very much\n",
      "teacher: Listen \u001b[6;30;42m[Amy Smith]\u001b[0m - it was good to speak to you \u001b[6;30;42m[today]\u001b[0m - by the way of course you're English is great! I'll email you soon to confirm what we want to do OK?\n",
      "student: Thank you, this is a very good exercise for me because I don't like writing. Thank you, I have a lot to improve\n",
      "student: I'll be waiting for your email.\n",
      "teacher: OK no problem - you did fine! OK thanks a lot - speak soon\n",

I lived in \u001b[6;30;42m[Lake]\u001b[0m \u001b[6;30;42m[Barbara]\u001b[0m (in \u001b[6;30;42m[Lake]\u001b[0m \u001b[6;30;42m[Barbara]\u001b[0m and \u001b[6;30;42m[Lake]\u001b[0m \u001b[6;30;42m[Barbara]\u001b[0m) for \u001b[6;30;42m[06/28/2008]\u001b[0m now - it was a problem then too. Too reliant on tourism etc. Do you think there is a solution?\n",

      "teacher: Ha! Quite ironic ! I guess it's a little bit similar to me teaching English in some countries where there is high unemployment - sometimes I felt a bit guilty because ogten in reality better English didn't really make any \u001b[6;30;42m[difference]\u001b[0m to their job prospects!\n",

      "student: Same for me, I work trying to help people to get jobs but there are no jobs. I think it is our \u001b[6;30;42m[government]\u001b[0m's strategy to keep people entertained so they don't complain so much\n",
      "student: Oh sorry, we are getting some overlap... It would be great to be able to see if the other is typing\n",
      "teacher: I see what you mean... like we said it's difficult to see a solution unfortunately. I guess you need to get a competitive advantage in something right? As in something beyond food \u001b[6;30;42m[production]\u001b[0m etc\n",

      "student: ok\n",
      "student: I regret not studying teaching??\n",

      "teacher: Yes of course - good advice in general!\n",
      "student: I'll tell you more about what I wish\n",
      "teacher: ok\n",
      "student: When I finished my master's I worked as a volunteer teaching Spanish to \u001b[42;30m<NRP>\u001b[0m \u001b[6;30;42m[inmigrants]\u001b[0m and then I realised I really enjoyed teaching. It was too late, I had already spent \u001b[6;30;42m[06/28/2008]\u001b[0m at \u001b[6;30;42m[university]\u001b[0m studying something else\n",
      "student: I wish I had studied a master's in Spanish as a second language\n",
      "teacher: OK I see - good grammar by the way! - I guess teachign positions in \u001b[6;30;42m[Lake]\u001b[0m \u001b[6;30;42m[Barbara]\u001b[0m are quite \u001b[6;30;42m[controlled]\u001b[0m. Did you ever teach Spanish in \u001b[6;30;42m[the]\u001b[0m \u001b[6;30;42m[uK]\u001b[0m?\n",
      "student: Yes, it's always easier to teach Spanish in another country. I had some students, I used to teach at home. I also taught in \u001b[6;30;42m[06/28/2008]\u001b[0m school. It wasn't a subject, it was a club\n",
      "student: How can I say that properly??\n",
      "teacher: Um... do you mean like an after-school club?\n",
      "student: Exactly\n",
      "teacher: Yeah OK if it's like an optional activity that's what we call it but 'a club' is fine\n",
      "teacher: Did you enjoy teaching kids - or do you prefer adults?\n",
      "student: I see. I worked at the same school as a teaching assistant and I also taught \u001b[42;30m<NRP>\u001b[0m\n",
      "student: I very much prefer to teach adults\n",
      "teacher: Yes me too to be honest! Unfortunately the English teaching industry is more and more dominated by classes for young poeple\n",
      "student: I don't enjoy teaching children because I have the feeling that I waste too much energy asking for their attention\n",
      "student: I see a lot of adults learning English in \u001b[6;30;42m[Lake]\u001b[0m \u001b[6;30;42m[Barbara]\u001b[0m\n",
      "student: Are there more young students than adults?\n",
      "teacher: Sure - a lot of it is crowd control - some people are good at it - it's like a vocation I guess. I do really admire those teachers - that's why I don't consider myself a really great teacher to be honest!  Yes there are more young people overall - \u001b[6;30;42m[definitely]\u001b[0m in my school too!\n",
      "teacher: I often escape them though because i \u001b[6;30;42m[specialise]\u001b[0m in exam teaching - like IELTS/CAE etc\n",
      "student: Yes, I \u001b[6;30;42m[completely]\u001b[0m agree. I think to work with children you have to love the way they are.\n",
      "teacher: \u001b[6;30;42m[Andy]\u001b[0m - we'll finish at \u001b[6;30;42m[06/28/2008]\u001b[0m? so I'll ask you to have a quick look at the following:\n",
      "student: OK\n",
      "teacher: A few things from earlier to think about: • I walk outside (in the good weather) • There’s high unemployment in all \u001b[6;30;42m[Lake]\u001b[0m \u001b[6;30;42m[Barbara]\u001b[0m • It has been always difficult to find work • There’s a possibility to work.. •Vacancies to work in teaching… • (I wish I’d) studied a Master’s in…\n",
      "teacher: Change anything you like (one by one if you like - you decide)\n",
      "student: I'm not sure about what I have to do. Are these the sentences that I wrote??\n",
      "teacher: Yes! Sorry I thought you'd recognize them! Yes have a go at identifying any issues\n",
      "student: The first one: I walk outdoors\n",
      "teacher: OK thanks - do you walk inside? Normally we'd say go for a walk (as in for fun/in the countryside whatever) more common anyway\n",
      "student: I see, thank you\n",
      "teacher: Any others?\n",
      "student: yes, I'll try with the second one\n",
      "student: The unemployment is high in the whole country (not sure)\n",

      "student: No, I don't \u001b[6;30;42m[understand]\u001b[0m the 'statistical thing'\n",
      "teacher: OK so for example: there's a possibility it will rain\n",

      "teacher: basically for a \u001b[42;30m<NRP>\u001b[0m speaker you normally need to say chance/opportunity when you want to say possibility! Steven good vacancy for - change the verb in the last one\n",
      "student: And the last one?? I don't know how to change it\n",
      "teacher: That's ok - study a master's in not wrong but much more common to say 'do'\n",
      "teacher: much much more\n",

      "teacher: Hi there - good to speak to you again. \u001b[6;30;42m[Emily]\u001b[0m, I thought I'd make this lesson a bit more focused so here goes! Can i ask you to write a sentnece using the following information: Pacific/biggest\n",
      "student: \u001b[6;30;42m[The Pacific Ocean]\u001b[0m is the biggest ocean in the world.\n",
      "teacher: Thank you - another one: \u001b[6;30;42m[Nile]\u001b[0m/longest\n",
      "student: The \u001b[6;30;42m[Nile]\u001b[0m is the longest river in the world.\n",
      "teacher: OK nearly there! Everest/\u001b[6;30;42m[Himalayas]\u001b[0m\n",
      "student: \u001b[6;30;42m[Mt. Everest]\u001b[0m is the highest in the \u001b[6;30;42m[Himalayas]\u001b[0m.\n",
      "teacher: Thanks - USA/50 states\n",
      "student: The \u001b[6;30;42m[USA]\u001b[0m has 50 states.\n",
      "teacher: OK last one: London/south/ \u001b[6;30;42m[UK]\u001b[0m Newcastle/north\n",
      "student: \u001b[6;30;42m[London]\u001b[0m is in the south of the \u001b[6;30;42m[UK]\u001b[0m while \u001b[6;30;42m[Newcastle]\u001b[0m is in the north.\n",
      "teacher: OK \u001b[6;30;42m[Emily]\u001b[0m thanks a lot for that - I was checking your use of articles with geographical features etc as you might have guessed  - you've passed with flying colours! I'll think of some more stuff to challenge you! In the meantime, I thought I'd revisit a bit of vocabulary you did in the lesson at Studio \u001b[6;30;42m[the other day]\u001b[0m ok? give me a second\n",
      "student: What does 'flying colours' mean?\n",
      "teacher: Do you remember the lesson you did with the folowing adjectives? \u001b[6;30;42m[e. g.]\u001b[0m relieved/confused/optimistic/annoyed etc? Could you give me a setence (true if possible) to describe a time you expereinced any of these feelings I just mentioned in the list?\n",
      "teacher: Oh sorry - in this context it means you passed to a high standard\n",
      "teacher: you got a high mark basically\n",
      "student: Oh, I see. Thank you for telling me.\n",
      "student: I was really relieved to hear my husband say my cooking was delicious.\n",
      "teacher: I checked the origin of the flying colours phrase - apparently it comes from the NAvy when a ship would return with colours displayed to show it had been victorious in a battle\n",
      "teacher: f you get a very high mark in \u001b[6;30;42m[e. g.]\u001b[0m a university degree you might receive a 'distinction' if you're familiar with that idea\n",
      "teacher: Thanks for your example with relieved -  try another adjective when you're ready\n",
      "student: That's interesting. Thank you for telling me the origin of the phrase.\n",
      "teacher: \u001b[6;30;42m[THat]\u001b[0m's OK - do you know the word 'nautical'? as in related to the sailing - there are loads of phrases related to this area in English\n",
      "student: Oh, I didn't know that word. Maybe that's because the \u001b[6;30;42m[UK]\u001b[0m is an island country.\n",
      "student: Sorry, my next example...\n",
      "student: I was confused when I heard about my grandmother's death.\n",
      "student: I didn't use to be optimistic when I was a student.\n",
      "teacher: Yeah - and remember it has a very strong naval tradition - that's what kept \u001b[6;30;42m[the BRitish Empire]\u001b[0m going for so long! I'll get some examples for our next lesson of common phrases derived from this. OK thanks for your confused example - sorry if it's a sad subject ... but this suggests you didn't understand something.... is that true for your example?\n",
      "student: Yes, unfortunately it's true and I went back to \u001b[6;30;42m[Japan]\u001b[0m \u001b[6;30;42m[two weeks ago]\u001b[0m because of this. I was so confused because she had been absolutely fine until \u001b[6;30;42m[that day]\u001b[0m.\n",
      "teacher: OK thanks I understand. I think maybe 'shocked' is better here.\n",
      "teacher: \u001b[6;30;42m[Emily]\u001b[0m, can you give me the missing two words in the following: I’m optimistic _______ my chances of winning. I was confused ______ the explanation.\n",
      "student: I'm optimistic for... and I was confused with...?\n",
      "student: Ah, I understood that 'shocked' is better.\n",
      "teacher: OK thanks - we normally say 'optimistic about' and 'confused by'. Can you try to think of two more examples using these structures correctly (true if possible!)\n",
      "student: Oh, it's difficult! I was annoyed by the cancellation of my train.\n",
      "teacher: It's OK, that's a good example thanks!\n",
      "teacher: \u001b[6;30;42m[Emily]\u001b[0m, look at these two groups of adjectives  - which preposition do you need with group 1 and group 2? • Happy/sad/excited/worried • Shocked/puzzled/surprised\n",
      "student: About for 1, and by for 2, right?\n",
      "teacher: Yes that's it good! You can kind of see the similarity with the adjective groups - though it's not exactly a rule!\n",
      "teacher: Could you try a sentence with: impressed and bored\n",
      "student: I think group 1 is more emotional... is that right?\n",
      "student: I was impressed by her works.\n",
      "student: I was bored with his story.\n",
      "teacher: Yeah I guess that's true... also, it's more like a reaction to a general situation and the others are often assciated with a smaller, more contained event\n",
      "teacher: sorry not a great explanation but you get the idea?!\n",
      "student: Hmm... I have to get used to it!\n",
      "teacher: THanks - 'impressed by' or 'with' is good. 'bored of' is possible and peopel say it in real life though some more careful speakers prefer 'bored with' = more 'correct'\n",
      "student: Thank you. I understood.\n",
      "teacher: I'll think again about my explanation before and improve it for next time with examples!\n",
      "student: Thank you. Is there any rule??\n",
      "student: Sorry, 'rules'\n",
      "teacher: One last task on this topic \u001b[6;30;42m[Emily]\u001b[0m: could you tell me a time you were: suspicious/curious By the way, sorry no rule! Adjectives + prepositions is a bit unpredictable I'm afraid...\n",
      "teacher: Rule inthe singular was OK because you can think of all adjectives together in one group\n",
      "student: I see. Thank you.\n",
      "teacher: \u001b[6;30;42m[e. g.]\u001b[0m you can imagine one rule covering everything or many rules\n",
      "student: I was suspicious of his story.\n",
      "student: I am curious about the group activity.\n",
      "teacher: \u001b[6;30;42m[THanks Emily - ']\u001b[0msuspicious of' is much more common but 'about' is OK too! curious about is good...\n",
      "student: Wow.. there are many kinds of preposition!\n",
      "teacher: Yeah sorry - keep using them and it will become automatic - Do you know the nouns? Take a quick look back and write the nouns of any of the adjectives you've done...\n",
      "teacher: 4 or 5 if you like\n",
      "student: Do you mean like 'curiosity?'\n",
      "teacher: Exactly\n",
      "student: impression, relief, confusion,excitement\n",
      "teacher: Thanks - could you choose two of those and give me an example?\n",
      "student: The film made an impression on me.\n",
      "teacher: Thanks Emily - do you mean : I was impressed by the film?\n",
      "student: Yes. Is that correct?\n",
      "teacher: Sorry I mean Emily - unfortunate error!\n",
      "teacher: You need to say: the film made an impression on me\n",
      "student: Make an impression.... and this time I need 'on'\n",
      "student: Thank you for telling me.\n",
      "teacher: If you use the adjective form it's more normal to mean it in a straight-forward positive sense whereas the noun phrase is slightly more ambiguous (probably basically positive though)\n",
      "student: The accident caused traffic chaos.\n",
      "teacher: Thanks - the noun confusion goes with \u001b[6;30;42m[e. g.]\u001b[0m cause so for example: the mistake caused a great deal of confusion - for traffic we'd say something like 'chaos' maybe as in the accident caused (that verb again - or led to etc) traffic chaos\n",
      "teacher: Could you try relief or excitement? I thin k this is useful...\n",
      "student: The result of an exam was a relief to me.\n",
      "teacher: \u001b[6;30;42m[THanks Emily - yes]\u001b[0m, good example and you can say a relief FOR... it's common to say: it was relief to me. Also the phrase is quite common: it came as a relief to me\n",
      "teacher: which is maybe less familiar to you (again, with 'familiar' you could say 'for' but 'to' is more normal\n",
      "teacher: much more normal\n",
      "teacher: Last question \u001b[6;30;42m[Emily]\u001b[0m - do you know 'relieve' as a verb? Culd you give me an example of that?!\n",
      "student: OK... I have a lot of things to learn \u001b[6;30;42m[today]\u001b[0m!\n",
      "teacher: We can stop there if you like! Give me  a second...(or continue with example if you prefer!\n",
      "student: Ah, of course it's OK! His story relieved me.\n",
      "teacher: THanks - a logical example... but (!) ... have you seen for example adverts for painkillers? They always say 'fast,efffective pain relief' ... so... what can you releive\n",
      "teacher: I mean relieve\n",
      "student: I can relieve pain?\n",
      "teacher: That's it! It nearly always goes with \u001b[6;30;42m[e. g.]\u001b[0m relieve pain/worry/traffic congestion (!) - stuff like that\n",
      "teacher: OK \u001b[6;30;42m[Emily]\u001b[0m thanks for \u001b[6;30;42m[today]\u001b[0m - did you prefer the lesson \u001b[6;30;42m[today]\u001b[0m? Would you like more of the same?\n",
      "student: I see. It seems to be a very useful word.\n",
      "student: Thank you. I could learn a lot!\n",
      "teacher: OK great... I'll contact you soon for the next lesson OK?\n",

I'll think of some more stuff to challenge you! In the meantime, I thought I'd revisit a bit of \u001b[6;30;42m[vocabulary]\u001b[0m you did in the lesson at Studio \u001b[6;30;42m[07/18/2008]\u001b[0m ok? give me a second\n",

OK thanks for your confused example - sorry if it's a sad subject ... but this suggests you didn't \u001b[6;30;42m[understand]\u001b[0m something.... is that true for your example?\n",
      "student: Yes, unfortunately it's true and I went back to Tinaside \u001b[6;30;42m[07/18/2008]\u001b[0m because of this. I was so confused because she had been \u001b[6;30;42m[absolutely]\u001b[0m fine until \u001b[6;30;42m[07/18/2008]\u001b[0m.\n",

      "student: Hmm... I have to get used to it!\n",
      "teacher: THanks - 'impressed by' or 'with' is good. 'bored of' is possible and peopel say it in real life though some more careful speakers prefer 'bored with' = more 'correct'\n",

      "student: The accident caused traffic chaos.\n",
      "teacher: Thanks - the noun confusion goes with Margret cause so for example: the mistake caused a great deal of confusion - for traffic we'd say something like 'chaos' maybe as in the accident caused (that verb again - or led to etc) traffic chaos\n",
      "teacher: Could you try relief or \u001b[6;30;42m[excitement]\u001b[0m? I thin k this is useful...\n",
      "student: The result of an exam was a relief to me.\n",
      "teacher: Elisa, good example and you can say a relief FOR... it's common to say: it was relief to me. Also the phrase is quite common: it came as a relief to me\n",

      "student: Hi Ms. \u001b[6;30;42m[Emily Collins]\u001b[0m\n",
      "student: I can see more people here, is it right?\n",
      "teacher: Hi there, how's it going?\n",
      "teacher: No it's only us I think..\n",
      "student: I'm very well, thank you. How about you?\n",
      "teacher: Yeah fine thanks... not so busy at the moment to be honest. I finished the teacher training course stuff\n",
      "student: That's good!!\n",
      "teacher: Yes, I've got to buy a car, which is fine but a bit stressful you know\n",
      "teacher: I'm trying to decide between the crap tight-fisted option or a newer more \u001b[6;30;42m[xpensive]\u001b[0m car\n",
      "student: Ugh, I can imagine. I think it takes time, looking for the one you like and trying different ones... (do you say 'trying' for cars?)\n",
      "teacher: You say 'try out' for a car - a good phrasal verb!\n",
      "student: Thank you!\n",
      "teacher: But you can just say try of course\n",
      "teacher: It just makes it slightly less formal\n",
      "teacher: to use the phrasal verb i mean\n",
      "student: I see\n",
      "teacher: But very very common in speech of course\n",
      "teacher: So I tried a few - 'had a test drive we say' - and of course the most expensive one qwas by far the nicest to drive\n",
      "teacher: a volkswagen golf\n",
      "teacher: so now I'm finding it difficult to face buying a crapper cheaper car\n",
      "student: hahaha\n",
      "teacher: yeah.... so sorry I'll wait for you to reply - do you drive?\n",
      "student: If you don't want to spend a lot  I guess you shouldn't try out a good one\n",
      "teacher: yes you're right of course - i guess that was me kinda deciiding really just by trying it out\n",
      "teacher: so i thin k i'll borrow the money and just enjoy driving it!\n",
      "student: yes, I drive but I'm not interested in cars... I have never been. My father loves cars so he bought mine long time ago and it is still working very well\n",
      "teacher: OK I see - yes I'm not really that bothered about cars in general - I've had a Nissan for \u001b[6;30;42m[12 years]\u001b[0m\n",
      "student: I wouldn't like to spend money on a car\n",
      "teacher: Yeah I understand what you mean - i'm not normally extravagant with stuff\n",
      "teacher: spend 'on' by the way - you knew that right?\n",
      "student: I understand what you mean too.\n",
      "student: spend on, yes!!! thanks\n",
      "teacher: OK - I don't care what it looks like really - but it was fun to drive!\n",
      "student: So then you should borrow the money and enjoy driving it!\n",
      "teacher: Yes I think you're right! Hey \u001b[6;30;42m[Emily]\u001b[0m, thinking about cars and your phrasal verb before ... driving is a rich area for that language\n",
      "student: I don't like driving but it is definitely better when the car is comfortable\n",
      "teacher: Can you tell me about any driving incidents or expereinces you might want to explain in English?\n",
      "teacher: I'll give you a minute OK?\n",
      "student: ok\n",
      "student: I have been lucky on the road so far, I haven't had many incidents. Once I had a little accident going to work (on \u001b[6;30;42m[my first day]\u001b[0m)\n",
      "student: maybe 'on the road'\n",
      "student: I continue\n",
      "teacher: ok\n",
      "student: I was trying to get onto a main road, and a car didn't stop so that it crashed into my car. The driver was a very young girl and her father was also in the car\n",
      "teacher: Oh no! I'll wait ...\n",
      "student: They got out of their car and apologised because it was clearly their fault. It wasn't very serious but my car got damaged\n",
      "teacher: OK so no-one was badly hurt - that's the importnat thing\n",
      "student: I was nervous because I didn't want to be late for work so I just took their telephone number\n",
      "teacher: and on your first day you said - you mean of driving or of your job?\n",
      "student: The funny thing was that they rang their insurance company earlier than me and made up a story\n",
      "student: They said that it was my fault so I had to fix my car and pay for it. I learnt the lesson ;)\n",
      "teacher: Oh no! I guess you can never tell what people are going to do...\n",
      "teacher: Thanks \u001b[6;30;42m[Emily -  ]\u001b[0mYes we say ‘on the road’ to talk in general – ‘in’ the road is like a specific place in space do you see?  So for example do we say sleep ‘in’ or ‘on’ the street for rough sleepers do you think?\n",
      "student: I don't really understand your question '-you mean of driving or of your job?'\n",
      "student: It was my first day at work \u001b[6;30;42m[10 years ago]\u001b[0m\n",
      "teacher: Sorry I meant was it your first day driving after you passed your test or your first day at your new job but you've answered that now I see...!\n",
      "student: OK thank you!\n",
      "student: About on or in the road\n",
      "student: I would say that they sleep on the street\n",
      "student: Is it correct?\n",
      "teacher: Yes that's right! Because it's not a real spot you know... OK Emily - look at at the following phrases/words and then back at your story and tell me how you can use them ok?\n",
      "teacher: pull out / get out / shaken up / get my car fixed / - if you don't know one just leave it\n",
      "teacher: as in you need to replace/correct with these\n",
      "student: I'll try...\n",
      "student: No idea about pull out\n",
      "student: I think I should have said 'they got out of their car...'\n",
      "teacher: Yes! Sorry one more: ironically you don’t really say ‘come out’ of a car and you don’t say ‘do’ a stop really BUT you can say ‘come to a stop’ (often implies gradually) – you know that phrase right? Like ‘come to an end’ and similar phrases\n",
      "teacher: Actually because gradually not really appropriate in your story to be honest...\n",
      "student: Yes, I know 'come to an end' but I didn't know 'come to a stop.' How do you use it??\n",
      "teacher: Well ... for example ... if your car runs out of petrol it might start making noises and then come to a stop by the side of the road  (as in slowly/gradually/not all of a suddden)\n",
      "student: I'll try to use 'shaken up' now. 'I was shaken up' instead of 'I was nervous'??\n",
      "teacher: Or a plane might skid across the runway and then come to a stop etc...!\n",
      "teacher: Yes that's good for shaken up!\n",
      "teacher: By the experience you know - suggests soemthing a bit more traumatic or with an adrenaline rush\n",
      "student: Now I understand how to use 'come to a stop'. Thanks!\n",
      "teacher: although I understand maybe you wre just saying nervous because you were worried about getting to work\n",
      "teacher: but 'shaken up' definitely common/good for this event\n",
      "student: But how do you say that there was a stop sign and she didn't do it?? That was the reason why her car crashed into mine\n",
      "teacher: Ah OK ... well, it the \u001b[6;30;42m[US]\u001b[0m they say 'run a stop sign' which is logical... wait a sec\n",
      "teacher: but for me as a \u001b[6;30;42m[BRitish]\u001b[0m person I guess I'd say maybe 'I had right of way' or 'it was my right of way'\n",
      "teacher: The thing is we don't really have signs saying STOP on them in the \u001b[6;30;42m[UK]\u001b[0m you see\n",
      "student: I understand\n",
      "teacher: So ‘pull out’ is when you drive from one road onto another (especially from a junction)\n",
      "teacher: As in you're stopped and then you move into the traffic/other road - it's really  common\n",
      "student: Really?? haha I didn't know that (no stop signs in the \u001b[6;30;42m[UK]\u001b[0m)\n",
      "teacher: No!Do you know I remember the first time I went to \u001b[6;30;42m[Spain]\u001b[0m I was really confused when I Saw a stop sigh because it was written in English!\n",
      "student: hahahah that's funny\n",
      "teacher: Listen \u001b[6;30;42m[Emily - ']\u001b[0mpull' = really common for driving \u001b[6;30;42m[i. e.]\u001b[0m pull out/pull in/ pull over\n",
      "student: Pull out' wow this is a very difficult phrasal verb...\n",
      "teacher: Yeah...! So 'out' is into traffic/ 'in' is like we pulled in at the servcie station or whatever and pull over is when you stop by the side of the road!\n",
      "teacher: But all really common\n",
      "student: OK, thank you. I'll write them down\n",
      "teacher: OK ... you're happy with \u001b[6;30;42m[e. g. ']\u001b[0mI got my car fixed' right - I'm sure you know it ....\n",
      "student: So 'pull in' means that you stop somewhere??\n",
      "teacher: Yes - at  a place I guess .. but confusingly... it can also be used for the same as pull over actually sorry! or 'had my car fixed'  = the same\n",
      "student: Sure, 'I got my car fixed' I guess I use 'to get' because I don't fix it myself??\n",
      "teacher: Yes that's right - seems like a small thing and you do hear people say 'I fixed the car' but this structure with get more normal.... as in I had/got my hair cut much more common than I cut my hair yes\n",
      "student: I understand!\n",
      "student: understand\n",
      "teacher: OK - Emily sorry for the stupid question but... are there motorways in the CAnary ISlands ?\n",
      "student: haha it is not a stupid question. Yes there are motorways. What a coincidence, \u001b[6;30;42m[yesterday]\u001b[0m I had a conversation about it. We talked about how long we have had them\n",
      "teacher: Right... so how long would it take to drive around \u001b[6;30;42m[Tenerife]\u001b[0m?\n",
      "student: I know it isn't right but I don't know how to say that... can you say that the motorway is \u001b[6;30;42m[50 years old]\u001b[0m?? I don't think so\n",
      "teacher: No that's fine! Are you worried because it's a thing? no it's normal... or fo course 'we've had motoways for \u001b[6;30;42m[50 years]\u001b[0m\n",
      "student: I'm not sure how long it would take but I think it wouldn't take \u001b[6;30;42m[more than 4 hours]\u001b[0m\n",
      "teacher: or it was built \u001b[6;30;42m[50 years]\u001b[0m a go or whatever\n",
      "teacher: OK \u001b[6;30;42m[4 hours]\u001b[0m - well in fact you can drive quite a lot of the length of \u001b[6;30;42m[England]\u001b[0m in that tie\n",
      "teacher: time\n",
      "student: Thank you!! yes, I didn't know if you could use \u001b[6;30;42m['years old]\u001b[0m' for things...\n",
      "teacher: did you ever drive in the \u001b[6;30;42m[UK]\u001b[0m?\n",
      "teacher: OK yes! \u001b[6;30;42m[e. g.]\u001b[0m these shoes are \u001b[6;30;42m[a year old]\u001b[0m/my house is \u001b[6;30;42m[80 years old]\u001b[0m etc etc\n",
      "student: Sorry, my laptop ran out of battery but I'm back\n",
      "teacher: OK great!\n",
      "teacher: Sorry did you ever drive in the \u001b[6;30;42m[UK]\u001b[0m?\n",
      "student: Good examples (shoes and house)\n",
      "student: About driving in the \u001b[6;30;42m[UK]\u001b[0m\n",
      "student: Yes, I rented a car for \u001b[6;30;42m[a month one]\u001b[0m of the winters I spent there\n",
      "teacher: OK right.. you can guess my next question! Was it OK driving on the left?\n",
      "teacher: I mean the correct side\n",
      "student: I hated the cold so much that I thought that having a car I would enjoy my life more, but it wasn't really like that\n",
      "teacher: Oh no! That sounds like another  depressing story about miserable, grey England...\n",
      "teacher: and cold\n",
      "student: It was tricky, but having a bike since I moved there helped me a lot.\n",
      "teacher: Yes bikes are great in some places here\n",
      "student: hahah yes, depressing long grey winters...\n",
      "teacher: aahh stop\n",
      "student: hahah\n",
      "student: Is it grey \u001b[6;30;42m[today]\u001b[0m??\n",
      "teacher: \u001b[6;30;42m[ACtually]\u001b[0m right now it's sunny!!!!\n",
      "teacher: Give it \u001b[6;30;42m[30 years]\u001b[0m it'll be a paradies\n",
      "student: Fantastic!! Leave the laptop and go out :)\n",
      "teacher: paradise\n",
      "teacher: Yes OK thanks \u001b[6;30;42m[Emily - I]\u001b[0m'll say goodbye - Il email you after this about another lesson OK? Thanks...\n",
      "student: I got a bit crazy about the sun when I lived there and even after. I couldn't be indoors when it was sunny\n",
      "teacher: I can imagine if you're used to that kind  of weather.... OK bye\n",
      "student: Bye bye\n",
      "student: Thank you very much\n",
