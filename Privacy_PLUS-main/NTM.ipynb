      "\n",
      "A mind map is a diagram used to represent words, ideas, tasks, readings,  pictures, or other concepts linked and radically arranged through a keyword  or central idea. Mind maps are a very effective method for extracting and  memorizing information. They are a logical and creative way of taking notes,  organizing, associating and expressing ideas, which consists of mapping  your reflections on a topic. It is represented by means of drawing images, or  it may not include these and carry colors for a better representation of the  chosen theme.\n",
      "\n",
      "A mind map is an image of different elements, used as key points, that  provide information specific to a particular topic or the branching of several  topics in relation to a central point. It is also a graphic manifestation of radial  thought where branches radiate from a central nucleus in all directions when  we associate ideas. It is to capture all the information in a single plane. Mind  maps are considered as visual cues to better convey thought, synthesize  knowledge and achieve meaningful learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Within mind maps you can use keywords, signs, symbols, pictures, codes,  abbreviations. With mind maps you learn to organize and associate ideas.  To better understand what a mind map is, let's imagine a map of a city. The  center of the city represents the main idea; the main avenues leading to the  center represent the key thoughts of the mental process; minor streets  represent secondary thoughts, etc. images or special shapes may represent  especially important monuments or ideas.\n",
      "\n",
      "I chose the subject of mind maps, because it is a tool that helps me organize  the information efficiently, so the diagram is a good tool to represent our  information and it is a good way to understand the information, in addition to  being as an image that makes the information more enjoyable, so it groups it  together and draws important ideas from the important item.\n",
