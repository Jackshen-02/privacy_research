      "student: I continue\n",
      "teacher: ok\n",

      "teacher: Oh no! I'll wait ...\n",
      "student: They got out of their car and apologised because it was clearly their fault. It wasn't very serious but my car got damaged\n",
      "teacher: OK so no-one was badly hurt - that's the importnat thing\n",
      "student: I was nervous because I didn't want to be late for work so I just took their telephone number\n",
      "teacher: and on your first day you said - you mean of driving or of your job?\n",
      "student: The funny thing was that they rang their insurance company earlier than me and made up a story\n",
      "student: They said that it was my fault so I had to fix my car and pay for it. I learnt the lesson ;)\n",
      "teacher: Oh no! I guess you can never tell what people are going to do...\n",
      "teacher: Thanks <STUDENT> -  Yes we say ‘on the road’ to talk in general – ‘in’ the road is like a specific place in space do you see?  So for example do we say sleep ‘in’ or ‘on’ the street for rough sleepers do you think?\n",
      "student: I don't really understand your question '-you mean of driving or of your job?'\n",
      "student: It was my first day at work 10 years ago\n",
      "teacher: Sorry I meant was it your first day driving after you passed your test or your first day at your new job but you've answered that now I see...!\n",
      "student: OK thank you!\n",
      "student: About on or in the road\n",
      "student: I would say that they sleep on the street\n",
      "student: Is it correct?\n",
      "teacher: Yes that's right! Because it's not a real spot you know...OK <STUDENT> - look at at the following phrases/words and then back at your story and tell me how you can use them ok?\n",
      "teacher: pull out / get out / shaken up / get my car fixed / - if you don't know one just leave it\n",
      "teacher: as in you need to replace/correct with these\n",
      "student: I'll try...\n",
      "student: No idea about pull out\n",
      "student: I think I should have said 'they got out of their car...'\n",
      "teacher: Yes! Sorry one more: ironically you don’t really say ‘come out’ of a car and you don’t say ‘do’ a stop really BUT you can say ‘come to a stop’ (often implies gradually) – you know that phrase right? Like ‘come to an end’ and similar phrases\n",
      "teacher: Actually because gradually not really appropriate in your story to be honest...\n",
      "student: Yes, I know 'come to an end' but I didn't know 'come to a stop.' How do you use it??\n",
      "teacher: Well ...for example ...if your car runs out of petrol it might start making noises and then come to a stop by the side of the road  (as in slowly/gradually/not all of a suddden)\n",
      "student: I'll try to use 'shaken up' now. 'I was shaken up' instead of 'I was nervous'??\n",
      "teacher: Or a plane might skid across the runway and then come to a stop etc...!\n",
      "teacher: Yes that's good for shaken up!\n",
      "teacher: By the experience you know - suggests soemthing a bit more traumatic or with an adrenaline rush\n",
      "student: Now I understand how to use 'come to a stop'. Thanks!\n",
      "teacher: although I understand maybe you wre just saying nervous because you were worried about getting to work\n",
      "teacher: but 'shaken up' definitely common/good for this event\n",
      "student: But how do you say that there was a stop sign and she didn't do it?? That was the reason why her car crashed into mine\n",
      "teacher: Ah OK ... well, it the US they say 'run a stop sign' which is logical...wait a sec\n",
      "teacher: but for me as a BRitish person I guess I'd say maybe 'I had right of way' or 'it was my right of way'\n",
      "teacher: The thing is we don't really have signs saying STOP on them in the UK you see\n",
      "student: I understand\n",
      "teacher: So ‘pull out’ is when you drive from one road onto another (especially from a junction)\n",
      "teacher: As in you're stopped and then you move into the traffic/other road - it's really  common\n",
      "student: Really?? haha I didn't know that (no stop signs in the UK)\n",
      "teacher: No!Do you know I remember the first time I went to Spain I was really confused when I Saw a stop sigh because it was written in English!\n",
      "student: hahahah that's funny\n",
      "teacher: Listen <STUDENT> - 'pull' = really common for driving i.e. pull out/pull in/ pull over\n",
      "student: Pull out' wow this is a very difficult phrasal verb...\n",
      "teacher: Yeah...! So 'out' is into traffic/ 'in' is like we pulled in at the servcie station or whatever and pull over is when you stop by the side of the road!\n",
      "teacher: But all really common\n",
      "student: OK, thank you. I'll write them down\n",
      "teacher: OK ...you're happy with e.g. 'I got my car fixed' right - I'm sure you know it ....\n",
      "student: So 'pull in' means that you stop somewhere??\n",
      "teacher: Yes - at  a place I guess ..but confusingly...it can also be used for the same as pull over actually sorry! or 'had my car fixed'  = the same\n",
      "student: Sure, 'I got my car fixed' I guess I use 'to get' because I don't fix it myself??\n",
      "teacher: Yes that's right - seems like a small thing and you do hear people say 'I fixed the car' but this structure with get more normal....as in I had/got my hair cut much more common than I cut my hair yes\n",
      "student: I understand!\n",
      "student: understand\n",
      "teacher: OK - <STUDENT> sorry for the stupid question but...are there motorways in the CAnary ISlands ?\n",
      "student: haha it is not a stupid question. Yes there are motorways. What a coincidence, yesterday I had a conversation about it. We talked about how long we have had them\n",
      "teacher: Right...so how long would it take to drive around Tenerife?\n",
      "student: I know it isn't right but I don't know how to say that... can you say that the motorway is 50 years old?? I don't think so\n",
      "teacher: No that's fine! Are you worried because it's a thing? no it's normal...or fo course 'we've had motoways for 50 years\n",
      "student: I'm not sure how long it would take but I think it wouldn't take more than 4 hours\n",
      "teacher: or it was built 50 years a go or whatever\n",
      "teacher: OK 4 hours - well in fact you can drive quite a lot of the length of England in that tie\n",
      "teacher: time\n",
      "student: Thank you!! yes, I didn't know if you could use 'years old' for things...\n",
      "teacher: did you ever drive in the UK?\n",
      "teacher: OK yes! e.g. these shoes are a year old/my house is 80 years old etc etc\n",
      "student: Sorry, my laptop ran out of battery but I'm back\n",
      "teacher: OK great!\n",
      "teacher: Sorry did you ever drive in the UK?\n",

      "teacher: Oh no! That sounds like another  depressing story about miserable, grey England...\n",
      "teacher: and cold\n",
      "student: It was tricky, but having a bike since I moved there helped me a lot.\n",

      "student: Yes, I know 'come to an end' but I didn't know 'come to a stop.' How do you use it??\n",

      "teacher: Ah OK ... well, it the US they say 'run a stop sign' which is logical...wait a sec\n",
      "teacher: but for me as a BRitish person I guess I'd say maybe 'I had right of way' or 'it was my right of way'\n",
      "teacher: The thing is we don't really have signs saying STOP on them in the UK you see\n",
      "student: I understand\n",
      "teacher: So ‘pull out’ is when you drive from one road onto another (especially from a junction)\n",
      "teacher: As in you're stopped and then you move into the traffic/other road - it's really  common\n",
      "student: Really?? haha I didn't know that (no stop signs in the UK)\n",

      "student: Pull out' wow this is a very difficult phrasal verb...\n",
      "teacher: Yeah...! So 'out' is into traffic/ 'in' is like we pulled in at the servcie station or whatever and pull over is when you stop by the side of the road!\n",
      "teacher: But all really common\n",
      "student: OK, thank you. I'll write them down\n",
      "teacher: OK ...you're happy with e.g. 'I got my car fixed' right - I'm sure you know it ....\n",
      "student: So 'pull in' means that you stop somewhere??\n",
      "teacher: Yes - at  a place I guess ..but confusingly...it can also be used for the same as pull over actually sorry! or 'had my car fixed'  = the same\n",
      "student: Sure, 'I got my car fixed' I guess I use 'to get' because I don't fix it myself??\n",
      "teacher: Yes that's right - seems like a small thing and you do hear people say 'I fixed the car' but this structure with get more normal....as in I had/got my hair cut much more common than I cut my hair yes\n",
      "student: I understand!\n",
      "student: understand\n",
      "teacher: OK - \u001b[6;30;42m<STUDENT>\u001b[0m sorry for the stupid question but...are there motorways in the CAnary ISlands ?\n",
      "student: haha it is not a stupid question. Yes there are motorways. What a coincidence, yesterday I had a conversation about it. We talked about how long we have had them\n",
      "teacher: Right...so how long would it take to drive around Tenerife?\n",
      "student: I know it isn't right but I don't know how to say that... can you say that the motorway is 50 years old?? I don't think so\n",
      "teacher: No that's fine! Are you worried because it's a thing? no it's normal...or fo course 'we've had motoways for 50 years\n",
      "student: I'm not sure how long it would take but I think it wouldn't take more than 4 hours\n",
      "teacher: or it was built 50 years a go or whatever\n",
      "teacher: OK 4 hours - well in fact you can drive quite a lot of the length of England in that tie\n",
      "teacher: time\n",
      "student: Thank you!! yes, I didn't know if you could use 'years old' for things...\n",
      "teacher: did you ever drive in the UK?\n",
      "teacher: OK yes! e.g. these shoes are a year old/my house is 80 years old etc etc\n",
      "student: Sorry, my laptop ran out of battery but I'm back\n",
      "teacher: OK great!\n",
      "teacher: Sorry did you ever drive in the UK?\n",
      "student: Good examples (shoes and house)\n",
      "student: About driving in the UK\n",
      "student: Yes, I rented a car for a month one of the winters I spent there\n",
      "teacher: OK right..you can guess my next question! Was it OK driving on the left?\n",
      "teacher: I mean the correct side\n",
      "student: I hated the cold so much that I thought that having a car I would enjoy my life more, but it wasn't really like that\n",
      "teacher: Oh no! That sounds like another  depressing story about miserable, grey England...\n",
      "teacher: and cold\n",
      "student: It was tricky, but having a bike since I moved there helped me a lot.\n",
      "teacher: Yes bikes are great in some places here\n",
      "student: hahah yes, depressing long grey winters...\n",
      "teacher: aahh stop\n",
      "student: hahah\n",
      "student: Is it grey today??\n",
      "teacher: ACtually right now it's sunny!!!!\n",
      "teacher: Give it 30 years it'll be a paradies\n",
      "student: Fantastic!! Leave the laptop and go out :)\n",

      "teacher: Yes OK thanks \u001b[6;30;42m<STUDENT>\u001b[0m - I'll say goodbye - Il email you after this about another lesson OK? Thanks...\n",
      "student: I got a bit crazy about the sun when I lived there and even after. I couldn't be indoors when it was sunny\n",
      "teacher: I can imagine if you're used to that kind  of weather....OK bye\n",

      "student: Sure, 'I got my car fixed' I guess I use 'to get' because I don't fix it myself??\n",

      "student: I'm not sure how long it would take but I think it wouldn't take more than 4 hours\n",
      "teacher: or it was built 50 years a go or whatever\n",

      "teacher: and cold\n",
