      "1. Challenge: Describe your challenge, including all relevant information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Obesity and junk eating is not good for health, especially for children. How to prevent kids from  eating junk food? Can we inculcate good eating habits from an early age? How can we  encourage kids to eat more fruits and vegetables? These are some of the questions I have been  thinking a lot recently as I have a young kid. I was thinking of ways to have kids choose fruits  and vegetables on their own from grocery stores, and if so, how I can design their experience in  a sustainable way that changes their eating and shopping behaviour for life.\n",

      "2. Selection: In your own words, briefly describe the tool you selected (e.g., what it is and why\n",
      "\n",
      "you selected it for your challenge -- including any appropriate video lecture references).    In module 2 Nathan Collins spoke that \"…storytelling puts human beings and their experience  front and center…” Storytelling, I felt, was a great way to relate to children and bring about  behaviour change in them in a way that they would enjoy the whole transformational journey.  Children like stories and remember them well for a long time.\n",

      "3. Application: Describe how you applied the tool you selected to your challenge (e.g., what you\n",
      "\n",
      "did and how the tool was applied effectively or ineffectively).    I started with creating typical personas of children between ages 4 and 9. This is the most  impressionable age for kids and anything they learn in this period remains for life. Following is  an example of a persona I created:     Maya’s mom takes her grocery shopping every week and it is usually the highlight of her week. She loves being\n",
      "\n",
      "able to run around the grocery store and her mom lets her pick out one snack every time she goes (though she can  usually sneak in a couple extra snacks). Her favourite part of the grocery store is the chip aisle because she loves  looking at all of the different options and her mom usually lets her pick out her favourite one to have as a snack after  their shopping visit. Her favourite chip to buy is Cheetos because she thinks they look pretty cool and she remembers  seeing Chester the Tiger when she was watching TV. Maya is starting to want to feel more independent. She loves it  when her mom lets her push the grocery cart herself because she feels so grown up doing the same thing her mom  does. She also enjoys helping her mom pick out what they’re going to eat that week. She loves to help her mom  cook, especially when she gets to mix stuff on her own. Her favourite foods to eat at home are chicken, potatoes,  oranges, and cookies. She likes to eat fruit when her mom gives it to her at home but she never picks it out at the  grocery store. CHALLENGE: How can we encourage Maya to choose fruit as a snack at the grocery store?     Doing this helped me empathize with children and better understand their drivers of behaviour  of picking junk food in stores. Understanding their perspective was critical in coming out with  ideas, concepts, experiments, and final solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Insight: Describe the insight you gained from applying the tool you selected to your challenge\n",
      "\n",
      "(e.g., how an insight affected your thinking about the challenge and about design thinking  more broadly).    First insight was that children are more likely to eat something if they pick it out themselves,  but there is little opportunity to do so in grocery stores. So my design goal was to give children  a sense of autonomy and independence in selection of own food. Second insight was that  parents easily get manipulated into buying even when they know its unhealthy. One solution I\n",

      "thought was that every time a kid chooses fruit or healthy food, there would be celebrations or  some gift given by store. The rewards should appeal to children. This would encourage children  to do more of this and over time this could become a habit.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Approach: Describe what you might do differently next time -- applying the same tool you\n",
      "\n",
      "selected or a different one -- and the reason(s) why.    Learning more about a challenge often exposes more of what a team doesn’t know.  Therefore, a strong team is needed for best results which is passionate about the challenge,  open to learning through experience and comfortable with the iterative nature of the  process. Repeatedly learning by doing is often the best and most efficient way to find a  solution. We came up with many ideas such as creating small shopping carts for kids,  coloring fruits and vegie aisles with colors and cartoon characters, creating games around  fruits, fruit toys, etc. No idea is bad! Out of over 20 ideas we selected 2 for concept, and out  of those 2 we selected the idea of creating a small shopping cart that kids can carry alone.  This shopping cart will have pictures of fruits that kids have to match with actual fruits.  When they select they are rewarded with candies or gifts. They can at the end attach this  cart to the usual cart with their parent or guardian. This small cart encourages self-reliance  and gives a sense of autonomy which growing kids demand. Also, a rewarding experience  forms a habit of buying healthy food at a young age.\n",

Also bring expert people such as gamers and professional activities  creators gives a different perspective because lot of times we get stuck in functional  fixedness that doesn’t allow us to thing outside box during ideating phase.\n",
